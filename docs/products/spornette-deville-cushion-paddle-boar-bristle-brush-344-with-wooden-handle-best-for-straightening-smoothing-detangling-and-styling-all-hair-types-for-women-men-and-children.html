            <li>I have been looking for a good brush for a while</li>
            <li>it also looks good and appears as though it is sturdy just by the quality of the manufacturing.</li>

            <li>Nice brush</li>
            <li>My own fault, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4 and not a 5</li>
            <li>After a good brushing, my hair is actually more luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the brush, but do not expect miracles in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a good job of redistributing hair oils and taming frizz, you probably already knew that, but my biggest love for this brush is how it feels on the scalp.</li>

            <li>It makes my beard nice and shiny.</li>

            <li>This is an excellent hairbrush, very solid and feels great.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle is great, hand the brush does perfectly the job!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I read in a hair care book that boar bristle brushes would be good for maintaining healthy hair.</li>

            <li>The best hair brush I ever had, and I am 66 years old.</li>
            <li>Good feel in the hand, good balance, and the bristles are perfect - stiff but not brusque.</li>
            <li>Great brush, kind of large though.</li>
            <li>The heft will give it a great \\&quot;thuddy\\&quot; sensation, and make some great bruises for you to admire later on.    </li>

            <li>Since using the BBB, my hair is shinier, smoother, glossier, and more moisturized.  </li>

            <li>I love love love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, the size of this brush is probably better suited for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li>but she has static too</li>
            <li>shaft better than any of my plastic brushes</li>
            <li>Additionally, it causes so much static.</li>

            <li>So in love.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much for getting out tangles but does a great job smoothing and brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush many times and have never had a problem with tangling</li>
            <li>so was sure it would be ok for my hair.</li>

            <li>For anyone who wears very short hair, and is looking for a great hairbrush, and they don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg, this would be a wise purchase.  </li>
            <li>It was ok</li>

            <li>E.G. the vanity top.  </li>

            <li>I was expecting something of a more manageable size.  </li>
            <li>What can I say about this brush besides the fact that I love it.</li>
            <li>However, it does cause static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>it does help incredibly with getting my natural hair oils spread throughout my hair.</li>

            <li>I love this brush, it makes my hair softer, distributes my natural hair olis throughout my hair, feels great on my head when I brush,</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good brush for the price I paid for it, but I dont really like it.</li>
            <li>Good for gently scratching an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>The brush is very well constructed and a good product.  </li>
            <li>This brush might be more useful for those with very fine or even curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s large and just amazing.</li>
            <li>I have never used any other BBB, but my hair thinks this one is the best!</li>
            <li>First of all, love this brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is sooo sweet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll lose a few when I brush tonight, but this is incredibly awesome.  </li>
            <li>Quality wood and easy on the hand.</li>
            <li>Overall, this brush is excellent and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This goes through my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The bristles arn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>This is my first boar bristle brush, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t stop brushing for about 20 minutes because it just felt so amazing.</li>
            <li>I had a head full of static.  </li>
            <li>this brush is nice, not too harsh on hair, good quality and nice size.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy but dense hair.  </li>
            <li>price from the seller was wonderful, less than $20</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but curly.</li>
            <li>my husband has been looking for this type brush for a long time great buy love it, would buy again</li>
            <li>But non the less it&#x27;s a great sturdy brush!</li>
            <li>Fine by me.</li>
            <li>it was so wimpy, and I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>But I get compliments on the shine, quick growing length, and healthy hair</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift for someone that wanted to try boar bristles and she really does love it!</li>
            <li>This has become an indispensable tool in my hair-care arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it</li>
            <li>It works as it should and it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great for short hair!  </li>
            <li>so it just makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This is not 100% genuine boar bristle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth when it brushes my hair.</li>
            <li>A great brush, just bigger than I expected.....check your dimensions!</li>
            <li>I never knew your choice of brush was so important</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit of styling oil and that tames any fly away hair as well.</li>
            <li>I have the smaller 2 sided brush that is very popular on here.</li>
            <li>This boar bristle brush is great for smoothing my frizzies, or after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter likes the brush very much.</li>
            <li>And it is super easy to clean.   </li>
            <li>I leave it on the bathroom counter, and it makes a very nice decorative item, plus it&#x27;s handy to use whilst galloping past the mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to add that if you enjoy spanking your consenting adult partner, this brush should be a perfect implement for such an activity.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>The boar bristle brush is great for women who are trying to grow long, undamaged hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>So this works great to leave long locks of curls.</li>
            <li>Definitely great for freezy long hair gals.</li>
            <li>, also I like the quality of its handle, lovely wood and very sturdy!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t clean the hair as boar bristle brushes are supposed to be notorious for doing.  </li>
            <li>This brush puts such an amazing glossy look to my hair, I love it.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of using this brush I noticed that I was not seeing as many fly aways.</li>
            <li>Wears VERY well, easy to clean!</li>
            <li>It leaves both of us with very shiny, very smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful wooden handle and is very well constructed.  </li>
            <li>It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review.</li>
            <li>my hair is much easier to brush, perhaps that makes me like this brush more.</li>
            <li>I still use it regularly &amp; its still in good condition.</li>
            <li>The reviews loved this, but I have to say it is not for anyone with short hair.</li>
            <li>Brush\\&quot; is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I recently had all my hair cut off and needed a good brush.  </li>
            <li>We clean the brush once a month with shampoo, and comb it out quickly after every use over the sink.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff and feel good on the scalp, and boar bristles help distribute oils from the scalp to the ends of your hair to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a lovely color and feels nice to hold, not too heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Great brush for flat brushing the hair when drying very thick/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy, which feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job to me than a light, plastic brush.</li>
            <li>Good for long hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels great against my scalp and has made any trace of dandruff go away as it distributes the oils down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li>I think it works great for fine hair to add shine and distribute oils, i use it to dry my hair and its super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft and makes my hair FULL of static.</li>
            <li>Should have looked there first!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo &amp; water.</li>
            <li>They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo &amp; water.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very sturdy, but comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t damage or break my hairs at all.</li>
            <li>I think the air in the paddle brush makes it a bit cushier than we wanted but FAR better than brushes we have found in the store.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my hair is static ridden during the winter, and heard natural hair brushes help with that.  </li>
            <li>After the tangles are removed I can brush from the top of head to the bottom, distributing oils to ends just like they told us to do in the old days; although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing 100 strokes, ha ha.</li>
            <li>and now I have shiny healthy looking hair that professional hair stylists have commented on.</li>
            <li>For a brush to be able to spread the natural oils in your hair, it must reach the scalp where their located.</li>
            <li>And the bristles are not the quality soft ones that I loved about my old brush.</li>
            <li>However, it is incredibly soft and feels lovely against your scalp.</li>
            <li>It helps to distribute the natural oils on your hair and keeps its healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that comes to the top of my thighs &amp; while I didn&#x27;t expect this to be able to get through my hair in one stroke, it does much better than other bristle type brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>This is a good boar bristle brush overall, with one main flaw.</li>
            <li>THE BOAR BRISTLES ARE GOOD FOR YOUR SCALP AND MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW WITHOUT PULLING OUT YOUR HAIR LIKE OTHER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li>In China\\&quot; emblazened on the front part of the handle right under the company name.</li>
            <li>They melted right away as I was blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>and I found myself not wanting to use the brush unless my hair had just been washed since I didn&#x27;t feel like I could really get it clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review.itled &amp;#34;How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush.&amp;#34;  It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it or you will cause damage and breakage.  </li>
            <li>This barely gets through my hair and the bristles that are plastic cause my hair to get static</li>
            <li>It is strong but soft to the hair.</li>
            <li>we brushed her hair with my old boar&#x27;s hair brush and she loved it...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a reason to suspect it is not a real boar bristle; but even if it isn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t care &#x3D;)!</li>
            <li>It was a quality brush with stiff nylon bristles, so it was excellent for managing my short hair.  </li>
            <li>it feels good as i brush though my hair and keeping my waves tight.</li>
            <li>This hair brush arrived very fast and the brush itself suits my needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this hoping it would be sturdy enough for some over-the-knee spanking... Was not disappointed; works fantastic and has held up.  </li>
            <li>and I believe I was able to purchase other items from Amazon to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It was great at shorter length, but I need the full width of this paddle to properly brush myself without the hair getting caught on the other side.</li>
            <li>As a straighty, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a straighty, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.  </li>
            <li>the simple act of brushing each morning and evening is rather peaceful and almost meditative:)</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t brush deeply it also does not deliver that famous shine that you get from a boar bristle brush either.  </li>
            <li>Also, be aware that boar bristle brushes are not detangling brushes.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I need for my hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles melted the first time I used it with my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is great for longer and long hair, but anything that resembles a man&#x27;s cut seems a torture (if used extensively).</li>
            <li>Neither of us use hair products, so if you do use mousses, gels, etc, you may want to wash your brush more often, possibly with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We suggest that you only run a comb from the bottom of the bristles to the top to remove any excess hair.  </li>
            <li>you for supporting Spornette</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for-</li>
            <li>I do have to detangle my hair first, but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job very well !</li>
            <li>Need to brush first with the Olivia mix bristle and boar brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a soft/stiff combo that surprisingly is great for my thick shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle and back is one solid piece, and it&#x27;s a beautiful, rich color.</li>
            <li>It replaced a very old brush that was many years old.</li>
            <li>However, my 14yr old son, who has shoulder length hair with much more texture &amp; curl to it (and uses conventional shampoo) says this is his favorite brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>But it would be better if the bristles were a little longer and there was a comfortable grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>Other than making my hair a bit staticy, I think it is a nice brush.  </li>
            <li>It really helps smooth and spread out my natural oils</li>
            <li>Still, it feels nice when I&#x27;m brushing my hair - soft enough to not feel scratchy, big enough to cover a good area of scalp at a time.</li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the brush was the strong plastic smell that it had when it was first unpackaged.</li>
            <li>My husband after YEARS of having his favorite brush had to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;This is bigger and better than his last one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rip out as many of my long, admittedly thinning, gray hairs.</li>
            <li>feels a bit like acrylic bristles as it makes my hair incredibly frizzy... running my hands through it after I brush brings it back down to normal though.</li>
            <li>But I use my boar bristle brush every night to brush my hair and make it super soft.   </li>
            <li>This makes it so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down, yet it is very well conditioned from my own sebum.  </li>
            <li>This brush is good for distributing the natural oils in your scalp down to the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not too large</li>
            <li>The bristles appear to be fragile in that I could easily pull them from the paddle, but it isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li>If you are male, or you have fine hair, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>However, I really was interested in this brush because of the overall good reviews and cheap price and so talked myself into thinking that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick as the people who said it didn&#x27;t work for them....</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered this brush to help distribute the natural oils of the scalp/roots down to the ends and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li>It really doesnt brush my hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.  </li>
            <li>It really redistributes the oils from the scalp to make hair smoother.</li>
            <li>The change in my hair is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I just happen to really like paddle brushes this size.  </li>
            <li>It really softens and smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li>so I have to brush it in layers to really get to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not out much money</li>
            <li>I can feel it gently on my scalp, kinda like a massage.  </li>
            <li>but it takes so much longer</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle to release knots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush and it does make my hair much smoother.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to help blend my real hair into my clip in hair extensions when I wear them straight.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it did that much for it</li>
            <li>Checked many brushes and felt this was more expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, so basically you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My last hair brush was a cheap brush I brought from a grocery store for $5.</li>
            <li>With this brush I brush my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting in a brush.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair very static-y and does not brush out knots.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles aren&#x27;t like the others, and there does seem to be actual boar bristle in here, but the brush I used to have that was genuine</li>
            <li>I did not use much with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about this brush not being good for thick hair</li>
            <li>I mainly use this for just brushing the top of my hair, my hair is too thick to use this to detangle, but my roommate has one that she uses on her thinner hair just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it very useful for getting my bangs to stay combed back and for smoothing out that hair under a ponytail.      </li>
            <li>I still use that other brush, but I find myself turning to this one more &amp;</li>
            <li>Other than that, I felt this was an okay investment and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I put the top half of my hair up with a clip and brush the bottom first, then put it all down and brush the top part of my head, so I can reach my scalp on all parts of my head for the benefits.</li>
            <li>This is good if you don&#x27;t need to get out serious tangles.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty nice, except I have thick hair, and the bristles don&#x27;t reach my scalp the way I would like.</li>
            <li>I have average thickness hair (a 7.5 cm ponytail circumference), and would love it if I got another centimeter added to my circumference.  </li>
            <li>Use a normal, wider-toothed brush to detangle first, then indulge in a few minutes of brushing with your boar bristle brush. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use shampoo any more and this brush moves the oils down my hair</li>
            <li>My hair retains its shine, and my baby hairs lay down better after using this brush.</li>
            <li>wear a very short flat top, and this keeps my hair up straight in front.</li>
            <li>handle, too, is shaped so that it is easy to hold, but that&#x27;s not really</li>
            <li>I am finding that I do not need near as much leave-in conditioner or as much oil applied to my length.  </li>
            <li>But they do a decent job of pretending that it is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the price was low</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t owned a boar bristle brush before, but the quality seems decent.  </li>
            <li>I plucked a bristle and burned it, it curled and smelled like hair, the product is real, and works really well for distributing the natural oils from your scalp.  </li>
            <li>This will smooth your hair right to your head with none of those little hairs sticking up.  </li>
            <li>This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush.eel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy and the brush seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It was becoming especially dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>Of course the whole idea of a natural bristle brush is to condition your hair by distributing your natural hair oil throughout the length of your hair and when it is first washed there isn&#x27;t much, if any, natural oil to distribute.  </li>
            <li>Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  </li>
            <li>Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair a little static</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on hair, much better than yanking at knots with a hard plastic brush.  </li>
            <li>It is winter right now, and I have less static than I did prior to using the BBB.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves it because it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it did before.</li>
            <li>I gently comb out tangles with a wide-toothed comb and then brush my hair in sections with the boar bristle brush because, as others have said, this brush is too soft to penetrate to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair (not thick), yet the bristles do not even reach my scalp, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m caucasian &amp; my hair is nearly to my waist and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a normal paddle brush size.</li>
            <li>Not great, but good.  </li>
            <li>star rating represents a combo of good and poor features:  quality look and construction, gigantic size and weight.</li>
            <li>It is very thick bristle and it is 100% boar, but I liked the other spornette I bought better.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is the that the bristles are not really long and aren&#x27;t good at actually styling hair.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a bonus, too, to this new regime -  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to any sadists needing a new toy for the toy bag.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and am able to blow it straight every day.  </li>
            <li>This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush.</li>
            <li>I have hip-length, very straight, fine, medium thick normal hair.</li>
            <li>It replaced a very old bristle brush that was worn out.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on it!</li>
            <li>When I first got this brush and opened it, my husband remarked about how big it was.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it would be too big, but it is not.</li>
            <li>It is made of real wood and real boar bristles (unlike some other products I have received from amazon...), and feels amazingly sturdy, even when I brush through my thick, unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft, very soft on my long,long hair.</li>
            <li>I have since grown to love how soft it is when combing out my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li>only problem I have with this brush is that the \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; is a bit large.  </li>
            <li>I brush now every night just like in the old days.  </li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t impacted its performance thus far, but I expect I will need to replace this brush eventually.  </li>

            <li>I am a transplant from California to far northern Minnesota.  </li>
            <li>I have learned that the Spornette DeVille boar bristle paddle brush is for brushing your hair, for distributing your natural oil throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Its been nearly two years since I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush distributes my natural oils</li>
            <li>This brush (or any boar bristle brush) makes my hair extremely soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to a modern brush after buying this boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I needed this so I could brush my locks completely thru.</li>
            <li>The hair is so shiny and soft when using this brush as a drying aid.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li>but it is to soft for me.</li>
            <li>The whole back is gone now</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>a brush that would spread out my hair&#x27;s natural oils from root to end.</li>
            <li>The entire brush is also very well constructed.</li>
            <li>This is the most common issue people do not understand about Boar brushes.</li>
            <li>A bit too soft for my liking.</li>
            <li>I started using this brush because I bought NaturOli soapnut shampoo, which also helps with leaving natural hair oils in.</li>
            <li>I said, &amp;#34;Pooh Baby (20 yr old)...</li>
            <li>maybe my hair was more of a medium thick?</li>
            <li>worked a lot better and got through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice if you have thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say this would be a great brush for those who have normal, less thick hair.</li>
            <li>I had really been wanting to see if a natural bristle brush would make any difference with the frizziness of my long naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and while the brush sleeks it out at first, after I sleep on it, it is wavy again in the morning and the curls are much less frizzy than normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;d hold up on curlier hair types (and it might be a little too much for very fine hair to handle)</li>
            <li>great brush, i have thick long curly hair and tames my my wild mess</li>
            <li>My normal shed rate prior to using a boar bristle brush (BBB) was 25-30 hairs a day, and on wash days I was losing 40-50 hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth slowing yourself down and watching all the way through.  </li>
            <li>I did think the bristles were stiff enough that it did feel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is huge, at least for men.</li>
            <li>It is big and sturdy and soft.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why it does not have 5 stars is what I stated (too soft)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a rectangular brush, maybe 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, no big &#x27;handle&#x27; , with soft quality bristles.  </li>
            <li>No loose bristles at all.</li>
            <li>It quickly wore off but was very offputting, and I nearly assumed it was a fake from the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it dissipates after the first few brush strokes.  </li>
            <li>the first few I came across were out of my price range.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle-but it doesn&#x27;t work for my older daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li>I am African American with 3c curly type natural hair to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>I think because I&#x27;m pressing down so hard in an effort to have the bristles reach my scalp, it flattens my hair more than I&#x27;d like, although I guess some people make call this &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little large.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really believe they would sell a hair brush you could not clean.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned, it&#x27;s large and somewhat heavy, but works well for my fairly short hair.</li>

            <li> it also looks good and appears as though it is sturdy just by the quality of the manufacturing.</li>

            <li> Nice brush</li>
            <li> My own fault, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4 and not a 5</li>
            <li> After a good brushing, my hair is actually more luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the brush, but do not expect miracles in your hair.</li>

            <li> I love love love this brush.  </li>

            <li> but she has static too</li>
            <li> shaft better than any of my plastic brushes</li>
            <li> Additionally, it causes so much static.</li>

            <li> I love the consistency of the bristles.</li>

            <li> It was ok</li>

            <li> E.G. the vanity top.  </li>

            <li> I was expecting something of a more manageable size.  </li>
            <li> What can I say about this brush besides the fact that I love it.</li>
            <li> However, it does cause static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> it does help incredibly with getting my natural hair oils spread throughout my hair.</li>

            <li> I thought it would be a good brush for the price I paid for it, but I dont really like it.</li>
            <li> Good for gently scratching an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush is very well constructed and a good product.  </li>
            <li> This brush might be more useful for those with very fine or even curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s large and just amazing.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other BBB, but my hair thinks this one is the best!</li>

            <li> This brush is sooo sweet!</li>

            <li> This goes through my hair easily.  </li>

            <li> I had a head full of static.  </li>
            <li> this brush is nice, not too harsh on hair, good quality and nice size.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy but dense hair.  </li>

            <li> my husband has been looking for this type brush for a long time great buy love it, would buy again</li>
            <li> But non the less it&#x27;s a great sturdy brush!</li>
            <li> Fine by me.</li>
            <li> it was so wimpy, and I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> But I get compliments on the shine, quick growing length, and healthy hair</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift for someone that wanted to try boar bristles and she really does love it!</li>
            <li> This has become an indispensable tool in my hair-care arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it</li>
            <li> It works as it should and it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great for short hair!  </li>
            <li> so it just makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% genuine boar bristle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth when it brushes my hair.</li>
            <li> A great brush, just bigger than I expected.....check your dimensions!</li>
            <li> I never knew your choice of brush was so important</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit of styling oil and that tames any fly away hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have the smaller 2 sided brush that is very popular on here.</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush is great for smoothing my frizzies, or after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter likes the brush very much.</li>
            <li> And it is super easy to clean.   </li>
            <li> I leave it on the bathroom counter, and it makes a very nice decorative item, plus it&#x27;s handy to use whilst galloping past the mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to add that if you enjoy spanking your consenting adult partner, this brush should be a perfect implement for such an activity.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> The boar bristle brush is great for women who are trying to grow long, undamaged hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> So this works great to leave long locks of curls.</li>
            <li> Definitely great for freezy long hair gals.</li>
            <li> , also I like the quality of its handle, lovely wood and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t clean the hair as boar bristle brushes are supposed to be notorious for doing.  </li>
            <li> This brush puts such an amazing glossy look to my hair, I love it.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using this brush I noticed that I was not seeing as many fly aways.</li>
            <li> Wears VERY well, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> It leaves both of us with very shiny, very smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful wooden handle and is very well constructed.  </li>
            <li> It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> my hair is much easier to brush, perhaps that makes me like this brush more.</li>
            <li> I still use it regularly &amp; its still in good condition.</li>
            <li> The reviews loved this, but I have to say it is not for anyone with short hair.</li>
            <li> Brush\\&quot; is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I recently had all my hair cut off and needed a good brush.  </li>
            <li> We clean the brush once a month with shampoo, and comb it out quickly after every use over the sink.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and feel good on the scalp, and boar bristles help distribute oils from the scalp to the ends of your hair to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a lovely color and feels nice to hold, not too heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Great brush for flat brushing the hair when drying very thick/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy, which feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job to me than a light, plastic brush.</li>
            <li> Good for long hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels great against my scalp and has made any trace of dandruff go away as it distributes the oils down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li> I think it works great for fine hair to add shine and distribute oils, i use it to dry my hair and its super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft and makes my hair FULL of static.</li>
            <li> Should have looked there first!  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo &amp; water.</li>
            <li> They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo &amp; water.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very sturdy, but comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t damage or break my hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I think the air in the paddle brush makes it a bit cushier than we wanted but FAR better than brushes we have found in the store.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair is static ridden during the winter, and heard natural hair brushes help with that.  </li>
            <li> After the tangles are removed I can brush from the top of head to the bottom, distributing oils to ends just like they told us to do in the old days; although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing 100 strokes, ha ha.</li>
            <li> and now I have shiny healthy looking hair that professional hair stylists have commented on.</li>
            <li> For a brush to be able to spread the natural oils in your hair, it must reach the scalp where their located.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are not the quality soft ones that I loved about my old brush.</li>
            <li> However, it is incredibly soft and feels lovely against your scalp.</li>
            <li> It helps to distribute the natural oils on your hair and keeps its healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that comes to the top of my thighs &amp; while I didn&#x27;t expect this to be able to get through my hair in one stroke, it does much better than other bristle type brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is a good boar bristle brush overall, with one main flaw.</li>
            <li> THE BOAR BRISTLES ARE GOOD FOR YOUR SCALP AND MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW WITHOUT PULLING OUT YOUR HAIR LIKE OTHER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> In China\\&quot; emblazened on the front part of the handle right under the company name.</li>
            <li> They melted right away as I was blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> and I found myself not wanting to use the brush unless my hair had just been washed since I didn&#x27;t feel like I could really get it clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review.itled &amp;#34;How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush.&amp;#34;  It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it or you will cause damage and breakage.  </li>
            <li> This barely gets through my hair and the bristles that are plastic cause my hair to get static</li>
            <li> It is strong but soft to the hair.</li>
            <li> we brushed her hair with my old boar&#x27;s hair brush and she loved it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a reason to suspect it is not a real boar bristle; but even if it isn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t care &#x3D;)!</li>
            <li> It was a quality brush with stiff nylon bristles, so it was excellent for managing my short hair.  </li>
            <li> it feels good as i brush though my hair and keeping my waves tight.</li>
            <li> This hair brush arrived very fast and the brush itself suits my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would be sturdy enough for some over-the-knee spanking... Was not disappointed; works fantastic and has held up.  </li>
            <li> and I believe I was able to purchase other items from Amazon to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It was great at shorter length, but I need the full width of this paddle to properly brush myself without the hair getting caught on the other side.</li>
            <li> As a straighty, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a straighty, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.  </li>
            <li> the simple act of brushing each morning and evening is rather peaceful and almost meditative:)</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t brush deeply it also does not deliver that famous shine that you get from a boar bristle brush either.  </li>
            <li> Also, be aware that boar bristle brushes are not detangling brushes.  </li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I need for my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles melted the first time I used it with my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is great for longer and long hair, but anything that resembles a man&#x27;s cut seems a torture (if used extensively).</li>
            <li> Neither of us use hair products, so if you do use mousses, gels, etc, you may want to wash your brush more often, possibly with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We suggest that you only run a comb from the bottom of the bristles to the top to remove any excess hair.  </li>
            <li> you for supporting Spornette</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for-</li>
            <li> I do have to detangle my hair first, but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job very well !</li>
            <li> Need to brush first with the Olivia mix bristle and boar brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a soft/stiff combo that surprisingly is great for my thick shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle and back is one solid piece, and it&#x27;s a beautiful, rich color.</li>
            <li> It replaced a very old brush that was many years old.</li>
            <li> However, my 14yr old son, who has shoulder length hair with much more texture &amp; curl to it (and uses conventional shampoo) says this is his favorite brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> But it would be better if the bristles were a little longer and there was a comfortable grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Other than making my hair a bit staticy, I think it is a nice brush.  </li>
            <li> It really helps smooth and spread out my natural oils</li>
            <li> Still, it feels nice when I&#x27;m brushing my hair - soft enough to not feel scratchy, big enough to cover a good area of scalp at a time.</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the brush was the strong plastic smell that it had when it was first unpackaged.</li>
            <li> My husband after YEARS of having his favorite brush had to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;This is bigger and better than his last one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip out as many of my long, admittedly thinning, gray hairs.</li>
            <li> feels a bit like acrylic bristles as it makes my hair incredibly frizzy... running my hands through it after I brush brings it back down to normal though.</li>
            <li> But I use my boar bristle brush every night to brush my hair and make it super soft.   </li>
            <li> This makes it so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down, yet it is very well conditioned from my own sebum.  </li>
            <li> This brush is good for distributing the natural oils in your scalp down to the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not too large</li>
            <li> The bristles appear to be fragile in that I could easily pull them from the paddle, but it isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> If you are male, or you have fine hair, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> However, I really was interested in this brush because of the overall good reviews and cheap price and so talked myself into thinking that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick as the people who said it didn&#x27;t work for them....</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this brush to help distribute the natural oils of the scalp/roots down to the ends and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> It really doesnt brush my hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.  </li>
            <li> It really redistributes the oils from the scalp to make hair smoother.</li>
            <li> The change in my hair is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I just happen to really like paddle brushes this size.  </li>
            <li> It really softens and smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to brush it in layers to really get to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not out much money</li>
            <li> I can feel it gently on my scalp, kinda like a massage.  </li>
            <li> but it takes so much longer</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle to release knots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and it does make my hair much smoother.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to help blend my real hair into my clip in hair extensions when I wear them straight.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that it did that much for it</li>
            <li> Checked many brushes and felt this was more expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, so basically you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My last hair brush was a cheap brush I brought from a grocery store for $5.</li>
            <li> With this brush I brush my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting in a brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair very static-y and does not brush out knots.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles aren&#x27;t like the others, and there does seem to be actual boar bristle in here, but the brush I used to have that was genuine</li>
            <li> I did not use much with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this brush not being good for thick hair</li>
            <li> I mainly use this for just brushing the top of my hair, my hair is too thick to use this to detangle, but my roommate has one that she uses on her thinner hair just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very useful for getting my bangs to stay combed back and for smoothing out that hair under a ponytail.      </li>
            <li> I still use that other brush, but I find myself turning to this one more &amp;</li>
            <li> Other than that, I felt this was an okay investment and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I put the top half of my hair up with a clip and brush the bottom first, then put it all down and brush the top part of my head, so I can reach my scalp on all parts of my head for the benefits.</li>
            <li> This is good if you don&#x27;t need to get out serious tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty nice, except I have thick hair, and the bristles don&#x27;t reach my scalp the way I would like.</li>
            <li> I have average thickness hair (a 7.5 cm ponytail circumference), and would love it if I got another centimeter added to my circumference.  </li>
            <li> Use a normal, wider-toothed brush to detangle first, then indulge in a few minutes of brushing with your boar bristle brush. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo any more and this brush moves the oils down my hair</li>
            <li> My hair retains its shine, and my baby hairs lay down better after using this brush.</li>
            <li> wear a very short flat top, and this keeps my hair up straight in front.</li>
            <li> handle, too, is shaped so that it is easy to hold, but that&#x27;s not really</li>
            <li> I am finding that I do not need near as much leave-in conditioner or as much oil applied to my length.  </li>
            <li> But they do a decent job of pretending that it is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the price was low</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a boar bristle brush before, but the quality seems decent.  </li>
            <li> I plucked a bristle and burned it, it curled and smelled like hair, the product is real, and works really well for distributing the natural oils from your scalp.  </li>
            <li> This will smooth your hair right to your head with none of those little hairs sticking up.  </li>
            <li> This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush.eel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy and the brush seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was becoming especially dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Of course the whole idea of a natural bristle brush is to condition your hair by distributing your natural hair oil throughout the length of your hair and when it is first washed there isn&#x27;t much, if any, natural oil to distribute.  </li>
            <li> Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  </li>
            <li> Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little static</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on hair, much better than yanking at knots with a hard plastic brush.  </li>
            <li> It is winter right now, and I have less static than I did prior to using the BBB.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves it because it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it did before.</li>
            <li> I gently comb out tangles with a wide-toothed comb and then brush my hair in sections with the boar bristle brush because, as others have said, this brush is too soft to penetrate to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair (not thick), yet the bristles do not even reach my scalp, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m caucasian &amp; my hair is nearly to my waist and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a normal paddle brush size.</li>
            <li> Not great, but good.  </li>
            <li> star rating represents a combo of good and poor features:  quality look and construction, gigantic size and weight.</li>
            <li> It is very thick bristle and it is 100% boar, but I liked the other spornette I bought better.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is the that the bristles are not really long and aren&#x27;t good at actually styling hair.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a bonus, too, to this new regime -  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to any sadists needing a new toy for the toy bag.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and am able to blow it straight every day.  </li>
            <li> This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush.</li>
            <li> I have hip-length, very straight, fine, medium thick normal hair.</li>
            <li> It replaced a very old bristle brush that was worn out.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on it!</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush and opened it, my husband remarked about how big it was.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be too big, but it is not.</li>
            <li> It is made of real wood and real boar bristles (unlike some other products I have received from amazon...), and feels amazingly sturdy, even when I brush through my thick, unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is soft, very soft on my long,long hair.</li>
            <li> I have since grown to love how soft it is when combing out my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> only problem I have with this brush is that the \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; is a bit large.  </li>
            <li> I brush now every night just like in the old days.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t impacted its performance thus far, but I expect I will need to replace this brush eventually.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t impacted its performance thus far, but I expect I will need to replace this brush eventually.  </li>
            <li> I am a transplant from California to far northern Minnesota.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that the Spornette DeVille boar bristle paddle brush is for brushing your hair, for distributing your natural oil throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been nearly two years since I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush distributes my natural oils</li>
            <li> This brush (or any boar bristle brush) makes my hair extremely soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a modern brush after buying this boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I needed this so I could brush my locks completely thru.</li>
            <li> The hair is so shiny and soft when using this brush as a drying aid.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> but it is to soft for me.</li>
            <li> The whole back is gone now</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> a brush that would spread out my hair&#x27;s natural oils from root to end.</li>
            <li> The entire brush is also very well constructed.</li>
            <li> This is the most common issue people do not understand about Boar brushes.</li>
            <li> A bit too soft for my liking.</li>
            <li> I started using this brush because I bought NaturOli soapnut shampoo, which also helps with leaving natural hair oils in.</li>
            <li> I said, &amp;#34;Pooh Baby (20 yr old)...</li>
            <li> maybe my hair was more of a medium thick?</li>
            <li> worked a lot better and got through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice if you have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say this would be a great brush for those who have normal, less thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had really been wanting to see if a natural bristle brush would make any difference with the frizziness of my long naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and while the brush sleeks it out at first, after I sleep on it, it is wavy again in the morning and the curls are much less frizzy than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;d hold up on curlier hair types (and it might be a little too much for very fine hair to handle)</li>
            <li> great brush, i have thick long curly hair and tames my my wild mess</li>
            <li> My normal shed rate prior to using a boar bristle brush (BBB) was 25-30 hairs a day, and on wash days I was losing 40-50 hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth slowing yourself down and watching all the way through.  </li>
            <li> I did think the bristles were stiff enough that it did feel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is huge, at least for men.</li>
            <li> It is big and sturdy and soft.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why it does not have 5 stars is what I stated (too soft)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a rectangular brush, maybe 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, no big &#x27;handle&#x27; , with soft quality bristles.  </li>
            <li> No loose bristles at all.</li>
            <li> It quickly wore off but was very offputting, and I nearly assumed it was a fake from the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it dissipates after the first few brush strokes.  </li>
            <li> the first few I came across were out of my price range.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle-but it doesn&#x27;t work for my older daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with 3c curly type natural hair to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I think because I&#x27;m pressing down so hard in an effort to have the bristles reach my scalp, it flattens my hair more than I&#x27;d like, although I guess some people make call this &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little large.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really believe they would sell a hair brush you could not clean.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned, it&#x27;s large and somewhat heavy, but works well for my fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair to the middle of her back, wavy with some curl, medium coarse, super thick dry</li>
            <li> Found a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; flat brush at the local market.  </li>
            <li> The back is sturdy, flat, and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I wash my brush when it gets linty build-up in it, usually once or twice a week, using gentle shampoo and a nail brush to scrub.  </li>

            <li> have type 2C long blonde hair which tangles in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> It smoothly detangles my hair, which is very long (to my butt), thick, coarse, frizzy, and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> just half and half I would guess, but that actually turned out okay because just boar doesn&#x27;t go through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My natural sebum is being moved down my length and is conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were too soft and did not brush down to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The overall length is about a foot long, and the brush part is about 6x4!</li>
            <li> I only use this on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Your only supposed to use it after your hair is dry and detangled.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry hair immensely.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not 100% boar bristle and they&#x27;re false advertising which is ILLEGAL.</li>
            <li> The only issue with this brush is that when you wash it, YOU MUST LET IT THOROUGHLY DRY OUT!</li>
            <li> I take a little time to brush my hair with this brush every day and it makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s just because my hair&#x27;s so thick that hardly anything can penetrate through to the scalp usually, but seriously, I spent a good four hours just sitting around brushing my hair after getting this from the post.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Performs better then a plastic or artificial BRISSLE BRUSH.</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks how I get it to grow so long.  </li>
            <li> The handle is to long.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son with long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everybody with long hair.</li>
            <li> Larger and nicer than expected</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a gabby person and my video was too long to be posted here as a review video, but feel free to look it up.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, straight, Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comb through thick hair very well</li>
            <li> As I brushed through my long hair I had to be careful that I didn&#x27;t bang the big brush into something as I brushed down.</li>
            <li> As I brushed through my long hair I had to be careful that I didn&#x27;t bang the big brush into something as I brushed down.</li>
            <li> One of the bristles has started to fray from unknown causes but doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting worse and the other bristles seem fine.  </li>
            <li> whether you want this, it&#x27;s only about $10 and works well, but the handle is not pure wood.</li>
            <li> It glides through my hair and helps to tame the frizz and work the natural oil from my roots to my tips.    </li>
            <li> I had pretty damaged hair from a bad dye job and it really does make my hair feel softer and shinier than my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Now I am left with a brush that breaks my hair due to the burned bristles.</li>
            <li> One prompter of trims for me has been when my ends start to look and feel dry</li>
            <li> we do use this brush for is styling when our hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This brush would not go through my very straight, on the thin side hair.</li>
            <li> Not only are the bristles stiff enough to function like the a comb to define the part in my hair, but it smooths my hair into place.  </li>
            <li> Not sure whether that is good or bad</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Not to hard, and not to soft!</li>
            <li> It is very very dry here in winter.  </li>
            <li> The second day I had this brush, I used it to blow dry my hair and half of the brush tips were burned!  </li>
            <li> Little too big for my use.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I had with it was that it only ran over the surface of my very thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> We use the Wet Brush for her</li>
            <li> You can then dampen the comb and go through bristles, but you cannot get the cushion wet or submerge it in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I do not use this type of brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li> This brush maintains a medium-thickness after roughly one year of use.</li>
            <li> but I expected this.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would have more scalp and hair penetration, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with my thick wavy hair sadly</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to increase natural shine in my somewhat thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, down to the small of my back.  </li>
            <li> more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say, I quite using conventional shampoo &amp; conditioner months ago (search the No &#x27;Poo method if you&#x27;re curious) and</li>
            <li> It is definitely not real boar bristle!</li>
            <li> I have 4.... 1 with thick wavy hair, 1 with thin curly hair, and two with straight hair, all of which wake up in the morning like their hair has be never been brushed!</li>
            <li> Sturdy handle and softer bristles than some of the other brushes I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have other Boars Bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid closer attention to other reviews.</li>
            <li> If you buy this brush you must have really thin hair because if you have natural  to thick hair it wont brush it, its too soft.</li>
            <li> really wanted a boar bristle paddle brush because of the benefits, but I am disappointed with this particular brush.</li>
            <li> brush has bristles that are stiff enough they will penetrate to my scalp when brushing, but not so stiff that they hurt.  </li>
            <li> This brush has bristles that are stiff enough they will penetrate to my scalp when brushing, but not so stiff that they hurt.  </li>
            <li> This brush is decently crafted but does not have the thick nylon bristles dispersed throughout the brush to get through thick hair.</li>
            <li> The other half looks like it&#x27;s probably shorter, plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> Bristles too short for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (half way down my back), very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> so i wanted to have a wide brush to gently tame my hair frizzies.</li>
            <li> Each tuft of bristles includes slightly longer, natural-colored bristles surrounded by slightly longer black bristles.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive brush and Laura&#x27;s techniques have made my hair softer, shinier, less bulky.  </li>
            <li> The bristles will not go through my medium weight slightly wavy Caucasion hair.</li>
            <li> About half of the cluster looks like boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and my cheaper smaller brush made it hard for me to hold  and brush my hair back into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Has always smelled a little odd and my dogs bark at it.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, you can not clean this brush or at least you aren&#x27;t suppose to get the cushion the bristles are attached to wet.  </li>
            <li> You have to hold a smallish section of hair taut from the head and firmly brush down for it to go through the hair and not just over it.</li>
            <li> CAN THEY MAKE IT A LITTLE STIFFER.</li>
            <li> Saying that, however, it does seem to work well when I brush my hair in segments and does seem to make my hair a little softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> It gets a little heavy during the 100-stroke regimen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even skipped it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The brush has shed a few hairs out while cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> The brush has shed a few hairs out while cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars but a few of the bristles started to come off.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This brush made it ten times worse than what my ConAir plastic bristle causes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money, it&#x27;s in the trash now</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s heavy and clunky to me.  </li>
            <li> The paddle is about one and one half inches too wide which makes it a little awkward to use  (especially with my arthritic hands).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not natural, pure crap</li>
            <li> I mistakenly assumed it was a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; size, and failed to look at the didimensions that are listed further down in details.  </li>
            <li> They hate getting their hair brushed and all of them sat there with no complaints and the hair was so shiny an soft</li>
            <li> So I bought it anyway and, of course, my hair is a little too thick for this brush.</li>
            <li> It is past hip in length, and I want it longer.  </li>
            <li> Heavy bristled brush!</li>
            <li> Weird shape and too big.</li>
            <li> The size makes it difficult for carrying (unless you have a big purse).</li>
            <li> I have used Boar brushes in the past and wonder why I stopped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I have thicker asian hair, which it can be alittle difficult to comb thru.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush base on some other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, a beauty wizard, suggested that I purchase a boar bristle hairbrush to promote a shine on my dull hair.  </li>
            <li> But I do not, I have thick hair and the bristles hardly touch the scalp.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about the bristle material after reading negative reviews.</li>
            <li> and I dont even have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, but this brush doesn&#x27;t quite make it all the way thru my hair to my scalp.</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t get through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your hair is thick at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the way through my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and this brush does not go through all the layers.</li>
            <li> I cannot even imagine how this brush would work on someone with thick</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it your hairs thick.</li>
            <li> My hairs thick, I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The wood on this is fake and flakes off, and it is not pure boar bristle,</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out like all my past brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> you buy this brush and use it regularly, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this brush and use it regularly, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t feel as if I&#x27;m being snatched bald-headed anymore!</li>
            <li> Overall, a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all for my very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Very thick bristles, gets out all the tangles without pulling my hair and helps keep my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and balding, this is like dragging a rake across my head.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, waste of money .\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I could be completely wrong on this though.      </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s relatively useless.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> However, big and clunky is not the worst feature of this brush.  </li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> and this is a bad brush</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was also very disappointed to see \\&quot;Made</li>
            <li> I brush my hair in shower, and noticed that it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> Also, after washing the brush as directed, the bristles smelled terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Every woman needs to have a boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for!  My hair is glossy and looks so much better.  I brush now every night just like in the old days.  Wonderful brush -- love it!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good brush for the price I paid for it, but I dont really like it. It really doesnt brush my hair and I dont even have thick hair. If you buy this brush you must have really thin hair because if you have natural  to thick hair it wont brush it, its too soft.</li>
            <li> Found a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; flat brush at the local market.  Should have looked there first!  Maybe there were dimensions on the web page, but I didn&#x27;t see or notice them...  My suggestion would be to maybe show something with the brush to depict the scale.  The overall length is about a foot long, and the brush part is about 6x4!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, down to the small of my back.  Everyone always asks how I get it to grow so long.  One of my secrets is this boar bristle brush!  It&#x27;s very gentle on hair, much better than yanking at knots with a hard plastic brush.  I only use this on dry hair.  The bristles are stiff and feel good on the scalp, and boar bristles help distribute oils from the scalp to the ends of your hair to keep it healthy.  I take a little time to brush my hair with this brush every day and it makes my hair soft and shiny.  Over time, it has also helped my hair grow.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my first boar bristle brush, and it is amazing. It smoothly detangles my hair, which is very long (to my butt), thick, coarse, frizzy, and slightly wavy. It makes my hair shine and look beautiful and healthy. It glides through my hair and helps to tame the frizz and work the natural oil from my roots to my tips.    The brush itself is quite beautiful. Each tuft of bristles includes slightly longer, natural-colored bristles surrounded by slightly longer black bristles. The wooden handle and back is one solid piece, and it&#x27;s a beautiful, rich color. It&#x27;s nice and heavy, which feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job to me than a light, plastic brush. The varnish gives it a beautiful shine and brings out the beauty of the wood.    I&#x27;d also like to add that if you enjoy spanking your consenting adult partner, this brush should be a perfect implement for such an activity. The smack as you land a swat will sound beautiful. The heft will give it a great \\&quot;thuddy\\&quot; sensation, and make some great bruises for you to admire later on.    For whatever purpose you purchase this brush, it is beautiful and a great value. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for just over a month, twice a day, in the bent-at-waist position between 80-100 strokes in the morning and 40-50 at night.  My normal shed rate prior to using a boar bristle brush (BBB) was 25-30 hairs a day, and on wash days I was losing 40-50 hairs.  Within two weeks it dropped to 10-15 hairs a day, and wash days I was losing 15-20 hairs.  Within a month, my shed rate dropped to 5-10 hairs a day, and wash days were 10-15 hairs.  Now it has been just over a month, and yesterday was a wash day.  I only lost 6 hairs yesterday.  This morning when I brushed, I did not lose even one hair.  NOT EVEN ONE!!!  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll lose a few when I brush tonight, but this is incredibly awesome.  I have average thickness hair (a 7.5 cm ponytail circumference), and would love it if I got another centimeter added to my circumference.  Maybe the BBB is the answer for me?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other benefits:  My hair type is 1c-F/M-ii (Google Fia&#x27;s hair typing to learn what that means).  It is past hip in length, and I want it longer.  One prompter of trims for me has been when my ends start to look and feel dry and when they split.  Since using the BBB, my hair is shinier, smoother, glossier, and more moisturized.  My natural sebum is being moved down my length and is conditioning my hair.  I am finding that I do not need near as much leave-in conditioner or as much oil applied to my length.  I&#x27;ve even skipped it a few times.  This makes it so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down, yet it is very well conditioned from my own sebum.  It is winter right now, and I have less static than I did prior to using the BBB.  This has become an indispensable tool in my hair-care arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tutorial on YouTube I uploaded showing the proper use of a BBB in he bent-at-waist position.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a gabby person and my video was too long to be posted here as a review video, but feel free to look it up.  My YouTube screen name is just my name, Laura Grout, and the video is entitled &amp;#34;How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it or you will cause damage and breakage.  A BBB is not a detangling brush.  Use a wide tooth seamless comb for detangling. Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  If you flip your hair over you will cause tangles.  There is a way to do it that minimizes tangles.  I show how to do it in my video. Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has bristles that are stiff enough they will penetrate to my scalp when brushing, but not so stiff that they hurt.  I wash my brush when it gets linty build-up in it, usually once or twice a week, using gentle shampoo and a nail brush to scrub.  The brush has shed a few hairs out while cleaning it.  This hasn&#x27;t impacted its performance thus far, but I expect I will need to replace this brush eventually.  It feels really good on my scalp.  It craves brushing every morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this brush and use it regularly, you will not be disappointed.  Curlies, your mileage may vary.  Some curlies and wavies love BBBing, and others say it&#x27;s the devil.  As a straighty, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review.itled &amp;#34;How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush.&amp;#34;  It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it or you will cause damage and breakage.

            <li> Other than making my hair a bit staticy, I think it is a nice brush.  It really redistributes the oils from the scalp to make hair smoother.</li>
            <li> If there was a zero star option, I would rate it zero star. The brush makes the static on my hair way worse! It is definitely not real boar bristle! Too bad I didn&#x27;t read all the comments before buying it. Do not waste your money on it!</li>
            <li> I am a transplant from California to far northern Minnesota.  It is very very dry here in winter.  My hair is long (half way down my back), very thick and wavy.  It was becoming especially dry and unmanageable.  I researched hairbrushes - different types and their uses on lots of websites.  And I read many hairbrush reviews.  I found this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OKpcpmeNJ48  entitled &amp;#34;How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s worth slowing yourself down and watching all the way through.  I have learned that the Spornette DeVille boar bristle paddle brush is for brushing your hair, for distributing your natural oil throughout your hair.  It is not a styling brush to be used with a blow dryer.  It is not an implement for de-tangling your hair.  I&#x27;ve been managing my hair per Laura&#x27;s video for about two weeks now.  The change in my hair is very noticeable.  This inexpensive brush and Laura&#x27;s techniques have made my hair softer, shinier, less bulky.  There&#x27;s often a bristle or two on the bathroom counter after i brush.  I don&#x27;t consider this an issue.  There is a bit of static each time i begin to brush but it dissipates after the first few brush strokes.  there&#x27;s a bonus, too, to this new regime -  the simple act of brushing each morning and evening is rather peaceful and almost meditative:)</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars but a few of the bristles started to come off.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush base on some other reviews.  Unfortunately the review that says that this brush left her hair with a lot of static was correct.  I had a head full of static.  I have fine, wavy but dense hair.  I got much better results from the Isinis hairb rush I purchased.  I just happen to really like paddle brushes this size.  I liked the look of the wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were too soft and did not brush down to my scalp.  They didn&#x27;t clean the hair as boar bristle brushes are supposed to be notorious for doing.  This brush is made in China like everything else and overall it just lacks actually quality.  If you are about to spend $15.00 on a brush it should deliver results.  This brush did not deliver the results that boar bristle brushes deliver.  Because it doesn&#x27;t brush deeply it also does not deliver that famous shine that you get from a boar bristle brush either.  Overall, a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a boar&#x27;s hair brush to help re-distribute the oils in my hair, the first few I came across were out of my price range. I ordered this brush when I saw the price, unsure if I could expect a quality product at the given price. I&#x27;m impressed. I have long, fine hair that comes to the top of my thighs &amp; while I didn&#x27;t expect this to be able to get through my hair in one stroke, it does much better than other bristle type brushes I&#x27;ve used. I have stuck to a metal peg type brush just to be able to de-tangle my hair until now. I still use that other brush, but I find myself turning to this one more &amp; more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say, I quite using conventional shampoo &amp; conditioner months ago (search the No &#x27;Poo method if you&#x27;re curious) and my hair is much easier to brush, perhaps that makes me like this brush more. However, my 14yr old son, who has shoulder length hair with much more texture &amp; curl to it (and uses conventional shampoo) says this is his favorite brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, we&#x27;re happy &amp; impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been nearly two years since I purchased this brush. I still use it regularly &amp; its still in good condition. The wood has lost some of its luster, but its still sturdy. No loose bristles at all.</li>
            <li> It works as it should and it easy to clean.  Fits nicely in my hand.  Good for gently scratching an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush distributes my natural oils so I can go days longer without washing my hair. I brush my hair at night. I put the top half of my hair up with a clip and brush the bottom first, then put it all down and brush the top part of my head, so I can reach my scalp on all parts of my head for the benefits. It feels great against my scalp and has made any trace of dandruff go away as it distributes the oils down the hair shaft. This brush (or any boar bristle brush) makes my hair extremely soft and silky. I have naturally wavy hair and while the brush sleeks it out at first, after I sleep on it, it is wavy again in the morning and the curls are much less frizzy than normal. I will never go back to a modern brush after buying this boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This Spornette brush is on it&#x27;s way back to Amazon.  The bristles will not go through my medium weight slightly wavy Caucasion hair. Bristles are too short.  I guess it would be good for smoothing top layer hair. I was also very disappointed to see \\&quot;Made In China\\&quot; emblazened on the front part of the handle right under the company name.</li>
            <li> Great product. Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very, very happy with my brush.  It really softens and smooths out my hair. I have pretty thick hair so I have to brush it in layers to really get to my scalp.  It feels GREAT on my head. I think the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t stop brushing for about 20 minutes because it just felt so amazing. I mainly ordered this brush to help distribute the natural oils of the scalp/roots down to the ends and it does a really good job. An added bonus to this brush is how great it is at smoothing!  I&#x27;ve found it very useful for getting my bangs to stay combed back and for smoothing out that hair under a ponytail.      Things to note: It doesn&#x27;t seem like the handle is actually made from wood.  But they do a decent job of pretending that it is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that 100% of the bristles in this brush are actual boar hair.  As you can tell, the brush is made from clusters of bristles.  About half of the cluster looks like boar bristles.  The other half looks like it&#x27;s probably shorter, plastic bristles.  But then again, this brush is $10 and I wasn&#x27;t expecting a luxury item.  I could be completely wrong on this though.      Also, be aware that boar bristle brushes are not detangling brushes.  The bristles are too close for that.  Use a normal, wider-toothed brush to detangle first, then indulge in a few minutes of brushing with your boar bristle brush. :)</li>
            <li> Nicely made.. Heavy bristled brush! Great for short hair!  Definitely not a plastic brush! Would be great for that guy in your life!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She also prefers to use this brush to give me a spanking</li>
            <li> What can I say about a brush? It&#x27;s well made and lives up to its description.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell when it gets wet. I brush my hair in shower, and noticed that it smelled awful. Not using it anymore. It&#x27;s not natural, pure crap</li>
            <li> Seems like the bristles might be mixed with nylon</li>
            <li> The handle is to long.</li>
            <li> The bristles arn&#x27;t strong so it just makes your hair smooth. I have thick hair and this is a bad brush</li>
            <li> Weird shape and too big. Not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other BBB, but my hair thinks this one is the best! If you do no-poo, this is a must to add to your routine!</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve come across. I have long, thick hair and it makes my hair so soft. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all for my very thick wavy hair. Can&#x27;t get tangles out, just gets tangled into my hair.</li>
            <li> Little too big for my use.  Works great, though.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush for my daughter&#x27;s. I have 4.... 1 with thick wavy hair, 1 with thin curly hair, and two with straight hair, all of which wake up in the morning like their hair has be never been brushed! They hate getting their hair brushed and all of them sat there with no complaints and the hair was so shiny an soft so glad I bought this brush!!!!</li>
            <li> Received on time and as described.</li>
            <li> The varnish keeps peeling off and I have to soak it in water with shampoo quite often because it gets stinky - the stink didn&#x27;t come from me.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my hair.  lt spread the oils evenly and conditions your hair.  l love this brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy and the brush seems to be of high quality. My hair is fine-ish and I do no-poo and this brush is so good at distributing the sebum into the lengths of my hair! Love it! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This brush is beautiful and almost the right stiffness.  I think the air in the paddle brush makes it a bit cushier than we wanted but FAR better than brushes we have found in the store.  I gave this as a gift and she really loves it.  We would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush.  It is big and sturdy and soft.  I recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, but this brush doesn&#x27;t quite make it all the way thru my hair to my scalp. Still, it feels nice when I&#x27;m brushing my hair - soft enough to not feel scratchy, big enough to cover a good area of scalp at a time.</li>
            <li> Couple things about this brush. First of all, love this brush! And second, this brush is NOT for detangling. Boar bristle brushes are not made for that purpose. Your only supposed to use it after your hair is dry and detangled. Also, the size of this brush is probably better suited for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price.  Sturdy handle and softer bristles than some of the other brushes I have purchased.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t by this. It&#x27;s too soft and makes my hair FULL of static. My 3 year old loves it because it&#x27;s gentle but she has static too</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good brush for a while and I think I found the perfect one! I don&#x27;t use shampoo any more and this brush moves the oils down my hair shaft better than any of my plastic brushes did. And it is super easy to clean.   The only draw back is the that the bristles are not really long and aren&#x27;t good at actually styling hair. I still keep my plastic brush around to comb out my hair. But I use my boar bristle brush every night to brush my hair and make it super soft.   GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Love it! Its sooo soft and leaves my hair feeling great! It also doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out like all my past brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these brushes for myself and daughters.  We all use the brushes without any issues.  Good for long hair.  Great price!</li>
            <li> The wood on this is fake and flakes off, and it is not pure boar bristle, just half and half I would guess, but that actually turned out okay because just boar doesn&#x27;t go through my thick hair. I did like the shine this gave to my hair, but the wood would occasionally flake into it. It&#x27;s up to you whether you want this, it&#x27;s only about $10 and works well, but the handle is not pure wood.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a month or so now. I had pretty damaged hair from a bad dye job and it really does make my hair feel softer and shinier than my regular brush. I also feel like I am not pulling my hair out when brushing.</li>
            <li> it feels good as i brush though my hair and keeping my waves tight. it also looks good and appears as though it is sturdy just by the quality of the manufacturing.</li>
            <li> if you are a guy with short hair, this brush is probably too big for you. I wanted one by this company I wish I would have got a smaller size. But it is constructed well and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would have more scalp and hair penetration, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with my thick wavy hair sadly</li>
            <li> This hair brush arrived very fast and the brush itself suits my needs. This is a truly wonderful hairbrush. It is strong but soft to the hair. I rate this brush AAAA plus in price and performance .</li>
            <li> This brush feels great on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull and gives me a shiny finish...love it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice brush but it can&#x27;t get through my thick hair. I tried brushing it multiple ways and in the end, there are still tangles I have to get out with another brush. Luckily, the price was low so I&#x27;m not out much money but it&#x27;s relatively useless. Additionally, it causes so much static. I have tried using hair spray and rubbing a dryer sheet on it but relief is only temporary. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your hair is thick at all.</li>
            <li> Great hair brush and works well with blow drying too</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I need for my hair. My hair is so thick and coarse. I needed this so I could brush my locks completely thru.</li>
            <li> This is good if you don&#x27;t need to get out serious tangles. It&#x27;s perfect for my 5 year old daughters hair as it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It&#x27;s very gentle-but it doesn&#x27;t work for my older daughters thick hair. We use the Wet Brush for her</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to increase natural shine in my somewhat thick wavy hair. For some reason this brush does not even &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; my hair. It cannot even reach the roots of my hair...it cannot grasp or hold my hair. Would have returned</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than what you imagine when you look at the picture, so read the specs before you order it. That being said, I am very satisfied with this purchase. I did not have bristles fall out, as some have complained.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a very short flat top, and this keeps my hair up straight in front.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Combs, brushes and messages, all at the same time.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter likes the brush very much. I doesn&#x27;t hurt when her mom brushes her hair. My grand daughter is 3.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my wife and she uses it all the time.  I didn&#x27;t know the quality of a brush would make such a difference with how hair feels, but it does.</li>
            <li> Great brush for flat brushing the hair when drying very thick/coarse hair.  The hair is so shiny and soft when using this brush as a drying aid.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% genuine boar bristle.  The bristles melted the first time I used it with my hair dryer.  I would not recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is sooo sweet! I love it so much! It&#x27;s so smooth when it brushes my hair. I get a better groom with this brush. Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> This is NOT boar hair, i assure you!  It is some form of synthetic.  Do not waste your time and money.  I bought this because my hair is static ridden during the winter, and heard natural hair brushes help with that.  This brush made it ten times worse than what my ConAir plastic bristle causes.  Simply Unusable.&lt;br /&gt;It was in the trash five minutes after opening it, but i decided to return it considering it was over 20 dollars with tax and shipping.</li>
            <li> A great brush, just bigger than I expected.....check your dimensions! My own fault, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4 and not a 5</li>
            <li> this brush is nice, not too harsh on hair, good quality and nice size. Quality wood and easy on the hand.</li>
            <li> The reviews loved this, but I have to say it is not for anyone with short hair. It is great for longer and long hair, but anything that resembles a man&#x27;s cut seems a torture (if used extensively).</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m caucasian &amp; my hair is nearly to my waist and naturally wavy.  I don&#x27;t feel this brush is for getting tangles out.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the way through my thick hair.  But what it&#x27;s really good for is just brushing.  I can feel it gently on my scalp, kinda like a massage.  This brush is good for distributing the natural oils in your scalp down to the ends of your hair.  Another big plus is that I use this when I want to wear my hair up.  This will smooth your hair right to your head with none of those little hairs sticking up.  I use different  brushes but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush.  Not great, but good.  I bought this one to replace my favorite brush that broke.  After an exhaustive search of the Internet, this one was the closest I could find.      THis one does the job - I have thick, curly hair and am able to blow it straight every day.  But it would be better if the bristles were a little longer and there was a comfortable grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> I have a favorite hair brush that I have owned for 30 years.  It was a quality brush with stiff nylon bristles, so it was excellent for managing my short hair.  Problem is that eventually bristles fall out of any good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a quality replacement for several years.  The stores where I shop just do not carry what I need.  So I searched on Amazon.  I found hundreds of choices and selected the Spornette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Spornette Deville 100% Boar Bristle Paddle Brush\\&quot; is good enough for me.  Not only are the bristles stiff enough to function like the a comb to define the part in my hair, but it smooths my hair into place.  After a good brushing, my hair is actually more luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this brush is that the \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; is a bit large.  The paddle is about one and one half inches too wide which makes it a little awkward to use  (especially with my arthritic hands).  If the makers reduced the  paddle by a third it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years and it&#x27;s held up well. It replaced a very old bristle brush that was worn out. As mentioned, it&#x27;s large and somewhat heavy, but works well for my fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush, but do not expect miracles in your hair. Some of boar bristle brushes are sold for 95.00, which I think it is an insult. This one will do the same work.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. It is a really good quality brush and feels great on the scalp too.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it did before. I also have been able to go longer between shampooing!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s very gentle on my thinning hair. I gently comb out tangles with a wide-toothed comb and then brush my hair in sections with the boar bristle brush because, as others have said, this brush is too soft to penetrate to the scalp. I also followed the advice of others by refraining to use the brush with a blowdryer. In fact, I&#x27;ve quit blowdrying my hair altogether to minimize breakage. The boar bristle brush is great for women who are trying to grow long, undamaged hair.</li>
            <li> works great on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hair extensions. Excellent, nicely made great quality brush -- surprising for the price. I was a bit concerned about the bristle material after reading negative reviews. It states 100% boar bristle on the label, and also on the brush handle. I have another boar bristle brush brought from Germany and more expensive, and the bristles on both brushes appear and feel the same. They did not melt when I was using my hair dryer. The brush does not give me any statics. I don&#x27;t have a reason to suspect it is not a real boar bristle; but even if it isn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t care &#x3D;)! This is the best-feeling brush ever.</li>
            <li> CAN THEY MAKE IT A LITTLE STIFFER.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush is a miracle. Before you go thinking I&#x27;m exaggerating, I&#x27;ll tell you I&#x27;m DEFINITELY not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairbrush is incredibly well-made. It is made of real wood and real boar bristles (unlike some other products I have received from amazon...), and feels amazingly sturdy, even when I brush through my thick, unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of redistributing hair oils and taming frizz, you probably already knew that, but my biggest love for this brush is how it feels on the scalp. It feels incredible. Maybe that&#x27;s just because my hair&#x27;s so thick that hardly anything can penetrate through to the scalp usually, but seriously, I spent a good four hours just sitting around brushing my hair after getting this from the post.&lt;br /&gt;I have type 2C long blonde hair which tangles in a heartbeat. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;d hold up on curlier hair types (and it might be a little too much for very fine hair to handle) but it seems like this brush is almost without flaw.&lt;br /&gt;The handle, too, is shaped so that it is easy to hold, but that&#x27;s not really uncommon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the brush was the strong plastic smell that it had when it was first unpackaged. It quickly wore off but was very offputting, and I nearly assumed it was a fake from the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this is a beautiful brush, and for the price, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, a perfect birthday gift. It replaced a very old brush that was many years old.</li>
            <li> This brush was made well and I like but it is to soft for me. The only reason why it does not have 5 stars is what I stated (too soft)</li>
            <li> The brush appears to work great. The bristles appear to be fragile in that I could easily pull them from the paddle, but it isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip out as many of my long, admittedly thinning, gray hairs. At least I don&#x27;t feel as if I&#x27;m being snatched bald-headed anymore! Don&#x27;t forget the rule of always starting at the bottom to remove tangles and use your fingers to separate knots. After the tangles are removed I can brush from the top of head to the bottom, distributing oils to ends just like they told us to do in the old days; although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing 100 strokes, ha ha.</li>
            <li> On Time Delivery. Nice brush, does the job.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift mom loved it</li>
            <li> great brush, soft and feels so good on the scalp.  It flattens my hair, so I only brush before I wash.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this brush not being good for thick hair so I knew what I was getting myself into. However, I really was interested in this brush because of the overall good reviews and cheap price and so talked myself into thinking that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick as the people who said it didn&#x27;t work for them.... maybe my hair was more of a medium thick? Eh? So I bought it anyway and, of course, my hair is a little too thick for this brush. Saying that, however, it does seem to work well when I brush my hair in segments and does seem to make my hair a little softer and shinier. I think because I&#x27;m pressing down so hard in an effort to have the bristles reach my scalp, it flattens my hair more than I&#x27;d like, although I guess some people make call this &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;. Overall, I&#x27;d say this would be a great brush for those who have normal, less thick hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would be sturdy enough for some over-the-knee spanking... Was not disappointed; works fantastic and has held up.  I recommend it to any sadists needing a new toy for the toy bag.</li>
            <li> They melted right away as I was blow drying my hair. False advertising! Don&#x27;t waste you money, it&#x27;s in the trash now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s boar bristle.....it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> probably the best around</li>
            <li> I have other Boars Bristle brushes.  ALL are softer than this one.  Not sure whether that is good or bad so I grit my teeth and use it daily.  It does the job but not without irritation.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL AND YOUR HAIR WILL LOVE IT.  MAKES YOUR HAIR SHINNY WHEN YOU BRUSH IT.  THE BOAR BRISTLES ARE GOOD FOR YOUR SCALP AND MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW WITHOUT PULLING OUT YOUR HAIR LIKE OTHER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome and does what I wanted it to do. Only thing is the finish on the brush after disinfecting it in a salon is starting to chip off. The whole back is gone now</li>
            <li> Great paddle brush! Has always smelled a little odd and my dogs bark at it. :P I think it&#x27;s because of the boar bristles. I&#x27;ve had this over a year and it&#x27;s held up very nicely.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comb through thick hair very well</li>
            <li> So in love. Make sure to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter came to visit,,,and we brushed her hair with my old boar&#x27;s hair brush and she loved it...so I bought two of these, one for each of us...now she keeps her tresses looking neat and shiny.  I like mine too!</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Performs better then a plastic or artificial BRISSLE BRUSH.</li>
            <li> I bought this strictly to use on my beard which is about 6&amp;#34; in length and very coarse and curly. I have the smaller 2 sided brush that is very popular on here. It was great at shorter length, but I need the full width of this paddle to properly brush myself without the hair getting caught on the other side. I love the consistency of the bristles. It makes my beard nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My girlfriend is growing her hair longer and likes how the brush works.</li>
            <li> The second day I had this brush, I used it to blow dry my hair and half of the brush tips were burned!  Now I am left with a brush that breaks my hair due to the burned bristles.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and this brush does not go through all the layers. I can do it in layers but it takes so much longer I end up just using a different brush.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long hair.  It&#x27;s not so much for getting out tangles but does a great job smoothing and brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter, a beauty wizard, suggested that I purchase a boar bristle hairbrush to promote a shine on my dull hair.  I was hesitate about using animal products, I thought my hair would smell like pig and my dogs would try to eat the brush or myself.  The bamboo handle is awesome.  I&#x27;ve used this brush many times and have never had a problem with tangling, it&#x27;s gentle to release knots.&lt;br /&gt;The price from the seller was wonderful, less than $20 and I believe I was able to purchase other items from Amazon to qualify for free shipping.  So all around an awesome deal and now I have shiny healthy looking hair that professional hair stylists have commented on.</li>
            <li> I saw in a magazine that boar bristle reduces frizz. The brush they were advertising was like $60. I ordered this brush and it does make my hair much smoother.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this brush but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I should have paid closer attention to other reviews. I have thinning hair so was sure it would be ok for my hair. I was wrong. It does not reach my scalp either. For a brush to be able to spread the natural oils in your hair, it must reach the scalp where their located. This one doesn&#x27;t. It is soft, very soft on my long,long hair. However,I need a brush to be both good for my hair and my scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent product. I have been using for more than a year with no loss in quality.</li>
            <li> I bought two styles of paddle brushes for my husband and he likes them both.  Priced very reasonably and the bristles are of good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush. IT works great on my hair. My hair is fine, but curly. So this works great to leave long locks of curls.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked the brush.  I thought it was a little large. It looks like it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> My husband after YEARS of having his favorite brush had to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;This is bigger and better than his last one. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> As described.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the bristles, but they could be longer to reach to my scalp. But, it is very kind to my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  a bit bigger than I was looking for but I use it!</li>
            <li> Using this brush has helped with my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I recently had all my hair cut off and needed a good brush.  It&#x27;s so short that I don&#x27;t even need a comb anymore.  I love this brush.  I like how it feels when I brush my hair, it stimulates my scalp, and makes my air look so shiny and wavy after I use it.  It has a beautiful wooden handle and is very well constructed.  I can&#x27;t believe that they&#x27;re selling this brush for such a low price.  I&#x27;d pay more for it.  It&#x27;s just that good.  For anyone who wears very short hair, and is looking for a great hairbrush, and they don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg, this would be a wise purchase.  I understand that Mason Pearson is the \\&quot;Rolls Royce\\&quot; for boar hair bristle hairbrushes, but they can cost close to one hundred and up to two hundred dollars.  The length of my hair would not warrant that kind of expense.</li>
            <li> I have hip-length, very straight, fine, medium thick normal hair. My daughter has hair to the middle of her back, wavy with some curl, medium coarse, super thick dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t ever detangle using a boar bristle brush. We get tangles out using a wide-toothed pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we do use this brush for is styling when our hair is dry. It leaves both of us with very shiny, very smooth hair. We clean the brush once a month with shampoo, and comb it out quickly after every use over the sink. This has kept it in great shape. Neither of us use hair products, so if you do use mousses, gels, etc, you may want to wash your brush more often, possibly with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to help blend my real hair into my clip in hair extensions when I wear them straight. It does an amazing job. The brush is a good quality. I would and have recommended this brush to friends.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush and opened it, my husband remarked about how big it was.  Yeah, I said it&#x27;s a paddle brush and they&#x27;re bigger.  Actually, this is a big brush.  The paddle is about 3 by 5 inches.  I&#x27;ll try to add photos with a ruler after I finish this writing.  Not only is it big, it&#x27;s heavy and clunky to me.  However, big and clunky is not the worst feature of this brush.  As other reviews have said, you can not clean this brush or at least you aren&#x27;t suppose to get the cushion the bristles are attached to wet.  Silly me, I didn&#x27;t really believe they would sell a hair brush you could not clean.  After buying the brush I sent email to the manufacturer asking how this brush should be cleaned.  The following is the email I received back from Spornette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subject: SPORNETTE #344 BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Apr 2011 11:30:49 -0500&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Dee,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your email regarding the best way to clean the #344 brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We suggest that you only run a comb from the bottom of the bristles to the top to remove any excess hair.  You can then dampen the comb and go through bristles, but you cannot get the cushion wet or submerge it in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for supporting Spornette International.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spornette Customer Service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I still kept the brush and didn&#x27;t return it even after this answer.  I had really been wanting to see if a natural bristle brush would make any difference with the frizziness of my long naturally wavy hair.  It was ok but I can&#x27;t say that it did that much for it and I found myself not wanting to use the brush unless my hair had just been washed since I didn&#x27;t feel like I could really get it clean.  Of course the whole idea of a natural bristle brush is to condition your hair by distributing your natural hair oil throughout the length of your hair and when it is first washed there isn&#x27;t much, if any, natural oil to distribute.  I did think the bristles were stiff enough that it did feel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  As I brushed through my long hair I had to be careful that I didn&#x27;t bang the big brush into something as I brushed down. E.G. the vanity top.  The one thing that helped me use this brush for a year is that I found a wonderful brush cleaner by the Fuller Brush company.  I see that they now have several of their products on Amazon now and I&#x27;m hoping they will eventually add their hairbrush cleaner.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been replacing all my hairbrushes with ones made by Fuller, which are made in the USA.  They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo &amp; water. Fuller also has wood handle hair brushes if you prefer wood.  This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush.eel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.

            <li> Bought this for my son with long hair.  This pulls out the snags and matting with no tears or complaints.  Super happy it was recommended by a friend!</li>
            <li> This brushes the top of my hair but not underneath. It is very thick bristle and it is 100% boar, but I liked the other spornette I bought better.</li>
            <li> I think it works great for fine hair to add shine and distribute oils, i use it to dry my hair and its super soft. i also use it on my extensions, but definatly not a styling brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it makes my hair softer, distributes my natural hair olis throughout my hair, feels great on my head when I brush, Overall Wonderful, no problems</li>
            <li> The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out, bent, or loosened. The back is sturdy, flat, and lightweight. The size makes it difficult for carrying (unless you have a big purse). The grip on this fits my (smallish) hand perfectly and never slips while I am working.</li>
            <li> Spornette DeVille 100% Boar Bristle Paddle Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted a boar bristle paddle brush because of the benefits, but I am disappointed with this particular brush. I have normal hair (not thick), yet the bristles do not even reach my scalp, which is the reason I bought it. In fact, I have never encountered a problem like this with a hair brush, so it was not something I even considered. Maybe the brush has  too many bristles. I cannot even imagine how this brush would work on someone with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to buy a more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH! Not to hard, and not to soft! Wears VERY well, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> This brush is great!  I have had it for about 6 months. My daughter no longer cries tmwhen it time to brush her hair. She actually asks me to brush her hair. A great brush for parents and kids alike.</li>
            <li> The brush is very well constructed and a good product.  I gave it as a gift for someone that wanted to try boar bristles and she really does love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush, kind of large though.</li>
            <li> love love love this brush. Its amazing. Makes my hair so shiny and soft. I do hair and love bore brushes.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for- a brush that would spread out my hair&#x27;s natural oils from root to end. The bristles are very sturdy, but comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t damage or break my hairs at all. The entire brush is also very well constructed. I do have to detangle my hair first, but I don&#x27;t mind and I think this brush does a great job of keep my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> great brush, i have thick long curly hair and tames my my wild mess</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hairbrush, very solid and feels great. i expect it will provide many years of excellent service.</li>
            <li> Good design. Perfect for me, but there&#x27;s no accounting for taste (or hair composition.) At first I thought it would be too big, but it is not. Good feel in the hand, good balance, and the bristles are perfect - stiff but not brusque. I leave it on the bathroom counter, and it makes a very nice decorative item, plus it&#x27;s handy to use whilst galloping past the mirror.</li>
            <li> This brush is huge, at least for men. And the bristles are not the quality soft ones that I loved about my old brush. I have thin hair and balding, this is like dragging a rake across my head.  I was looking for a rectangular brush, maybe 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, no big &#x27;handle&#x27; , with soft quality bristles.  This is the opposite.  If you are male, or you have fine hair, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This brush is decently crafted but does not have the thick nylon bristles dispersed throughout the brush to get through thick hair. It says &amp;#34;China&amp;#34; on the handle too, which looks a bit tacky.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, feels good looks good everybody should grow a beard because that&#x27;s what you should do.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sturdy bristles, and easy to handle. Checked many brushes and felt this was more expensive but worth the money. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really good brush. I have long hair so i wanted to have a wide brush to gently tame my hair frizzies. The wooden handle is great, hand the brush does perfectly the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to help me with my transitioning hair after giving up shampoo. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. However, it is incredibly soft and feels lovely against your scalp. I have long, thick, straight, Caucasian hair. This brush might be more useful for those with very fine or even curly hair.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this for just brushing the top of my hair, my hair is too thick to use this to detangle, but my roommate has one that she uses on her thinner hair just fine. Very well made.</li>
            <li> This brush puts such an amazing glossy look to my hair, I love it.  I&#x27;m buying another one for my purse.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I use this after i go threw my hair with a regular brush. It really helps smooth and spread out my natural oils</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent! I have used Boar brushes in the past and wonder why I stopped. After a few days of using this brush I noticed that I was not seeing as many fly aways. The ends of my hair is also smoother. The only issue with this brush is that when you wash it, YOU MUST LET IT THOROUGHLY DRY OUT! If you do not your hair will smell like a pig sty. This is the most common issue people do not understand about Boar brushes. Overall, this brush is excellent and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> From the picture, one cannot determine the size of this hairbrush.  I mistakenly assumed it was a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; size, and failed to look at the didimensions that are listed further down in details.  Size is 10 x 3.5 x 2 inches.  Weight is 5.6 ounces.  This is one hefty brush.  If that is what you really want, then this brush may be a great purchase.  I was expecting something of a more manageable size.  I&#x27;m returning these to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three star rating represents a combo of good and poor features:  quality look and construction, gigantic size and weight.</li>
            <li> This is a good boar bristle brush overall, with one main flaw. The handle is a lovely color and feels nice to hold, not too heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The one problem I had with it was that it only ran over the surface of my very thick, naturally curly hair. You have to hold a smallish section of hair taut from the head and firmly brush down for it to go through the hair and not just over it. It is reasonably priced, so basically you get what you pay for. Other than that, I felt this was an okay investment and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Bristles too short for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> my husband has been looking for this type brush for a long time great buy love it, would buy again</li>
            <li> What can I say about this brush besides the fact that I love it. My last hair brush was a cheap brush I brought from a grocery store for $5. I used that brush for years until my hair started to out grow it.  I am African American with 3c curly type natural hair to the middle of my back. My hair is very thick and my cheaper smaller brush made it hard for me to hold  and brush my hair back into a ponytail. With this brush I brush my hair so much faster. While also making my curls pop!! I never knew your choice of brush was so important but now that I know I won&#x27;t go back.  It&#x27;s light weight and not heavy at all. It does it&#x27;s job very well !</li>
            <li> I read in a hair care book that boar bristle brushes would be good for maintaining healthy hair. It was suppose to stimulate growth and maintain sheen. I haven&#x27;t seen these results specifically from the brush. However, it does cause static electricity in my hair. Also, after washing the brush as directed, the bristles smelled terrible. I guess it&#x27;s truly from a boar! It&#x27;s a sturdy brush with a very nice wood handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister. She still has the product and truly loves to use it. Its a great brush!!</li>
            <li> Got this brush because my stylest said to get one for my oily hair. Makes my hair a little static but I love it.</li>
            <li> A bit too soft for my liking. Need to brush first with the Olivia mix bristle and boar brush.</li>
            <li> This brush would not go through my very straight, on the thin side hair. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> This goes through my hair easily.  I do not use this type of brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li> The hairbrush is a very good quality product, brush perfectly my hair without damaging it. I would recommend this product to everybody with long hair.</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly STURDY brush. I love that it&#x27;s large and just amazing. feels a bit like acrylic bristles as it makes my hair incredibly frizzy... running my hands through it after I brush brings it back down to normal though. but I have frizzy hair on a good day. it does help incredibly with getting my natural hair oils spread throughout my hair. I started using this brush because I bought NaturOli soapnut shampoo, which also helps with leaving natural hair oils in. Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> Ultimate stress relieving brush. Be sure to remember how to order another one if someone &amp;#34;borrows yours&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting in a brush.  Makes my hair very static-y and does not brush out knots.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty nice, except I have thick hair, and the bristles don&#x27;t reach my scalp the way I would like.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush.  Have used it 4 days and already notice a difference in the softness and shine as opposed to a regular plastic bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not 100% boar bristle and they&#x27;re false advertising which is ILLEGAL. Some of the bristles aren&#x27;t like the others, and there does seem to be actual boar bristle in here, but the brush I used to have that was genuine worked a lot better and got through my thick hair. This barely gets through my hair and the bristles that are plastic cause my hair to get static frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall pretty disappointed. I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush is great for smoothing my frizzies, or after I flat iron my hair. My hair retains its shine, and my baby hairs lay down better after using this brush. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice if you have thin hair.  But I do not, I have thick hair and the bristles hardly touch the scalp.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s big but it feels great on the scalp and it&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li> Super-fast delivery. Everything just as presented!</li>
            <li> Feels great brushing through my hair and scalp. Definitely great for freezy long hair gals. However, I have thicker asian hair, which it can be alittle difficult to comb thru. But non the less it&#x27;s a great sturdy brush!</li>
            <li> MY daughter got caught using my brush. I said, &amp;#34;Pooh Baby (20 yr old)...now Momi got some brushes you can use, maybe even have. But this is not one of &#x27;em&amp;#34;. I absolutely love this brush. The bristles are a soft/stiff combo that surprisingly is great for my thick shoulder-length hair. It gets a little heavy during the 100-stroke regimen but I love it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;New Dec. 10, 2015 Review...I cut most of my hair off May 01, 2015. Been doing a 100 stroke for 2 months, 2-3 times a week. I did not use much with shorter hair. But I get compliments on the shine, quick growing length, and healthy hair I now possess. Again, anyway. This brush maintains a medium-thickness after roughly one year of use. I highly recommend. However, I do wish the bristles were longer. So I part my hair to brush in sections. Fine by me. Love it forever!</li>
            <li> I could have sworn the description shown on Amazon said this brush was combination nylon and boar bristle.  Its not.  Maybe I misread.  The brush wouldn&#x27;t even go through my hair it was so wimpy, and I have fine hair.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> great quality.  Larger and nicer than expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a boar bristle brush before, but the quality seems decent.  One of the bristles has started to fray from unknown causes but doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting worse and the other bristles seem fine.  Good sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product</li>
            <li> The best hair brush I ever had, and I am 66 years old.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it your hairs thick. My salon uses boar&#x27;s hair brushes. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. What a disappointment! My hairs thick, I have a lot of hair. This type of brush is great for smoothing hair, but this brush doesn&#x27;t even brush thru my hair. Can&#x27;t use&lt;br /&gt;it. Too bad, waste of money .\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price, leaves hair smooth, silky and soft! Great alternative to Mason, also I like the quality of its handle, lovely wood and very sturdy! Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I use moroccan oil in my hair and then brush it through with this brush and it spreads it through my hair just perfect!  In the winter, it does cause a lot of static but I expected this.  Very good quality and a great handle.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush. It has helped my dry hair immensely. It did initially make my hair a bit static-y but I used it to brush in some leave in conditioner and that seemed to help. I have since grown to love how soft it is when combing out my hair wet or dry. I use a tiny bit of styling oil and that tames any fly away hair as well. I won&#x27;t be without a boar bristle brush ever again!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush.  Very thick bristles, gets out all the tangles without pulling my hair and helps keep my hair shiny.  Boar bristle hairbrush is the best to use for keeping your hair shiny and healthy.  Use it daily.  It helps to distribute the natural oils on your hair and keeps its healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I plucked a bristle and burned it, it curled and smelled like hair, the product is real, and works really well for distributing the natural oils from your scalp.  It&#x27;s a fine brush for the price.  Also, it&#x27;s not too large it&#x27;s just a normal paddle brush size.</li>
