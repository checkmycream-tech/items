            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for spring and goes on so easily.</li>

            <li>But it&#x27;s too warm colored for summer...</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and we love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love my essie nail polishes!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I love Essie and just had to have this color - I would recommend both Essie and this color to anybody.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Out of the 3 I like this one the most</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more neutral than neon (MCA)...</li>
            <li>but I love Essie&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li>I would also say that you could do just one coat, but it looks better with two.</li>
            <li>I tried in on a nail and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a favorite already, This happy Essie gal highly recommends this one!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color</li>
            <li>Great color - last about a week without chipping - cute shinny finish</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>and they came within a few days &amp; were packaged perfectly</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this color on Amazon after I realized it was a \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot; color and could not be purchased in store (or on Essie&#x27;s website I believe).</li>
            <li>This shop is the one to get your favorite or even new nail polish from!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cute color, I love it.</li>
            <li>Bought it here, Shipped quick.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light with a crisp turquoise twist.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, and the delivery was fast and tracking was available.</li>
            <li>I am wearing it right now</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I just recently discovered I could buy Essie polish for super cheap online!</li>
            <li>It arrived before the shipping date and was exactly the product I purchased.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and is what is pictured.</li>
            <li>Wheres my chauffeur is such a pretty color!!!</li>
            <li>No more buying Essie at Target for me - and thats really saying something because I really love my Target!!</li>
            <li>This is the first nail polish I could put on my fingernails and it last a full week!</li>
            <li>This shade is totally 60&#x27;s &amp; funky cool!</li>
            <li>Really like this color a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more pastel minty green color.</li>
            <li>I liked this color a lot but in comparison to my other Essie polishes this one chipped a lot sooner than any of the other colors.</li>
            <li>Slightly darker than Mint Candy Apple - this hue of blue wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for, however, it is a very pretty shade.  </li>
            <li>I really like this color, though the polish is a bit on the extra viscous side.</li>
            <li>Very similar to the color \\&quot;Turquoise &amp; Caicos\\&quot;, but definitely more blue than green.</li>

            <li> The color was exactly the right color, compared to some where you get a bad formula.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected also.</li>
            <li> It is going to be empty by the end of spring!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and 2 other mint green colors.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with not only this polish</li>
            <li> However, I purchased a few online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since I have received it!</li>
            <li> Though, you need to put on at least 2-3 coats for the color to intensify.</li>
            <li> I mean you have to do layer after layer</li>
            <li> I am very tough on my hands and wash them often, if you have this problem then Essie is the solution!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so annoying</li>

            <li> Glad I found this color. I love it! I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since I have received it! Good job amazon!</li>
            <li> Multiple people have stopped me on the street or while in class about what this color is. It&#x27;s lovely. I love Essie and just had to have this color - I would recommend both Essie and this color to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail polish I could put on my fingernails and it last a full week! I am very tough on my hands and wash them often, if you have this problem then Essie is the solution! Came faster than expected also.</li>
            <li> Its Essie!! Love the color!!</li>
            <li> Love the color. I ordered this and 2 other mint green colors. Out of the 3 I like this one the most</li>
            <li> I love this color!! It&#x27;s perfect for spring and goes on so easily. I go through a lot of nail polish and this brand seems to stay on the longest without too much chipping from everyday use.</li>
            <li> Slightly darker than Mint Candy Apple - this hue of blue wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for, however, it is a very pretty shade.  It&#x27;s more neutral than neon (MCA)...And it takes about 3 or 4 coats to see actual bottle color results, so the formula was a bit runny.  I&#x27;ve kept it for winter wear.  But it&#x27;s too warm colored for summer...</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and the delivery was fast and tracking was available. The color was exactly the right color, compared to some where you get a bad formula. So happy I got this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great color. I am wearing it right now and I am in love with the shade! It also looks great with a gold accent!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s such a cute color, I love it. The only thing wrong with not only this polish but Essie is that it&#x27;s so runny, I mean you have to do layer after layer it&#x27;s so annoying but I love Essie&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li> Love love love my essie nail polishes! Wheres my chauffeur is such a pretty color!!! Definately a geat add to my collection</li>
            <li> The color is great and it is fairly durable as well. I would also say that you could do just one coat, but it looks better with two.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Sa this coolr on someone else and had to get it.  Bought it here, Shipped quick.  Really like this color a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it goes great for the summer. It arrived very quickly. Though, you need to put on at least 2-3 coats for the color to intensify.</li>

            <li> Got lots of complements on this color.  Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> This shade is totally 60&#x27;s &amp; funky cool! It is going to be empty by the end of spring! I tried in on a nail and fell in love with it.

            <li> I just recently discovered I could buy Essie polish for super cheap online! I&#x27;ve always been picky about purchasing them at Target because they are a bit on the pricey side. However, I purchased a few online and they came within a few days &amp; were packaged perfectly so they wouldn&#x27;t break! I absolutely love the color and I will defiantly be purchasing more colors! No more buying Essie at Target for me - and thats really saying something because I really love my Target!!</li>
            <li> I really like this color, though the polish is a bit on the extra viscous side.</li>
            <li> I liked this color a lot but in comparison to my other Essie polishes this one chipped a lot sooner than any of the other colors. It also took me about three coats to get the color just right. I liked it but wouldn&#x27;t say I loved it I was looking for a more pastel minty green color.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this color on Amazon after I realized it was a \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot; color and could not be purchased in store (or on Essie&#x27;s website I believe). Not to mention, it was likely cheaper than buying in store! Very similar to the color \\&quot;Turquoise &amp; Caicos\\&quot;, but definitely more blue than green. The picture provided is definiitely the color that you get. Haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it on my nails yet, but it will be a perfect color for spring, summer, or winter :)</li>
