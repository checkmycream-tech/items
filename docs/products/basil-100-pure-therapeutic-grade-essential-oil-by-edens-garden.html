            <li>Oil seems good quality....</li>
            <li>This Basil is a wonderful, sweet oil.</li>
            <li>Basil isn&#x27;t the best smelling of essential oils in my opinion, but Eden&#x27;s Garden always has the best quality.</li>
            <li>I like blending with Frankincense and Grapefruit for a very refreshing smell throughout the house.  </li>
            <li>Very potent.</li>
            <li>So I m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It would be awesome if it smelled just like fresh cut basil</li>
            <li>Tried others… This brand is GREAT Quality but MUCH cheeper!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more oils from them!</li>
            <li>I use this for liver function, plus the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am using it to create my own oil blends.</li>
            <li>I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I like to make my own lotions.</li>
            <li>Nice oil.</li>
            <li>It will do nicely in my soap making process.  </li>
            <li>It  also have a very strong basil smell...</li>
            <li>Amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li>True, it was because I was expecting the smell that one gets when they cut fresh basil leaves when preparing a delicious meal in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>Hence this oil doesn&#x27;t have a great first impression, but give it a chance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more of a burnt smell, as if you put the basil on the stove and it caught on fire.&lt;br /&gt;While not my favorite oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;pungent and burnt smelling, more like a smoldering log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am in love with the quality of this brand.  </li>
            <li>This worked better than vics vapor rub for my kids</li>
            <li>it helped them breath alot better and relieve them from congestion at night</li>
            <li>I do love it.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the oils, the product information booklet and the packaging.</li>
            <li>and I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Essential oils at a great price!!!  </li>
            <li>basil but my experience is more like &amp;#34;toasted.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>but i should have payed better attention to the description and review.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put in the ear. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product and all the others that I have ordered from this person.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.</li>
            <li>i have this oil and most of the others by this brand</li>
            <li>and i love them all and recommend them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already said - this is a good trader with good products and I will be coming back for sure.</li>
            <li>Basil is a wonderful addition to many perfume blends, it is said to work as a brain and memory stimulant and soothes stress, depression, and mental</li>
            <li>Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>EG has, so far, delivered great oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful :)</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product, is that after the bitter strong scent, the basil-ee smell that most people love will linger in your nose afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine quality, and just a hint of anise.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>Since I love the smell of fresh basil and use it a lot in cooking I was hoping to duplicate that in this oil</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, they were on time, cute packaging, and sent me a leaflet with useful info on how to use the oils</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>my favorites so far (herb-type wise) are basil, rosemary and tea tree.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique and inviting.  </li>
            <li>very clean strong scent, really like this oil.</li>
            <li>i thought it was overwhelming and much richer and harsher than what i think of as the smell of basil.</li>
            <li>ARRIVED QUICKLY AND JUST AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>great product, as expected, high quality, use in a lot of products i&#x27;ve made, will do business again!</li>
            <li>I thought that this scent smelled best when paired with lemon verbena and other citrus scented essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had, this oil alleviated my sinus congestion and ear ache, seems pure and high grade.</li>
            <li>The essential oils from Eden&#x27;s garden are by far the most effective and pure oils I have found yet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charm in it&#x27;s own strange way.</li>
            <li>THE SCENT IS PURE AND NATURAL AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE TO USE FOR AROMA THERAPY.</li>
            <li>Received my order quickly and it was packaged very well to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely more deep and smokey than fresh cut.  </li>
            <li>If you want that kind of sweet, light smell right from the bottle, it&#x27;s not gonna happen in this one-not at first at least.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of oil</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy most of my essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but not basil.</li>
            <li>This oil is potent from the moment you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the smell of fresh cut basil</li>
            <li>Will be getting more oils from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>this has a very strong bitter sent.</li>
            <li>I found that this one is a great scent when just a little is mixed with spearmint or peppermint.  </li>
            <li>You know, the wafty much sweeter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
            <li>and it really did help my neck pain.  </li>
            <li>They also deliver in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>smells really</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The oil has a fresh, clean scent very similar to actual basil leaves.</li>
            <li>It has spiritual and Magical properties...don&#x27;t quote me on this word, it is listed as a possible benifit.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>Really really bitter and strong smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>Very gender neutral unisex aroma in my opinion, floral enough for a woman&#x27;s perfume and smokey/earthy enough to compliment a more masculine blend.</li>
            <li>not the light herbal sent I expected.</li>
            <li>I still do find that this will work it&#x27;s magic the same as all my essential oils and in particular this one does linger after the oil warmer candle goes out and the house smells devine the next day after burning this.  </li>
            <li>So while it doesn&#x27;t move me like my other essential oils, it does have a strange way of lingering afterwards and becoming much more delightful the next day, with a faint crisp green outdoors scent that I notice when I come in the front</li>
            <li>Basil 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 10 ml</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exploring scents, and this is probably my least favorite that I&#x27;ve experimented with so far.</li>
            <li>Products arrived early and were packed well.</li>
            <li>Definitely can burn if you use too much at a time.</li>
            <li>Next bath I was careful and only put in 2 drops, much better.</li>
            <li>I will always come back to reorder it, for me any my whole family and my relative too...</li>
            <li>I bought Basil (along with a ton of other essential oils) to add to my hair concoctions and thats exactly what it did.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than other oils.</li>
            <li>According to Essential Oil Safety by Tisserand and Young, this is potentially carcinogenic.  </li>
            <li>The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>
            <li>The oil smelled fresh and not rancid like some oils I have purchased in the past.</li>

            <li> If you want that kind of sweet, light smell right from the bottle, it&#x27;s not gonna happen in this one-not at first at least.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of oil</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy most of my essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but not basil.</li>
            <li> This oil is potent from the moment you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted the smell of fresh cut basil</li>
            <li> Will be getting more oils from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> this has a very strong bitter sent.</li>
            <li> I found that this one is a great scent when just a little is mixed with spearmint or peppermint.  </li>
            <li> You know, the wafty much sweeter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
            <li> and it really did help my neck pain.  </li>
            <li> They also deliver in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> smells really</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The oil has a fresh, clean scent very similar to actual basil leaves.</li>
            <li> It has spiritual and Magical properties...don&#x27;t quote me on this word, it is listed as a possible benifit.</li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> Really really bitter and strong smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Very gender neutral unisex aroma in my opinion, floral enough for a woman&#x27;s perfume and smokey/earthy enough to compliment a more masculine blend.</li>
            <li> not the light herbal sent I expected.</li>
            <li> I still do find that this will work it&#x27;s magic the same as all my essential oils and in particular this one does linger after the oil warmer candle goes out and the house smells devine the next day after burning this.  </li>
            <li> So while it doesn&#x27;t move me like my other essential oils, it does have a strange way of lingering afterwards and becoming much more delightful the next day, with a faint crisp green outdoors scent that I notice when I come in the front</li>
            <li> Basil 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 10 ml</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exploring scents, and this is probably my least favorite that I&#x27;ve experimented with so far.</li>
            <li> Products arrived early and were packed well.</li>
            <li> Definitely can burn if you use too much at a time.</li>
            <li> Next bath I was careful and only put in 2 drops, much better.</li>
            <li> I will always come back to reorder it, for me any my whole family and my relative too...</li>
            <li> I bought Basil (along with a ton of other essential oils) to add to my hair concoctions and thats exactly what it did.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than other oils.</li>
            <li> According to Essential Oil Safety by Tisserand and Young, this is potentially carcinogenic.  </li>
            <li> The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>
            <li> The oil smelled fresh and not rancid like some oils I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit left which I will continue to use in my future hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> It lasts very long time.</li>
            <li> Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received.</li>
            <li> It takes A LOT of other oils to balance out a single drop of this.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> helps with sinuses by putting a few drops in my palm and holding cupped to my nose and deep breathing.  </li>
            <li> Using just a LITTLE will give that kitcheny note you all probably desire,</li>
            <li> Just make you add a little water before you use it.</li>
            <li> buyer beware that a few drops is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> put it plain or add a little olive oil and make it stretch</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not all plants lend themselves well to being distilled and made into essential oil and unfortunately basil is one of those that changes upon distillation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not toxic, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> With the cold and allergy</li>
            <li> I put about 5 drops into a bath and it itched and burned badly.</li>
            <li> Too bad, but not all is lost.  </li>
            <li> Smells terrible to me</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t started using this oil yet however; it smells great and I am looking forward to using it.  I recommend this brand and price!</li>
            <li> Products arrived early and were packed well. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of oil and I look forward to buying again.</li>
            <li> great smell , good product</li>
            <li> Since I love the smell of fresh basil and use it a lot in cooking I was hoping to duplicate that in this oil but it was not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more of a burnt smell, as if you put the basil on the stove and it caught on fire.&lt;br /&gt;While not my favorite oil I still do find that this will work it&#x27;s magic the same as all my essential oils and in particular this one does linger after the oil warmer candle goes out and the house smells devine the next day after burning this.  So while it doesn&#x27;t move me like my other essential oils, it does have a strange way of lingering afterwards and becoming much more delightful the next day, with a faint crisp green outdoors scent that I notice when I come in the front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this if you are after a basil scent, as this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;pungent and burnt smelling, more like a smoldering log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all plants lend themselves well to being distilled and made into essential oil and unfortunately basil is one of those that changes upon distillation.  That being said,&lt;br /&gt;it is not without it&#x27;s charm in it&#x27;s own strange way.</li>
            <li> basil fixes everything. it&#x27;s like lavender and tea tree oil. just keep some around. i use it for skin issues.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. Delivers results. All around great.</li>
            <li> This Basil is a wonderful, sweet oil. I like blending with Frankincense and Grapefruit for a very refreshing smell throughout the house.  I have used it often...buyer beware that a few drops is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly. Definitely can burn if you use too much at a time. I put about 5 drops into a bath and it itched and burned badly. Next bath I was careful and only put in 2 drops, much better.</li>
            <li> this has a very strong bitter sent. not the light herbal sent I expected. i thought it was overwhelming and much richer and harsher than what i think of as the smell of basil.</li>
            <li> Basil is a wonderful addition to many perfume blends, it is said to work as a brain and memory stimulant and soothes stress, depression, and mental fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really helps with stress!!</li>
            <li> am in love with the quality of this brand.  This is my second order and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.  This oil doesn&#x27;t smell as grassy as some others, and diffuses perfectly.</li>
            <li> Really really bitter and strong smell. It takes A LOT of other oils to balance out a single drop of this.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells wonderful. I am using it to create my own oil blends. Received my order quickly and it was packaged very well to avoid breakage. A generous amount for the price compared to similar products. Definitely will be a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Something about this aromatic oil is motivating.  It&#x27;s fine quality, and just a hint of anise.  I found that this one is a great scent when just a little is mixed with spearmint or peppermint.  Basil is also apparently good for the scalp!  I had no idea.</li>
            <li> This worked better than vics vapor rub for my kids it helped them breath alot better and relieve them from congestion at night</li>
            <li> Tried others… This brand is GREAT Quality but MUCH cheeper!!!! I am SOLD on it forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exploring scents, and this is probably my least favorite that I&#x27;ve experimented with so far. It&#x27;s not toxic, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> Very potent. Seems like a good product</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s very useful :)</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars for a couple of reasons. The great thing about this product, is that after the bitter strong scent, the basil-ee smell that most people love will linger in your nose afterwards. Hence this oil doesn&#x27;t have a great first impression, but give it a chance. I do love it. True, it was because I was expecting the smell that one gets when they cut fresh basil leaves when preparing a delicious meal in the kitchen. You know, the wafty much sweeter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be prepared for a different impression. If you want that kind of sweet, light smell right from the bottle, it&#x27;s not gonna happen in this one-not at first at least.  Using just a LITTLE will give that kitcheny note you all probably desire, like me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps packaging and ontime delivery was great once again. This is my second go around ordering from Edens Garden. I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pps my favorites so far (herb-type wise) are basil, rosemary and tea tree. :) Perhaps they would make a great combo together!</li>
            <li> Please do your research on Basil essential oil before choosing this one.  I called the company and they told me the chemtype (CT) of this is estragole.  According to Essential Oil Safety by Tisserand and Young, this is potentially carcinogenic.  It lists Basil (linalool CT)  as the safer choice with no carcinogenic concerns, just a low risk of skin sensitization.  I will continue to buy most of my essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but not basil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more oils from them! Oh my goodness, they were on time, cute packaging, and sent me a leaflet with useful info on how to use the oils, what&#x27;s good about them, healing, incense, I loved it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
            <li> I suppose I wanted that basil smell, but it&#x27;s not at all basil smelling.  I&#x27;d hoped to use it for soaps and lotions, but it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant fragrance.  :*(</li>
            <li> very clean strong scent, really like this oil. Would buy from them again.....</li>
            <li> Made the neck pain &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; and it worked.  It smells very good and it really did help my neck pain.  Put it with the carrier oil and it was fine.</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS PURE AND NATURAL AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE TO USE FOR AROMA THERAPY. WELL PACKED AND LID CLOSES WELL.</li>
            <li> Great Product and great price</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the oils, the product information booklet and the packaging. I highly recommend Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> This oil is potent from the moment you open the bottle.  It has spiritual and Magical properties...don&#x27;t quote me on this word, it is listed as a possible benifit. This oil has a herbaceous aroma, is non-toxic and of course there is the culinary uses and benefits. It may also relieve sinus congestion. Recommend this oil and experiment to see what workd for you.</li>
            <li> Use this in my homemade hair oil</li>
            <li> I have no clue if this is 100% real essential oil but whatever it is, it did its job. I bought Basil (along with a ton of other essential oils) to add to my hair concoctions and thats exactly what it did. It lasted me an entire year and I love the stuff. I still have a little bit left which I will continue to use in my future hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> I like this scent. The quality was great. The oil smelled fresh and not rancid like some oils I have purchased in the past. So I m very pleased with this product. I like to make my own lotions. I thought that this scent smelled best when paired with lemon verbena and other citrus scented essential oils.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this on my account. Says she is very happy with it. Good quality, good value. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The essential oils from Eden&#x27;s garden are by far the most effective and pure oils I have found yet. They also deliver in a very timely manner. I will never purchase anything but Eden&#x27;s garden!</li>
            <li> Nice oil. Good packaging.  The smell is unique and inviting.  It will do nicely in my soap making process.  Nice oil!</li>
            <li> Great smelling basil! Did not think it would be that good, but it was.  Will buy again from this seller.  Product arrived in good condition and packed well.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality.  Great prices.</li>
            <li> I will always come back to reorder it, for me any my whole family and my relative too... Thank you</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, use in a lot of products i&#x27;ve made, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I use this for liver function, plus the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome , doesn&#x27;t keep the bugs away though</li>
            <li> The oils smell delicious. Loved them.</li>
            <li> we all have pain I take this put it plain or add a little olive oil and make it stretch</li>
            <li> Essential oils at a great price!!!  Have ordered before!  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> helps with sinuses by putting a few drops in my palm and holding cupped to my nose and deep breathing.  Will use in diffuser</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> Great mid-note oil to use in a blend.  It would be awesome if it smelled just like fresh cut basil but it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s deeper and heavier.  I&#x27;ve seen descriptions that characterize the aroma as &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; basil but my experience is more like &amp;#34;toasted.&amp;#34;  Meaning, it doesn&#x27;t remind me of something that has been burnt - an unmistakable quality, and something I&#x27;ve done in the kitchen enough times to recognize signature smells - but it&#x27;s definitely more deep and smokey than fresh cut.  Too bad, but not all is lost.  Very gender neutral unisex aroma in my opinion, floral enough for a woman&#x27;s perfume and smokey/earthy enough to compliment a more masculine blend.</li>
            <li> The basil Smells burnt. I really wanted the smell of fresh cut basil but i should have payed better attention to the description and review. I will still uses it for ear infections.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible to me</li>
            <li> Great oil. It lasts very long time. Helps with ear ache. Don&#x27;t put in the ear. :)</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> With the cold and allergy I&#x27;ve had, this oil alleviated my sinus congestion and ear ache, seems pure and high grade. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great as always. Basil isn&#x27;t the best smelling of essential oils in my opinion, but Eden&#x27;s Garden always has the best quality.</li>
            <li> Oil seems good quality....just wish dropper dropped one drop at a time for correct blending.</li>
            <li> EG has, so far, delivered great oils.</li>
            <li> Try this on a mosquito bite!  Great stuff! Keeps bugs away too!</li>
            <li> smells really alcohal-ly</li>
            <li> Love this product and all the others that I have ordered from this person.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase. The oil has a fresh, clean scent very similar to actual basil leaves. I find it invigorating and somewhat sensual. It is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a good product! It  also have a very strong basil smell... Just make you add a little water before you use it.</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Fast Delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Eden Living oils have great quality and awesome prices . much cheaper than other oils.</li>
            <li> i have this oil and most of the others by this brand and i love them all and recommend them</li>
            <li> ARRIVED QUICKLY AND JUST AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li> Basil 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 10 ml&lt;br /&gt;as I&#x27;ve already said - this is a good trader with good products and I will be coming back for sure.</li>
            <li> This Basil cured my daughters ear ache.  Amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Will be getting more oils from this company in the future.</li>
