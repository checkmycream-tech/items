            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Men on this site rated these scissors as good?</li>
            <li>Received in good shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be good for something, but probably not toenails.</li>
            <li>The longer handle was good and did make it easier to reach.</li>
            <li>The length was good</li>
            <li>Also they are kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>This clipper allows me to cut my own toe nails.</li>
            <li>The grips were nice.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are not as sturdy as I would have liked for them to be for the price I paid</li>
            <li>Kind of chops them off, and</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>If anyone has purchased a better clipper, pls come forward! :)</li>
            <li>Much more effective than going at it with clippers.</li>
            <li>Great product from a great online company such as AMAZON.</li>
            <li>The top blade has a serrated edge to grip the nail, which it did, but it was hell on my pedicure.  </li>
            <li>can get to most toenails.</li>
            <li>They should e better made .</li>
            <li>Clippers said&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan if your are going to sell something be more knowledgeable of product..</li>
            <li>Work well - glad we got them.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have it.</li>
            <li>I thought the handle would be stronger and the blades better.</li>
            <li>This product would function better for me if it was about 15 inches</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>as most men today.&lt;br</li>
            <li>,i&#x27;m glad it worked for me.</li>
            <li>I am now able to reach all toenails so I can trim them as needed.  </li>
            <li>The serrated blade does make the scissors safely grip the nail so the cut happens where you want it to.  </li>
            <li>does what it is supposed to do, gives my dad an extra 6 - 8 inches to get to his toe nails, preserving his independece and therefore making him very happy</li>
            <li>I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li>Glad we ordered them.</li>
            <li>and it works okay on them</li>
            <li>Great price and product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Having these scissors is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>The scissors break them more than cut them.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I like them better than clippers.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>CUT VERY CLEAN AND NOT RAGGED .</li>
            <li>instance, if the angle of the blades were set 90 degrees from the handles, toenails could be more easily trimmed from either direction.</li>
            <li>I have an idea of what I may need to have a more comfortable life and most of the time AMAZON has the product, and I never have to START my CAR.</li>
            <li>The scissors did the job in allowing me to easily reach my toenails.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the length and easy grip of the handles is optimal.</li>
            <li>and you could easily stab yourself in the toe.  </li>
            <li>They seem to work just fine but haven&#x27;t used them a lot.</li>
            <li>but I can tell they will do the job fine.....</li>
            <li>I have a somewhat huge calcium deposit on one of my toes,much to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just no way to get a smooth edge.  </li>
            <li>It is great to be independent.</li>
            <li>These scissors seemed to be cheaply made--</li>
            <li>If you have a stiff hip or two,  this is the best alternative to a toe nail clipper that I have seen.  </li>
            <li>have large hands as  MOST  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find these toenail scissors and could hardly wait to get them out of their packing materials when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are very sharp and did a great job of trimming my nails.  </li>
            <li>THE CLIPPER;S WORK  VERY WELL EASY TO POSITION AND ARE SHARPE .THEY</li>
            <li>Work fine, much better than standard size nail scissors.  </li>
            <li>When holding them up to a light I could see a gap between the blades which made me suspect they would not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The holes in the handles are best for smaller hands, and they&#x27;d be more comfortable if they were padded; the plastic coating is quite thin.  </li>
            <li>will be a useful item.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>These will not be useful to someone with thicker nail.</li>
            <li>It would be helpful if the product description included something like &amp;#34;works best on thin toenails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>some range of motion in my right leg</li>
            <li>Angled blade concept was good for me, but scissors don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp.</li>
            <li>I live alone and don&#x27;t have anyone available to help with this.  </li>
            <li>This really allows self-pedicures for handicapped and seniors who can care for their own personal needs.  </li>
            <li>These are really the perfect clippers...the length and angle of the cutters get right where you want to clip and with as little bending as necessary.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived and were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>first snip accomplishes the goal.</li>
            <li>,only thing i didn&#x27;t use was sulfuric acid,i sure was tempted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is so much better than regular toe nail clippers with my circumstances.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described in the advertisement and I had absolutely no difficulty trimming all of my nails nice and even with the ends of my toes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible if I could get a better grip it might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work as described and seem pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>They arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li>I saw high reviews for these toenail scissors and expected them to be exceptional ..</li>
            <li>it was not able to cut my husband&#x27;s toenails but is probably good for cats or dogs, I think we werenot aware of the use</li>
            <li>This item would be better if it was about 15 inches long instead of 8.5 inches.  </li>
            <li>It cuts good, but the thumb hole is small, not ergonomic</li>
            <li>My hands are not that large</li>
            <li>Take a little getting used to, angled blades a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I was also impressed how the serration on one of the blades gripped the nail and did not slip off once I started cutting,  Well done.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bend much after spinal fusion surgery of 3 vertebrae</li>
            <li>and I really had to cram them in there.</li>
            <li>The length was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The whole reason I bought these is because I can&#x27;t reach my toes.  </li>
            <li>Was very hopeful based on reviews, that this would be doable...</li>
            <li>They seem to be of reasonable quality</li>
            <li>Thanks Bob</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it really is flimsy for toenail clipping.</li>
            <li>What this means is that they do not cut very well under pressure.  </li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t work on nails.  </li>
            <li>and so I find these scissors to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>so I took them out and was able to get the looseness out by using a center punch and sweging the screw head a bit.</li>
            <li>delivery was rel fast too.......recommend it.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>As a senior with severe joint problems, bending enough to cut my own toe nails has been a challenge for several years now.</li>
            <li>The extra length of the handles on these scissors cannot be praised enough for the difference it makes between almost getting the job done and completing the job nicely.</li>
            <li>They are OK to just get the nails shorter when you can&#x27;t do it any other way.</li>
            <li>The normal, everyday clippers that I bought at the dollar store are far more useful that these things.</li>
            <li>they will trim clea and sure, powerful, sharp and sturdy enough for a rhino.</li>
            <li>These are not going to  make it with American men whose hands  are large  !!</li>
            <li>Was only able to clip 3 toes in total, with some degree of difficulty at that.  </li>
            <li>The grips could be a little more comfortable, and one&#x27;s fingers can become irritated when used too long at one session.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>the reach is good, but won&#x27;t cut tough nails</li>
            <li>good toe nail clippers even for those tough nails</li>
            <li>appears to be a useful tool, but the plastic handle for the fingers is too small to use comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have normal toe nails</li>
            <li>These scissors are not appropriate for giving a professional pedicure, but they do an effective job trimming nails.</li>
            <li>Also, it was strong enough for my big toes</li>
            <li>Seems too flimsy and not sharp enough to cut cleanly thru even the interior toe nails.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am not able to join the chorus of satisfied reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the super expensive ones that are identical to these.</li>
            <li>I am extra  large or xxxx  </li>
            <li>I have problems bending due to a plate in my hip, so lucky to find this item on amazon......</li>
            <li>Tiny blades can safely get into difficult spaces-and the long handles make using them very easy...</li>
            <li>Good reach, but not so good at cutting tough old nails.  </li>
            <li>not very strong and did not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>I am glad they at least break.</li>
            <li>Would recommend them for people who can not bend completely.</li>
            <li>I have had to return to using the old standby of nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These scissors are a good idea, but unfortunately are not what I seem to need.</li>
            <li>they are well made but not tough enough for my nails</li>
            <li>They are not as heavy as they ones they replace, but they are sharp and effective in clipping my toenails.  </li>
            <li>They were not that strong for my hard nails and handles wanted to twist.  </li>
            <li>First, I was unable to get more than the tips of my fingers through the holes in the grips (and my fingers are relatively skinny.)</li>
            <li>I recommend them if you have no other options.</li>
            <li>As soon as I removed these from the package I could see a major issue.</li>
            <li>Nice but not as heavy duty or as long as I expected for triming my toe nails.  </li>
            <li>* Large * 5.5&amp;#34; Long from the same supplier.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get the right angle when  using them.  </li>
            <li>I got these clippers when I hurt my back and couldn&#x27;t bend over far enough to cut my toenails.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these scissors after a total hip replacement prevents me from bending over far enough to care for my toenails, but  this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>My right hip makes it hard for me to trim my toenails, (bending over that far).  </li>
            <li>but they were not sharp enough to cut even my nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have a bad back and need the extra reach to trim my nails without great pain.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package I noticed that the blades only made contact with each other at the very tip.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t bend over from seated position really at all, so tried from a laying down position to bring feet towards me</li>
            <li>I was in a motorcycle accident and have a hard time bending over due to my big gut I gained after the accident from not being able to move.  </li>
            <li>FWIW, I don&#x27;t think I have super hard nails, but I do trim after showering to help soften them.</li>
            <li>the endpoints being blunt (thick), they cannot be placed UNDER the nail and, most certainly not, under the corner points where ingrowing is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am puzzled, how such opposite results could have been obtained.</li>
            <li>I ordered it with high hopes after reading other ratings.</li>
            <li>these sissors will cut to the quick no matter if you cut you kids nails or your mother in laws, read that as thick beyond understanding.</li>
            <li>The handles are not long enough for me to reach my toes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thank you for the quick shipment.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are very sharp and did a great job of trimming my nails.  </li>
            <li> THE CLIPPER;S WORK  VERY WELL EASY TO POSITION AND ARE SHARPE .THEY</li>
            <li> Work fine, much better than standard size nail scissors.  </li>
            <li> When holding them up to a light I could see a gap between the blades which made me suspect they would not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The holes in the handles are best for smaller hands, and they&#x27;d be more comfortable if they were padded; the plastic coating is quite thin.  </li>
            <li> will be a useful item.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> These will not be useful to someone with thicker nail.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if the product description included something like &amp;#34;works best on thin toenails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> some range of motion in my right leg</li>
            <li> Angled blade concept was good for me, but scissors don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> I live alone and don&#x27;t have anyone available to help with this.  </li>
            <li> This really allows self-pedicures for handicapped and seniors who can care for their own personal needs.  </li>
            <li> These are really the perfect clippers...the length and angle of the cutters get right where you want to clip and with as little bending as necessary.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived and were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> first snip accomplishes the goal.</li>
            <li> ,only thing i didn&#x27;t use was sulfuric acid,i sure was tempted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is so much better than regular toe nail clippers with my circumstances.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described in the advertisement and I had absolutely no difficulty trimming all of my nails nice and even with the ends of my toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible if I could get a better grip it might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work as described and seem pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li> They arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li> I saw high reviews for these toenail scissors and expected them to be exceptional ..</li>
            <li> it was not able to cut my husband&#x27;s toenails but is probably good for cats or dogs, I think we werenot aware of the use</li>
            <li> This item would be better if it was about 15 inches long instead of 8.5 inches.  </li>
            <li> It cuts good, but the thumb hole is small, not ergonomic</li>
            <li> My hands are not that large</li>
            <li> Take a little getting used to, angled blades a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I was also impressed how the serration on one of the blades gripped the nail and did not slip off once I started cutting,  Well done.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bend much after spinal fusion surgery of 3 vertebrae</li>
            <li> and I really had to cram them in there.</li>
            <li> The length was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> The whole reason I bought these is because I can&#x27;t reach my toes.  </li>
            <li> Was very hopeful based on reviews, that this would be doable...</li>
            <li> They seem to be of reasonable quality</li>
            <li> Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it really is flimsy for toenail clipping.</li>
            <li> What this means is that they do not cut very well under pressure.  </li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t work on nails.  </li>
            <li> and so I find these scissors to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> so I took them out and was able to get the looseness out by using a center punch and sweging the screw head a bit.</li>
            <li> delivery was rel fast too.......recommend it.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> As a senior with severe joint problems, bending enough to cut my own toe nails has been a challenge for several years now.</li>
            <li> The extra length of the handles on these scissors cannot be praised enough for the difference it makes between almost getting the job done and completing the job nicely.</li>
            <li> They are OK to just get the nails shorter when you can&#x27;t do it any other way.</li>
            <li> The normal, everyday clippers that I bought at the dollar store are far more useful that these things.</li>
            <li> they will trim clea and sure, powerful, sharp and sturdy enough for a rhino.</li>
            <li> These are not going to  make it with American men whose hands  are large  !!</li>
            <li> Was only able to clip 3 toes in total, with some degree of difficulty at that.  </li>
            <li> The grips could be a little more comfortable, and one&#x27;s fingers can become irritated when used too long at one session.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> the reach is good, but won&#x27;t cut tough nails</li>
            <li> good toe nail clippers even for those tough nails</li>
            <li> appears to be a useful tool, but the plastic handle for the fingers is too small to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have normal toe nails</li>
            <li> These scissors are not appropriate for giving a professional pedicure, but they do an effective job trimming nails.</li>
            <li> Also, it was strong enough for my big toes</li>
            <li> Seems too flimsy and not sharp enough to cut cleanly thru even the interior toe nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not able to join the chorus of satisfied reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the super expensive ones that are identical to these.</li>
            <li> I am extra  large or xxxx  </li>
            <li> I have problems bending due to a plate in my hip, so lucky to find this item on amazon......</li>
            <li> Tiny blades can safely get into difficult spaces-and the long handles make using them very easy...</li>
            <li> Good reach, but not so good at cutting tough old nails.  </li>
            <li> not very strong and did not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> I am glad they at least break.</li>
            <li> Would recommend them for people who can not bend completely.</li>
            <li> I have had to return to using the old standby of nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These scissors are a good idea, but unfortunately are not what I seem to need.</li>
            <li> they are well made but not tough enough for my nails</li>
            <li> They are not as heavy as they ones they replace, but they are sharp and effective in clipping my toenails.  </li>
            <li> They were not that strong for my hard nails and handles wanted to twist.  </li>
            <li> First, I was unable to get more than the tips of my fingers through the holes in the grips (and my fingers are relatively skinny.)</li>
            <li> I recommend them if you have no other options.</li>
            <li> As soon as I removed these from the package I could see a major issue.</li>
            <li> Nice but not as heavy duty or as long as I expected for triming my toe nails.  </li>
            <li> * Large * 5.5&amp;#34; Long from the same supplier.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the right angle when  using them.  </li>
            <li> I got these clippers when I hurt my back and couldn&#x27;t bend over far enough to cut my toenails.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these scissors after a total hip replacement prevents me from bending over far enough to care for my toenails, but  this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> My right hip makes it hard for me to trim my toenails, (bending over that far).  </li>
            <li> but they were not sharp enough to cut even my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a bad back and need the extra reach to trim my nails without great pain.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package I noticed that the blades only made contact with each other at the very tip.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bend over from seated position really at all, so tried from a laying down position to bring feet towards me</li>
            <li> I was in a motorcycle accident and have a hard time bending over due to my big gut I gained after the accident from not being able to move.  </li>
            <li> FWIW, I don&#x27;t think I have super hard nails, but I do trim after showering to help soften them.</li>
            <li> the endpoints being blunt (thick), they cannot be placed UNDER the nail and, most certainly not, under the corner points where ingrowing is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am puzzled, how such opposite results could have been obtained.</li>
            <li> I ordered it with high hopes after reading other ratings.</li>
            <li> these sissors will cut to the quick no matter if you cut you kids nails or your mother in laws, read that as thick beyond understanding.</li>
            <li> The handles are not long enough for me to reach my toes.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that with my large hands, the finger holes were too small</li>
            <li> &amp; they weren&#x27;t long enough for my disabilities--therefore sent them back for credit</li>
            <li> I have large hands and the openings in these clippers are almost too small to use.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I can&#x27;t recommend these scissors - because - although the structure is good - The scissors are way too dull to cut my toenails.  </li>
            <li> I have bought and tried many other products to get my toenails trimmed, and all the others either failed or only partly worked.  </li>
            <li> Tight on adult hands, but still managed to do the job.</li>
            <li> They are awkward enough that I went back to using my cheap drugstore clippers</li>
            <li> I looked at all the &amp;#34;regular nail clippers&amp;#34; on long sticks</li>
            <li> so these long toenail clippers help a lot.</li>
            <li> They are helpful being long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2nd issue,  the blades  are small  , good for cutting paper,,,small finger nails,, maybe a  business  card  maybe  not toe nails which are always thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very thin &amp; too light weight to cut toe nails at all.  </li>
            <li> Work as advertised but not heavy duty enough for thick nails.</li>
            <li> These scissors are helpful for people with limited dexterity, but I think their design could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Not sharp and stiff to work.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money the handles cross over when you try to cut your nail not very well made</li>
            <li> Does not really cut that well.  </li>
            <li> I had a hip replacement which means I have to be careful of how I move my legs.</li>
            <li> I really do not believe they are designed for trimming nails ..</li>
            <li> fingers,, .thumb will NOT  fit inside the  blue rubber slots  as shown ,,I doubt  your did also!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected</li>
            <li> These are just not al all what I expected</li>
            <li> Also clippers were not strong enough either.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and useless!</li>
            <li> They are a little thick but not excessively.  </li>
            <li> Indeed the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; are ridged rather than sharp.</li>
            <li> These Scissors were giving raving reviews by other customers.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and was hopeful.  </li>
            <li> and it really hurts the upper part of my thumb while cutting.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money if you have thick nails.</li>
            <li> negative is thumb &amp; finger whole grips are a little small.</li>
            <li> The long handles versus short blades provide the leverage needed to cut tough nails.  </li>
            <li> one point i was trying to file it down with a file that you use to build things i even used hydrogen peroxide</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at how sharp the points are.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found long handles, that are really long handles, and the clippers have opening that I can get my thick,  toe nails in!  </li>
            <li> All the other jerry rigged devices for extending nail clippers were so heavily criticized that I decided not to take a chance on any of them.  </li>
            <li> but the scissors don&#x27;t seem very sharp.</li>
            <li> (my hands are of average size for an adult male) making the clippers absolutely useless!</li>
            <li> The blades are very thin, but so far I&#x27;ve found them adequate for cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> The first attempt to cut just folded my toenail in between the two cutting edges.</li>
            <li> scissors  are made for small  female hands,,very hard  for a man to  put his fingers in ,,much less his thumb------&lt;br</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I feel like I wasted my money purchasing this particular product.  </li>
            <li> first i was a little leary about cutting that nail with this,but to my delight it took care of it,where nothing else</li>
            <li> well I have a little Arthritis</li>
            <li> They feel a little chintzy.</li>
            <li> Finger hole a little snug.</li>
            <li> I have not used them a lot yet but believe that they could be made a little heavier and stronger.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these if you have those same hard or thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> It arrived within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Metal is to thin to work properly on my toenails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are made in Pakistan, the blades bend and flex so much that it is very difficult to cut a fingernail, much less a toenail.</li>
            <li> The long handle actually made them awkward.</li>
            <li> The handle is not quite long enough and is awkward to try to use.  </li>
            <li> .They are not suitable for cutting much of anything</li>
            <li> I find them hard to use and they don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp .</li>
            <li> I have a bad left hip and these scissors enabled me to reach the toes on my left foot.  </li>
            <li> am not able to use these Scissors at all for the purpose intended: The cutting blades are straight and thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these would work for anyone unless there is a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> The holes in the handle are too small for my fingers</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> As a result I am not able to navigate around a curved nail.</li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes I gave up, as my fingers were sore from the small holes that you put them into to cut with.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these!</li>
            <li> Although the long reaching concept would work well, the blades are missing a nail-cutting edge;  difficult to grab onto and cut the toenails.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to cut off dead skin on my toes!</li>
            <li> Finger holes are too small.</li>
            <li> The finger loops are so small my fingers hurt after a minute or so of use.</li>
            <li> I have very hard toe nails and some other ppl in reviews said they did too</li>
            <li> The holes were way to small for his hands and they were DULL...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s usually a hard stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband who has a bit of a problem reaching his nails to cut them and also has difficulty because they are a bit hard.  </li>
            <li> Even on my little toe&#x27;s fairly thin nail, the blades slipped off and didn&#x27;t cut anything.  </li>
            <li> As it is, you have to awkwardly switch hands to evenly trim a toenail from the opposite side.</li>
            <li> The model&#x27;s hand in the picture must be of a very small woman or child.  </li>
            <li> Also, the scissors themselves do not seem to be very sharp and it&#x27;s difficult to cut the nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously you were or are over 150lbs</li>
            <li> way to weak to cut toe nails, scissors twist-at least that is what I have found.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but found them very awkward to use and was afraid of cutting the skin.  </li>
            <li> this means not good at all</li>
            <li> does not work as expeced  not good on toe nails</li>
            <li> My nails are very hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have very, very thick toenails and cannot stretch as well anymore to reach my toes.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails</li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed and made a product.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> The thin metal arms does not seem to provide the tensile strength to hold the jaws aligned.</li>
            <li> Not great for toenails.</li>
            <li> No more cutting and recutting-</li>
            <li> Disappointing, these are not capable of cutting my toenails, flimsy, inadequate, nope.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to cut toenails with it, in fact nearly impossible, it is hard to operate it, ad it is poorly made.</li>
            <li> All of the other toenail clippers are both useless and painful.  </li>
            <li> However, the cutting edges are way too dull to do the job for which they were intended.  </li>
            <li> I bought this scissor because of a bad hip and I have thick nails.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Paying for the podiatrist to do this as needed is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;RATING: 2 Uncut nails.</li>
            <li> A wrong move</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time bending over</li>
            <li> This the 1st product I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, that I am sorry I bought</li>
            <li> Fibromyalgia-related stiffness of my hip muscles makes it difficult to bend and reach, so these are truly helpful.  </li>
            <li> Useless to me.  </li>
            <li> but  has been very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> I have toenails that needed cutting, not cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll use them for cutting paper.</li>
            <li> I decided to try them anyway and found that the cutting edges didn&#x27;t even touch.</li>
            <li> this scissors are the very bad product so weak to cut</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to maneuver with these scissors.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that the metal on the cutting tips was corroded.</li>
            <li> I need a hip replacement badly and could not use this item.</li>

            <li> These scissors were very awkward for my husband.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work and I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed with the quality.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not worth the money the handles cross over when you try to cut your nail not very well made</li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed and made a product. It is very hard to cut toenails with it, in fact nearly impossible, it is hard to operate it, ad it is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Does what it advertises. I ordered it with high hopes after reading other ratings. It arrived within a few days of ordering. Impressive.</li>
            <li> Good product very good quality and price.</li>
            <li> Cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;Lost some range of motion in my right leg the head angle does not let you reach your foot.had the head angle been closer to 90 would have worked better.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> These are great.  My right hip makes it hard for me to trim my toenails, (bending over that far).  I looked at all the &amp;#34;regular nail clippers&amp;#34; on long sticks and I could never out how you would proper;y position the clipper on my far-away toenails.  These scissors provide the extra 6-8 inches of reach I need to clip my nails.  The long handles versus short blades provide the leverage needed to cut tough nails.  I was also impressed how the serration on one of the blades gripped the nail and did not slip off once I started cutting,  Well done.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bend much after spinal fusion surgery of 3 vertebrae so these long toenail clippers help a lot.</li>
            <li> Add me to the disappointed list. Angled blade concept was good for me, but scissors don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp. Indeed the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; are ridged rather than sharp. I don&#x27;t get that part of the design. I returned them. FWIW, I don&#x27;t think I have super hard nails, but I do trim after showering to help soften them. Not sure how these would work for anyone unless there is a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers when I hurt my back and couldn&#x27;t bend over far enough to cut my toenails.  The clippers are very sharp and did a great job of trimming my nails.  The extra length allowed me to reach all of my toenails without hurting my back.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I can&#x27;t recommend these scissors - because - although the structure is good - The scissors are way too dull to cut my toenails.  They are a little thick but not excessively.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a bad back and need the extra reach to trim my nails without great pain.  The product is a great idea but  has been very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> Work as advertised.Cuts toe nails well</li>
            <li> The scissors did the job in allowing me to easily reach my toenails. Much more effective than going at it with clippers. The only problem I had was that with my large hands, the finger holes were too small and I really had to cram them in there.</li>
            <li> The item arrived and were exactly as described. However, the cutting edges are way too dull to do the job for which they were intended.  I want to return them!</li>
            <li> The length was very helpful.  The top blade has a serrated edge to grip the nail, which it did, but it was hell on my pedicure.  Also, it was strong enough for my big toes but my nails were left ragged.  There&#x27;s just no way to get a smooth edge.  The holes in the handles are best for smaller hands, and they&#x27;d be more comfortable if they were padded; the plastic coating is quite thin.  They are OK to just get the nails shorter when you can&#x27;t do it any other way.</li>
            <li> Does not really cut that well.  I have very, very thick toenails and cannot stretch as well anymore to reach my toes.  Nice idea, but found them very awkward to use and was afraid of cutting the skin.  Will stick to my wire cutter style clippers and stretch the best I can to reach.</li>
            <li> These scissors are helpful for people with limited dexterity, but I think their design could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;For instance, if the angle of the blades were set 90 degrees from the handles, toenails could be more easily trimmed from either direction. As it is, you have to awkwardly switch hands to evenly trim a toenail from the opposite side. Otherwise, the length and easy grip of the handles is optimal. The blades are very thin, but so far I&#x27;ve found them adequate for cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> These are terrible! They don&#x27;t work and I am very disappointed in this product. It is cheaply made and useless!</li>
            <li> Good product.  can get to most toenails.</li>
            <li> Work as advertised but not heavy duty enough for thick nails.</li>
            <li> The holes in the handle are too small for my fingers (my hands are of average size for an adult male) making the clippers absolutely useless!</li>
            <li> They work really great, wish I had bought them 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> They seem to work just fine but haven&#x27;t used them a lot. Seem to be well made and will be a useful item.</li>
            <li> These do NOT work! Too small. Too flimsy. A fraud! A mistake on my part. Still looking for something that works.</li>
            <li> These Scissors were giving raving reviews by other customers. Unfortunately, I am not able to join the chorus of satisfied reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;I am not able to use these Scissors at all for the purpose intended: The cutting blades are straight and thick. As a result I am not able to navigate around a curved nail. Secondly. the endpoints being blunt (thick), they cannot be placed UNDER the nail and, most certainly not, under the corner points where ingrowing is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am puzzled, how such opposite results could have been obtained.</li>
            <li> I find them hard to use and they don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp . They should e better made .</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I noticed that the blades only made contact with each other at the very tip.  When holding them up to a light I could see a gap between the blades which made me suspect they would not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t work at all, as it turned out.  Even on my little toe&#x27;s fairly thin nail, the blades slipped off and didn&#x27;t cut anything.  After a couple of minutes I gave up, as my fingers were sore from the small holes that you put them into to cut with.  The model&#x27;s hand in the picture must be of a very small woman or child.  My hands are not that large but I could only get two fingertips in the larger, bottom part of the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve sent these back for a refund and will search for another option.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these!</li>
            <li> These are still too short to reach from the amount I can bend over. Also they are kind of flimsy. Would like to return them.</li>
            <li> Was told they were made in Canada,wrong. Clippers said&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan if your are going to sell something be more knowledgeable of product..</li>
            <li> it was not able to cut my husband&#x27;s toenails but is probably good for cats or dogs, I think we werenot aware of the use</li>
            <li> The purchase of these scissors was a &amp;#34;best purchase&amp;#34;! Tiny blades can safely get into difficult spaces-and the long handles make using them very easy...but the best feature is the scissor&#x27;s sharpness! No more cutting and recutting-first snip accomplishes the goal. Recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Although the long reaching concept would work well, the blades are missing a nail-cutting edge;  difficult to grab onto and cut the toenails.</li>
            <li> Work well - glad we got them.</li>
            <li> I had a hip replacement which means I have to be careful of how I move my legs. This clipper allows me to cut my own toe nails. I am so glad to have it. It is great to be independent.</li>
            <li> I saw high reviews for these toenail scissors and expected them to be exceptional .. but I was very disappointed with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;They are made in Pakistan, the blades bend and flex so much that it is very difficult to cut a fingernail, much less a toenail. The normal, everyday clippers that I bought at the dollar store are far more useful that these things. I really do not believe they are designed for trimming nails .. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> not very strong and did not cut cleanly. I thought the handle would be stronger and the blades better. Not happy</li>
            <li> I have a bad left hip and these scissors enabled me to reach the toes on my left foot.  It takes a little practice to get the right angle when  using them.  I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> This product would function better for me if it was about 15 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this suggestion will be considered</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and was hopeful.  Was only able to clip 3 toes in total, with some degree of difficulty at that.  It seems one would have to grab the toes with one or both hands to position them to cut.  The whole reason I bought these is because I can&#x27;t reach my toes.  Can&#x27;t bend over from seated position really at all, so tried from a laying down position to bring feet towards me and that&#x27;s where I cut 3 toes struggling along the way.  Also clippers were not strong enough either.  I have been paying someone to cut my nails post surgery (been over a yr) and it got costly.  Was very hopeful based on reviews, that this would be doable...and unfortunately it isn&#x27;t.  If anyone has purchased a better clipper, pls come forward! :)</li>
            <li> Nice but not as heavy duty or as long as I expected for triming my toe nails.  Was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews,,,figured  why not?? Bought them  !!  READ MY LIPPERS!!!|&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scissors  are made for small  female hands,,very hard  for a man to  put his fingers in ,,much less his thumb------&lt;br /&gt;Men on this site rated these scissors as good? How did you get your hands into the scissors?? IF  you look close at the picture-- that&#x27;s  a female hand ( see the bracelet?? As in female!!!)  These are not going to  make it with American men whose hands  are large  !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men on this site claiming to  have used  these I have 2 issues with...&lt;br /&gt;I  doubt  seriously you were or are over 150lbs i weigh 178  skinny  by to days standards&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands as  MOST  men do..no way,,that I am extra  large or xxxx  as most men today.&lt;br /&gt;My fingers,, .thumb will NOT  fit inside the  blue rubber slots  as shown ,,I doubt  your did also!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd issue,  the blades  are small  , good for cutting paper,,,small finger nails,, maybe a  business  card  maybe  not toe nails which are always thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Returning these  as  they are not as  advertised!!&lt;br /&gt;I did buy  the podiatrist  toe nail cutters  --they work wonders!!!</li>
            <li> This item would be better if it was about 15 inches long instead of 8.5 inches.  I have a hip implant and need a longer clipper to reach the toes on that leg.</li>
            <li> If you have a stiff hip or two,  this is the best alternative to a toe nail clipper that I have seen.  All the other jerry rigged devices for extending nail clippers were so heavily criticized that I decided not to take a chance on any of them.  You have to snip away at the nail in sections with this scissors but it gets the job done.  They seem to be of reasonable quality and I haven&#x27;t found why the finger loops should to be a problem unless of course, you have arthritic fingers. Fours stars because a clipper would be easier if someone could invent a workable extension.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat huge calcium deposit on one of my toes,much to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;This cut through it like butter,smooth.&lt;br /&gt;At first i was a little leary about cutting that nail with this,but to my delight it took care of it,where nothing else has.&lt;br /&gt;At one point i was trying to file it down with a file that you use to build things i even used hydrogen peroxide,only thing i didn&#x27;t use was sulfuric acid,i sure was tempted.&lt;br /&gt;So in closing this is a great item from seller and i highly recommend it,i&#x27;m glad it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick shipment.  These look great.  Having a bit of a problem learning to use them but it is so much better than regular toe nail clippers with my circumstances.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found long handles, that are really long handles, and the clippers have opening that I can get my thick,  toe nails in!  Thank You, Thank You!</li>
            <li> As a senior with severe joint problems, bending enough to cut my own toe nails has been a challenge for several years now. I was very happy to find these toenail scissors and could hardly wait to get them out of their packing materials when they arrived. They are exactly as described in the advertisement and I had absolutely no difficulty trimming all of my nails nice and even with the ends of my toes. The extra length of the handles on these scissors cannot be praised enough for the difference it makes between almost getting the job done and completing the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product from a great online company such as AMAZON. I have an idea of what I may need to have a more comfortable life and most of the time AMAZON has the product, and I never have to START my CAR. Great shopping experience, thank you JEFF B.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time and wondered why I didn&#x27;t order them sooner.  They are a big help!  Would order them again.</li>
            <li> I like the length but the scissors don&#x27;t seem very sharp.Couldn&#x27;t get them to cut off dead skin on my toes!</li>
            <li> I am 67, overweight and have arthritis.  I live alone and don&#x27;t have anyone available to help with this.  Paying for the podiatrist to do this as needed is too expensive.  I have bought and tried many other products to get my toenails trimmed, and all the others either failed or only partly worked.  THIS BABY WORKS!  I am now able to reach all toenails so I can trim them as needed.  The scissors is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bend when used.  The serrated blade does make the scissors safely grip the nail so the cut happens where you want it to.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this scissor because of a bad hip and I have thick nails.  It cuts good, but the thumb hole is small, not ergonomic and it really hurts the upper part of my thumb while cutting.  I will probably return it.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do, gives my dad an extra 6 - 8 inches to get to his toe nails, preserving his independece and therefore making him very happy</li>
            <li> Received in good shape. Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> Tight on adult hands, but still managed to do the job. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. It reached where I needed it to and did the job, and that&#x27;s what counts to me.</li>
            <li> Works alright for my needs. I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Glad we ordered them. Would order them again.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, these are not capable of cutting my toenails, flimsy, inadequate, nope.</li>
            <li> appears to be a useful tool, but the plastic handle for the fingers is too small to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> this scissors are the very bad product so weak to cut any simple nail wend I force to cut it bent almost to be breaks this means not good at all</li>
            <li> Product did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> First, I was unable to get more than the tips of my fingers through the holes in the grips (and my fingers are relatively skinny.) I think it would be difficult for most men to use because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it really is flimsy for toenail clipping. It&#x27;s possible if I could get a better grip it might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be good for something, but probably not toenails.</li>
            <li> I have normal toe nails and it works okay on them (my back surgery prevents me from reaching my toes). These will not be useful to someone with thicker nail. You might try SE Podiatrist Toenail Cutter * Large * 5.5&amp;#34; Long from the same supplier.  They are great and the angle is ideal for those of us with bending limitations.</li>
            <li> They work well and priced well I have a little Arthritis and I can reach my toes again that&#x27;s usually a hard stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> Metal is to thin to work properly on my toenails. Scissors just bend and won&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Great price and product and fast shipping.Bonnie Lee</li>
            <li> the reach is good, but won&#x27;t cut tough nails</li>
            <li> All of the other toenail clippers are both useless and painful.  These cut the toenail perfectly.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to maneuver with these scissors.  These definitely did not work for me.  The long handle actually made them awkward.</li>
            <li> Work fine, much better than standard size nail scissors.  Take a little getting used to, angled blades a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is thumb &amp; finger whole grips are a little small.</li>
            <li> This item seemed a bit flimsy.  I have toenails that needed cutting, not cuticles.  The idea is excellent.  The construction leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> These are really the perfect clippers...the length and angle of the cutters get right where you want to clip and with as little bending as necessary.  This really allows self-pedicures for handicapped and seniors who can care for their own personal needs.  Great product!</li>
            <li> does not work as expeced  not good on toe nails</li>
            <li> Having these scissors is better than nothing. They feel a little chintzy. My nails are very hard and brittle. The scissors break them more than cut them. I am glad they at least break. Better than nothing. Finger hole a little snug. I recommend them if you have no other options. All scissors out there seem to be rated the same.</li>
            <li> great product, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I found these to be too flimsy.  The thin metal arms does not seem to provide the tensile strength to hold the jaws aligned. What this means is that they do not cut very well under pressure.  I have tossed these in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: 2 Uncut nails.</li>
            <li> Yup... ahhhhhh...  I can breath again while I trim my toe nails.  I was in a motorcycle accident and have a hard time bending over due to my big gut I gained after the accident from not being able to move.  These are great and I can trim my nails and not pass out from holding my breath.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t work on nails.  I wish I had not bought them.  I would not recommend them to any one!  I guess I&#x27;ll use them for cutting paper.</li>
            <li> I have very hard toe nails and some other ppl in reviews said they did too and it worked for them.  I didn&#x27;t find that so. They were not that strong for my hard nails and handles wanted to twist.  The grips were nice.  I was a little nervous at how sharp the points are. A wrong move and you could easily stab yourself in the toe.  I would not recommend these if you have those same hard or thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my toenails. Finger holes are too small. Not what I was hoping for or expecting.</li>
            <li> These scissors work great.</li>
            <li> these sissors will cut to the quick no matter if you cut you kids nails or your mother in laws, read that as thick beyond understanding. they will trim clea and sure, powerful, sharp and sturdy enough for a rhino. one set for life</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Needed stronger toe nail clippers. The longer handle was good and did make it easier to reach.</li>
            <li> THE CLIPPER;S WORK  VERY WELL EASY TO POSITION AND ARE SHARPE .THEY CUT VERY CLEAN AND NOT RAGGED . THEY ARE VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> These scissors seemed to be cheaply made--&amp; they weren&#x27;t long enough for my disabilities--therefore sent them back for credit</li>
            <li> good toe nail clippers even for those tough nails I would recommend buying these</li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails and unfortunately I feel like I wasted my money purchasing this particular product.  It would be helpful if the product description included something like &amp;#34;works best on thin toenails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the metal on the cutting tips was corroded. Returning the item because of this issue.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time bending over and so I find these scissors to be very helpful.  Would recommend them for people who can not bend completely.</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband who has a bit of a problem reaching his nails to cut them and also has difficulty because they are a bit hard.  He simply could not use these - they would not cut his nails.  The length was good but they were not sharp enough to cut even my nails.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty using these scissors.  I have had to return to using the old standby of nail clippers.  I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the super expensive ones that are identical to these.</li>
            <li> These scissors are not as sturdy as I would have liked for them to be for the price I paid</li>
            <li> way to weak to cut toe nails, scissors twist-at least that is what I have found.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected .They are not suitable for cutting much of anything let alone toenails. Not sharp and stiff to work.</li>
            <li> The grips could be a little more comfortable, and one&#x27;s fingers can become irritated when used too long at one session.</li>
            <li> These scissors were very awkward for my husband. The holes were way to small for his hands and they were DULL... One purchase we wished we had never made!!!!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as I removed these from the package I could see a major issue. I have large hands and the openings in these clippers are almost too small to use. I decided to try them anyway and found that the cutting edges didn&#x27;t even touch. The first attempt to cut just folded my toenail in between the two cutting edges. There is a screw holding the two sides together so I thought no problem I just snug the screw and it will work. No! The screw will not move. Now I have a well equiped shop so I took them out and was able to get the looseness out by using a center punch and sweging the screw head a bit. I have them working now but am still not at all impressed with the inadequite quality of the clippers. My last statement is look else where for a solution for clipping your toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had to sharpen these because they were very dull!!!</li>
            <li> The finger loops are so small my fingers hurt after a minute or so of use. They are awkward enough that I went back to using my cheap drugstore clippers This the 1st product I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, that I am sorry I bought</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money if you have thick nails.</li>
            <li> There Great. So far so good! These reviews frustrate me to no end. If they didn&#x27;t work you would have heard from me months ago</li>
            <li> The handles are not long enough for me to reach my toes. I need a hip replacement badly and could not use this item. Perhaps after the surgery.</li>
            <li> I have not used them a lot yet but believe that they could be made a little heavier and stronger.</li>
            <li> they are well made but not tough enough for my nails</li>
            <li> Good reach, but not so good at cutting tough old nails.  I&#x27;ll probably use it for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to replace a similar pair I lost while traveling.  They are not as heavy as they ones they replace, but they are sharp and effective in clipping my toenails.  These scissors are not appropriate for giving a professional pedicure, but they do an effective job trimming nails.</li>
            <li> To flimsy to dothe job.</li>
            <li> Not great for toenails. Kind of chops them off, and the handles are none too accommodating of a man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> Seems too flimsy and not sharp enough to cut cleanly thru even the interior toe nails.</li>
            <li> have not used them yet but I can tell they will do the job fine.....I have problems bending due to a plate in my hip, so lucky to find this item on amazon......wonderful invention.......delivery was rel fast too.......recommend it.</li>
            <li> They are helpful being long.</li>
            <li> I purchased these scissors after a total hip replacement prevents me from bending over far enough to care for my toenails, but  this product does not work for me.  The handle is not quite long enough and is awkward to try to use.  Also, the scissors themselves do not seem to be very sharp and it&#x27;s difficult to cut the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are a good idea, but unfortunately are not what I seem to need.</li>
            <li> These did not work for me but possibly because I was use too clippers.</li>
            <li> These work great. I like them better than clippers.</li>
            <li> These work as described and seem pretty sturdy.  Fibromyalgia-related stiffness of my hip muscles makes it difficult to bend and reach, so these are truly helpful.  They arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Best scissors I ever owned</li>
            <li> Useless to me.  Very thin &amp; too light weight to cut toe nails at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the description stated that there were serrated edges to grip the toenail, NO SERRATED EDGES! These are just not al all what I expected and I will be returning them.</li>
