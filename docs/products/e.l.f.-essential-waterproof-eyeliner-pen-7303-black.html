            <li>work well and its lines great .</li>
            <li>Gives great control when lining and stays on.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It didnt budge with water or wiping a cloth over it, which is good for extended wear.</li>
            <li>Think it is a good product</li>
            <li>but I am not so good with makeup.</li>
            <li>I had this product recommended to me by a friend, the shipping was about NZ$10 - much more than the cost of the product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any Eyeliner Pens which is why i decided to buy elf&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>have a new elf dollar section which is awesome!)</li>
            <li>The application is very easy, and it will stay on all day without smudging.</li>
            <li>Works great, does exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li>and it is very precise.</li>
            <li>I bought more.</li>
            <li>I love that i can control how thick/thin</li>
            <li>how many times I tried to draw over it.  </li>
            <li>I would give this more stars but...</li>
            <li>This is more of a marker type tip, versus the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; style.    </li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and i love their cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Not too pleased.</li>
            <li>I usually love e.l.f. products but not this one.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li>But if you want something that will work without having to go all McGyver, you&#x27;d be better off getting a pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and easy to apply !</li>
            <li>Best dollar I ever spent!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it comes off quite easily when you wash your face.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I think the formulas are a bit different, the dipping kind is a tad more watery but works amazingly with primer under it)my advice</li>
            <li>Mine works just fine.</li>
            <li>It is May 6th 2012, and mine is still usable, So make sure the product is freshly stocked.</li>
            <li>So even though these are cheap, buying them can be a gamble.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased that wasn&#x27;t dried up was excellent.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cheap because they don&#x27;t pay for advertising campaigns like Cover Girl or Maybelline.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get the eyeliner.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get the one that is full or the one that hasn&#x27;t been sitting around, this is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Splurge the extra $$ for a good quality liner-I&#x27;m sticking to the Koji Dolly eyeliner and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>and i was at the fair walking around and such !</li>
            <li>This product is fine the first two or three times you use it.</li>
            <li>Its not even worth losing a dollar over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that issue before, which is why I rarely buy liquid products from the stores, but rather</li>
            <li>There are so many other better liquid eyeliners out there.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying one that works for a little bit more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll likely invest in a better product when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I could buy the whole shelf and never have to buy eyeliner again!</li>
            <li>The first time I opened one</li>
            <li>If you leave the cap off over more than an hour you might as well throw it away instantly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run and works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Should have looked here in the first place.</li>
            <li>The color shows up nicely, and I like the applicator style compared to other liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I also got their other liquid liner, the one that you dip, and it is just as great and costed only $1(although</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a dud, but this is honestly just not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Ladies if your looking for a good eyeliner that you wont waste your money on THIS IS NOT IT!</li>
            <li>For a company that offers cheap products that are relatively high quality, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>They rely purely on word of mouth to get their products sold.</li>
            <li>Be smart, people.</li>
            <li>I like E.l.f. products, I really do.  </li>
            <li>Makes putting on eyeliner much easier.</li>
            <li>Let me first say it&#x27;s definitely NOT waterproof...however if you&#x27;re not rubbing your eyes it will last for the whole day and it does glide on easy.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford anything else, I suppose these will do if you can get creative (like going over the line with dark eyeliner).</li>
            <li>So I bought this with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Again, I would have given more stars if I could buy one knowing whether it was dried out or not.</li>
            <li>it was a gift from my mother, and it was dark and went on smooth ans</li>
            <li>This is natural and will happen</li>
            <li>You never know how old the product will be on here.</li>
            <li>and it has not dried out at all, even using it about every day.</li>
            <li>bought my pens directly from ELF</li>
            <li>First off I opened it in the car to try it on my eye and not even within five seconds did the eyeliner pen dry up.</li>
            <li>The formula is not good either because I found that if I try and darken the line, the felt tip wipes off the existing line instead of depositing more pigment, because the tip is so dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a watered down black marker for lack of a better term.  </li>
            <li>But even eye makeup remover barely put a dent.</li>
            <li>It barely worked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still there and barely needs touch up.</li>
            <li>Mine was so dried out, and I used it right after I bought it.</li>
            <li>(a gentle wipe works all my other makeup) and then having to use a soap to scrub.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and dark, but eyeliner consistency is a bit thick, making it difficult to get a smooth line.</li>

            <li> It would kind of show up when I wrote with it on my hand, but when it came to applying it on my eyelids, the pen tip was just plain crappy and gave my the most horrible, black/gray line</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a model or someone who values expensive products, that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being too dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different colors like the plum and the teal that last for 2-3 months and other colors like black and brown that dry up after a weeks use.</li>
            <li> Not hard to get off or hard to apply it.</li>
            <li> Dried up completely after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner last June 2011 in black and coffee brow.</li>
            <li> A dollar I could have spent somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Also, for those of you that got dried out pens, that sucks, you probably just got old ones, especially if you bought them from ebay or amazon instead of the store.</li>
            <li> when I purchased my second E.L.F waterproof eyeliner it was completely dried.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with ELF products.</li>
            <li> I was lazy and left it on)</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the pen was dried out because it had sat on the shelf for too long.</li>
            <li> A week later it was beyond dried up!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it again when I used it all up and tried a couple of other brands trying to find a simlar product.</li>
            <li> I ended up needing several rounds of hard scrubbing with the eye make up remover</li>
            <li> It is simply too hard to get anything out it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying, not worth it.</li>
            <li> but i would recommend storing it either upside down or on its side.</li>
            <li> I will never be buying any other eyeliner again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this pen for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> the eyeliner dont smudge and its the black liner i ever used .</li>
            <li> it was waterproof, but the bad thing about the pen, it dries out quickly</li>
            <li> I read a previous comment saying that the eyeliner pen dried up.</li>
            <li> Was completely dried out when I received it.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the few dollars at all!</li>
            <li> When the pen arrived, it was completely dried up in the package.</li>
            <li> Trust my words when I say this is the biggest waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them expecting greatness.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve bought some that were dried up after a few use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like my eyes were lined at all, the color was so dull and watered down no matter</li>
            <li> I do have a few small issues with ELF&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> There are very few products that I use that are not ELF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to take off</li>
            <li> Like someone else said, they mean it when they say waterproof.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately once they arrived they were dried up.</li>
            <li> it was dried up when i recieved it, so i was unable to use it granted</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews saying this stuff sucks, but you guys are jumping to conclusions!</li>
            <li> Very hard to take off after washing your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof and they mean it!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too broken up about tossing them after a week or so.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re in the position to buy expensive products, why are you buying a 1$ product then trashing it because it doesn&#x27;t measure up to your 10$ product?</li>
            <li> But i was very disappointed because it was almost dry.</li>
            <li> eyeliner was just a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It makes me so mad.</li>
            <li> ALL of them totally useless. :(</li>
            <li> this stuff is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Just really disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just stupid.</li>
            <li> Terrible huh?</li>

            <li> Was completely dried out when I received it. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pen did not even work. It was not worth the few dollars at all! When the pen arrived, it was completely dried up in the package. Warning, do not buy this pen. You are better off buying one that works for a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner last June 2011 in black and coffee brow. It is May 6th 2012, and mine is still usable, So make sure the product is freshly stocked. Mine works just fine. I bought more.</li>
            <li> I read a previous comment saying that the eyeliner pen dried up. I did not have that problem at all. I&#x27;ve had this pen for about a month and a half now and i have been using it faithfully ever since! I love that i can control how thick/thin i want my line to be and it is very precise. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being too dry but i would recommend storing it either upside down or on its side. Best dollar I ever spent!</li>
            <li> I like E.l.f. products, I really do.  So I bought this with high hopes.  However upon swiping it across my eyes it looked like..a watered down black marker for lack of a better term.  It didn&#x27;t look like my eyes were lined at all, the color was so dull and watered down no matter how many times I tried to draw over it.  Don&#x27;t even think about buying this.  Splurge the extra $$ for a good quality liner-I&#x27;m sticking to the Koji Dolly eyeliner and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Let me first say it&#x27;s definitely NOT waterproof...however if you&#x27;re not rubbing your eyes it will last for the whole day and it does glide on easy. For now it&#x27;s my go-to for winged eyeliner but I&#x27;ll likely invest in a better product when it runs out.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and dark, but eyeliner consistency is a bit thick, making it difficult to get a smooth line. No worries, I figured I could wipe away the excess and start again. WRONG. this stuff is very difficult to remove. It didnt budge with water or wiping a cloth over it, which is good for extended wear. But even eye makeup remover barely put a dent. I ended up needing several rounds of hard scrubbing with the eye make up remover (a gentle wipe works all my other makeup) and then having to use a soap to scrub. I still didn&#x27;t get it entirely. It promptly went in the trash, not intersted in that level of effort to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> For under $1, I guess I bought what I deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner was just a disappointment. It barely worked. Maybe I just got a dud, but this is honestly just not worth the money. Mine was so dried out, and I used it right after I bought it. It would kind of show up when I wrote with it on my hand, but when it came to applying it on my eyelids, the pen tip was just plain crappy and gave my the most horrible, black/gray line ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would pass on this. There are so many other better liquid eyeliners out there.</li>
            <li> Trust my words when I say this is the biggest waste of money. If your thinking about buying it. DONT DO IT!! DO-NOT-DO-IT! Its not even worth losing a dollar over. First off I opened it in the car to try it on my eye and not even within five seconds did the eyeliner pen dry up. It makes me so mad. A dollar I could have spent somewhere else. Ladies if your looking for a good eyeliner that you wont waste your money on THIS IS NOT IT!</li>
            <li> I had this product recommended to me by a friend, the shipping was about NZ$10 - much more than the cost of the product! I bought a few of them expecting greatness. Unfortunately once they arrived they were dried up. ALL of them totally useless. :(</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner out there! The application is very easy, and it will stay on all day without smudging. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it comes off quite easily when you wash your face. This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ll get now!</li>
            <li> Think it is a good product but I am not so good with makeup.</li>
            <li> Absoulutly love this eyeliner !!! It is so smooth and easy to apply ! i only have to apply it once a day ! As a matter a fact it was still on the next morning and i was at the fair walking around and such ! It is very good quality for a phenomenal price !!! I recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews saying this stuff sucks, but you guys are jumping to conclusions! I got this for $1 at Target(they have a new elf dollar section which is awesome!) I tried it without primer and it ran, so then I tried it AFTER putting eyelid primer underneath first(the $1 elf kind) and it is AMAZING!!! I will never be buying any other eyeliner again! I also got their other liquid liner, the one that you dip, and it is just as great and costed only $1(although I think the formulas are a bit different, the dipping kind is a tad more watery but works amazingly with primer under it)my advice is to ALWAYS use primer UNDER/BEFORE your liquid eyeliner, because some are watery and will spread or run into your skin creases. This is natural and will happen and that&#x27;s what primer is for. Why would you spend $6-$18 on a liquid eyeliner when you can get some for $1 and get the same effect just using primer underneath as you should? I could buy the whole shelf and never have to buy eyeliner again! lol anyway, it also stays on literally ALL DAY, and when I wake up in the morning(if I was lazy and left it on) it&#x27;s still there and barely needs touch up. I would give it another try with primer, but buy it at Target for $1. Also, for those of you that got dried out pens, that sucks, you probably just got old ones, especially if you bought them from ebay or amazon instead of the store. You never know how old the product will be on here. I have had mine over a week and it has not dried out at all, even using it about every day.</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars but...when I purchased my second E.L.F waterproof eyeliner it was completely dried. Not even a hint of product was left. So even though these are cheap, buying them can be a gamble. The one I purchased that wasn&#x27;t dried up was excellent. Like someone else said, they mean it when they say waterproof. I can only get this stuff off using baby oil. The color shows up nicely, and I like the applicator style compared to other liquid eyeliners. This is more of a marker type tip, versus the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; style.    Again, I would have given more stars if I could buy one knowing whether it was dried out or not.</li>
            <li> Works great, does exactly what the description says. Very hard to take off after washing your face. I recommend this for day time waer or night time. Works great all around.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the eyeliner. I don&#x27;t own any Eyeliner Pens which is why i decided to buy elf&#x27;s. They are inexpensive and i love their cosmetics. But i was very disappointed because it was almost dry. It doesn&#x27;t leave a solid line. It is simply too hard to get anything out it.</li>
            <li> it was dried up when i recieved it, so i was unable to use it granted it was inexpensive but still</li>
            <li> It stopped working after the 4th time using it. Terrible huh? Just really disappointed in it.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying, not worth it.</li>
            <li> work well and its lines great . the eyeliner dont smudge and its the black liner i ever used .</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s hard to take off but I find that leaving it on and getting it off in the shower works with all the steam. But I do recommend it!!</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with ELF products. They&#x27;re so cheap because they don&#x27;t pay for advertising campaigns like Cover Girl or Maybelline. They rely purely on word of mouth to get their products sold. I swear by this eyeliner pen because it&#x27;s waterproof and I can wear it to the club with my girlfriends and sweat for 4 hours, come home and collapse on the bed and wake up 8 hours later and it&#x27;s still there. It&#x27;s waterproof and they mean it! I do have a few small issues with ELF&#x27;s products. They&#x27;re cheap for a reason. Don&#x27;t expect a Lancome-quality product for 1$. That&#x27;s just stupid. If you want extra staying power, invest in ELF&#x27;s 3$ Liner Sealer. Perhaps, the pen was dried out because it had sat on the shelf for too long. I&#x27;ve had that issue before, which is why I rarely buy liquid products from the stores, but rather their website. I don&#x27;t like how they package their mascara, with the wands already in the tube, and I don&#x27;t like how wasteful some of their packaging is. But in all honesty, I swear by ELF. There are very few products that I use that are not ELF. For a company that offers cheap products that are relatively high quality, I can&#x27;t really complain. If you&#x27;re a model or someone who values expensive products, that&#x27;s fine. Don&#x27;t buy them. But if you&#x27;re in the position to buy expensive products, why are you buying a 1$ product then trashing it because it doesn&#x27;t measure up to your 10$ product? Be smart, people.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened one it was a gift from my mother, and it was dark and went on smooth ans easily I LOVED it! A week later it was beyond dried up! I&#x27;ve had different colors like the plum and the teal that last for 2-3 months and other colors like black and brown that dry up after a weeks use. If you leave the cap off over more than an hour you might as well throw it away instantly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get the one that is full or the one that hasn&#x27;t been sitting around, this is a great eyeliner. Gives great control when lining and stays on. However, I&#x27;ve bought some that were dried up after a few use. But what did you expect for a dollar?</li>
            <li> Dried up completely after only a few uses. Also the felt tip started falling apart. Not too pleased. I usually love e.l.f. products but not this one.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Easy to hold. Goes on smooth. Makes putting on eyeliner much easier. I just hope theres enough &#x27;ink&#x27; in the pen that it will last me a while.. I guess i&#x27;ll find out</li>
            <li> Works great.  It doesn&#x27;t run and works exactly as promised.  Not hard to get off or hard to apply it.</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> This product is fine the first two or three times you use it. After that, it&#x27;s a try felt tip pen. The formula is not good either because I found that if I try and darken the line, the felt tip wipes off the existing line instead of depositing more pigment, because the tip is so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my pens directly from ELF and I think I paid like $2 or $3 so I wasn&#x27;t too broken up about tossing them after a week or so. The lesson? If you can&#x27;t afford anything else, I suppose these will do if you can get creative (like going over the line with dark eyeliner). But if you want something that will work without having to go all McGyver, you&#x27;d be better off getting a pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li> it was waterproof, but the bad thing about the pen, it dries out quickly</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner. I&#x27;ve used pencil eyeliners for years but when I tried this, I was hooked. I couldn&#x27;t find it again when I used it all up and tried a couple of other brands trying to find a simlar product. I was happy to find it on Amazon. Should have looked here in the first place.</li>
