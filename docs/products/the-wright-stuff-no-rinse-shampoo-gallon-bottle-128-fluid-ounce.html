            <li>And a gallon is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>They use this exact product.</li>

            <li>It enables them, or a caregiver, to easily keep their hair clean without the worry of sinks, water , rinsing out, and shampoo in the eyes.</li>

            <li>It is a gift of ease of use and really cleans the hair just as directed.</li>
            <li>Because it is really that</li>
            <li>Just use this after the ballgame and go straight on over to wherever your going</li>
            <li>The hair is left clean, fresh, and soft.</li>

            <li>As a guy, obviously, I have a far more &#x27;hairy&#x27; body then a female.</li>
            <li>It is useful when a full water shampoo is not available.</li>
            <li>This gallon size has a different smell, almost a baby oil smell, than the 16 oz bottles; make sure you dry your hair well or the smell will linger.  </li>
            <li>Had a live person on the phone within 1 minute.</li>
            <li>let me rephrase that..water is rarely available in the middle of nowhere, deep in the woods.</li>
            <li>I am disabled and cannot shower easily.  </li>
            <li>no matter what your doing or where you are at, you know you can always be clean in less then 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> tubs are just too difficult and dangerous.</li>
            <li> And doing what we do, we get quite sweaty and dirty.</li>
            <li> no need to jump in the shower or sit in your house sweaty and dirty.</li>

            <li> Excelent product !!! I use it with my mother in law that is disable and it is a life saving product...</li>
            <li> Works well and is very convenient when you can&#x27;t shower for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I have naturally greasy hair and use this product daily. Sometimes more in the summer. It dries quickly with a towel and leave my hair managable. Great when your camping or traveling if showering is not available. May need to try the body wash next for those camping excursions.[[ASIN:B000SOLBU6 No Rinse Shampoo Gallon Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Having used this product as a nurse in hospitals, I knew how good it works for those who can&#x27;t get into a shower, put their head under a tap or are ill and can&#x27;t use any other method to wash their hair.  It is a gift of ease of use and really cleans the hair just as directed. Hard to find outside of a hospital or home nursing service but of course, Amazon is always my first choice to look!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my Mother when she became bedridden.  I also used it myself.  It is an excellent product, but I had not been able to find it in Drugstores, Beauty Supply stores, or anywhere else.  I checked Amazon, &amp; there it was!  It really made my day!</li>
            <li> First, about the seller : AMZN said shipping would take 2 weeks.It arrived on my doorstep in 3 days! Awesome!Had a question, as this was a GALLON but pic on AMZN showed 16oz bottle. Contacted the seller. Had a live person on the phone within 1 minute. She was very nice and confirmed it was a gallon and to ignore the PIC on AMZN. And a gallon is exactly what I got. I highly rec this seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product- This stuff is simply GREAT. Listen, if NASA uses this exact product for their Folks floating out in space, you know it has to be good. And it is!! NASA could buy ANY product to use. Heck, they could make their own. But they dont. They use this exact product. Why? Because it is really that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant speak for the NO RINSE BODY BATH as I&#x27;ve never tried it, but im sure it is just as good as the NO RINSE SHAMPOO. The NR BODY BATH may be great for many, but you do need at least a little warm water. The NR SHAMPOO requires NO WATER. First used this many years ago as the wife and me spent alot of time &#x27;in the woods&#x27;. Camping, rock climbing, kayaking...anything outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, water is not always available...let me rephrase that..water is rarely available in the middle of nowhere, deep in the woods. And doing what we do, we get quite sweaty and dirty. Even in the woods, we must feel and be clean after doing whatever. This stuff is simply an amazing product. ZERO water is needed. Just use it, rub it in wherever, it lathers up and you simply wipe dry with towel or anything you have. And trust me, you will not only smell clean, you will feel just as clean as if you just took a long hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GREAT thing about this product is you can use it ALL OVER YOUR BODY. No need for the NR BODY BATH that does require water. As a guy, obviously, I have a far more &#x27;hairy&#x27; body then a female. This stuff lathers up great ANYWHERE on my body and I use it ALL OVER MY ENTIRE BODY, even in my &#x27;private areas&#x27;. The wife who has very little hair, also uses it ALL OVER HER BODY. And it works/cleans her just as good as it does me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product everybody should have/try/use and its not just for when your in the middle of nowhere with no water. You can use this anytime. Working out in the yard....working up a sweat playing outside with the kids....No problem...Just use this product and you&#x27;ll be clean in 2 minutes...no need to jump in the shower or sit in your house sweaty and dirty. If your out and about and have plans later, just carry a very small bottle with you..no need to go home to shower..Just use this after the ballgame and go straight on over to wherever your going and you&#x27;ll be clean as a whistle without needing to go home and shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is simply awesome. Most everybody I know that uses it does what we do..we always have a small bottle with use all the time as you never know when you may need it and it&#x27;s nice knowing you have some with you so no need to try and stay clean or worry your sweating too much..no matter what your doing or where you are at, you know you can always be clean in less then 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of companies that sell this product. You can get small 2oz or 4oz bottles, or 16oz or 32oz bottles. However, this is the only place i&#x27;ve found a GALLON and just do the math as compared to the price of the smaller bottles. The gallon is a HUGE SAVINGS and you will fall in love with this stuff and will surely want a gallon since it can and will be used very often. Depending on where we are going and what we are doing, we may just fill up a 2oz or 4oz bottle and take with use as that is plenty for me, the wife and kids for a day. If we are gonna be camping for a little while, we&#x27;ll take a 16oz bottle as well as some 2oz and 4oz bottles. The 16oz bottle stays wherever and we&#x27;ll simply fill a 2oz or 4oz bottle and toss it in the backpack which is plenty for the day until we get back to our campsite, where we have the 16oz bottle waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, just try this product and you will love it!! And you WILL use it far more often then you think.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, just try this product and you will love it!! And you WILL use it far more often then you think.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every day.</li>
            <li> I am in a nursing home and the No Rinse products are fantastic for bathing in bed. I am going to use it at home for those \\&quot;I need a quick bath and or hair wash\\&quot; moments. Good for anybody that&#x27;s sick, laid up or disabled and showering and bath tubs are just too difficult and dangerous. The shampoo is really fantastic. Just need a towel to get clean hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a long time. Works great all though I use it as a regular shampoo and mostly rinse afterwards. Recently my kids have taken to it as well. It&#x27;s gentle on the hair and leaves it soft and manageable. Products arrived very quickly and no surprises. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you need to use this type of cleaner routinely, I recommend buying it in bulk. The price is great when compared to the cost of small bottles. My mom can&#x27;t use the bath tube but wants to wash regularly. This product helps her keep her hair clean without danger of falling. Mom recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great on my invalid wife to keep her very clean when it is not possible to give her a shower.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work that great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, much easier than bending over a sink from my wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Does the job nice economy size</li>
            <li> Good stuff; it works.  This gallon size has a different smell, almost a baby oil smell, than the 16 oz bottles; make sure you dry your hair well or the smell will linger.  Not a bad smell, but I prefer the 16 oz bottle smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled and it is difficult for me to get in the shower everyday, so I use this on my hair on those day I can&#x27;t shower.  It&#x27;s good stuff, I just rub it on dry hair and it foams up just like regular shampoo.  Then towel dry.  Sometimes it will take two applications if it doesn&#x27;t foam up.  There is a slight &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; smell that is completely gone when the hair dries. Be careful and not get it in your eyes, it will burn a little until you can rinse them out.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and cannot shower easily.  I use No Rinse Shampoo a few times a week.  Easy to use and does a good job cleaning my hair and scalp.  Make sure to towel dry your hair well after working in the lather and massaging the scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue then.  I usually let my hair air dry for a little while then use a hair dryer to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months.  I have short straight hair but when I use this product as directed my hair is soft with more curl than I knew I had.  I use it with my mother who is wheelchair bound until knee surgery and it worked as well on her as it does on me.  In a grid-down situation, this would do any one&#x27;s self confidence good to be clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is the best item to buy for someone who is disabled, or ill. It enables them, or a caregiver, to easily keep their hair clean without the worry of sinks, water , rinsing out, and shampoo in the eyes. It is quick, so it does not wear out the person, and it works very well. It even works very, very well for those of us who are in a hurry, or, do not feel like bending over the sink to wash our hair. The hair is left clean, fresh, and soft.</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff as I have been taking care of My Senior Parents.  I started using it between showers and on My hair.  My &#x27;super dandruff&#x27; stopped and it&#x27;s a great beard wash after eating.  The only downer is no &#x27;Zero &#x27;G&#x27; environment!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. It did a good job.</li>
            <li> I use no-rinse shampoo just like any other shampoo .  I have a thyroid condition which usually results in dry hair.  When I go shopping I have received compliment on how nice my hair looks.  The shampoo must  have  a ph level that is more acid balanced.  By using this shampoo - I do not have to use conditioners and therefore I not only save time but I save money also.</li>
            <li> When our water heater stopped working we had to take showers at other people&#x27;s houses.  I just washed my hair with this and stayed clean.</li>
            <li> I needed a shampoo that used no water... it does not meet my needs it does not meet my needs</li>
            <li> I use this a lot when I have flare ups or am in a hurry</li>
            <li> This product works great. It is useful when a full water shampoo is not available. Smells good and hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> great product would dilute down more than says on label though.</li>
            <li> This is the best no rinse shampoo I&#x27;ve tried</li>
