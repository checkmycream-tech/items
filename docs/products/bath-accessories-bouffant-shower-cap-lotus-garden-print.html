            <li>After wasting so much money on shower caps, this cap is by far the best cap I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li>It is lined with plastic rather than terry cloth which I thought might make me sweaty, but I have been just fine.</li>
            <li>Nice large cap-sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many shower caps that leave the edges of my hair wet, so I was happy to discover this one.</li>
            <li>They fit the head and you wont&#x27; look like a huge puffball head wearing this.</li>
            <li>For years I have been making do with reusing the cheap ones from hotels.</li>
            <li>This very comfortable shower cap is attractive and keeps hair dry and is very well made...</li>
            <li>Finally took a moment to find another good cloth shower cap.</li>
            <li>Good cap, but not as big as I needed.</li>
            <li>The patterns for Spa Sister are lovely and the double layer construction of fabric on top and plastic vinyl below does perform.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but not what I would call &amp;#34;bouffant&amp;#34; in size.</li>
            <li>It is great for keeping my hair dry and after use, it dries very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and I am 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and mine fits just right.</li>
            <li>the fabric is really cool, very retro.</li>
            <li>It smells like mothballs and plastic when you first get it.</li>
            <li>Its rather cute actually.</li>
            <li>34;bouffant hairdo.&amp;#34;  The cap I received is a regular fitting</li>
            <li>I found the cap to be very comfortable and it kept my hair dry while showering.</li>
            <li>but if I had any more hair I&#x27;m not sure that it would fit (</li>
            <li>It has a waterproof lining that really works.</li>

            <li>It is high quality and</li>
            <li>Crushed my medium length, fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cute, but it actually keeps your hair dry!</li>
            <li>Cap comes without any lingering plastic smell; my only criticism is that it isn&#x27;t really &#x27;bouffant&#x27;.</li>
            <li>bought this to share with my 6 year old daughter and it does look bouffant on her however.</li>
            <li>I can wear it and it does a decent job keeping my shortish (currently) hair dry, but the elastic just hugs my hairline.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you had really long hair, there is not enough cap to really keep all the hair dry.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the fit. I have a small head and often buy kids sizes for hats so this is great. It has a waterproof lining that really works. Substantial for the money</li>
            <li> After wasting so much money on shower caps, this cap is by far the best cap I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Was looking for a cap to keep my hair completely dry and this one does just that!  Not to mention, it&#x27;s very cute!</li>
            <li> It smells like mothballs and plastic when you first get it. Ugh. But just wash it in soap and it lessens. They fit the head and you wont&#x27; look like a huge puffball head wearing this. Its rather cute actually. The outside is soft and its comfortable so you forget you have it on. My daughter says hers is a little tight. She is 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and I am 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and mine fits just right. Consider that since its one size fits all.</li>
            <li> I have owned several shower caps and I really like this one. It is lined with plastic rather than terry cloth which I thought might make me sweaty, but I have been just fine. Also it is not gigantic, I have a big head and longish hair and it covers everything but without having a ton on extra room, which I like. It is high quality and the fabric is really cool, very retro.</li>
            <li> Cute pattern, but it is not bouffant.  The size would not cover hair of any volume. The available patterns were attractive.</li>
            <li> I had a great shower cap and it wore out. For years I have been making do with reusing the cheap ones from hotels. Finally took a moment to find another good cloth shower cap. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very cute pattern/colors, very good quality, my only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t have as much space as I would like.  It does the job well but if I had any more hair I&#x27;m not sure that it would fit (but I guess if it was bigger it would be too big for some people???).  My hair is long and thick.  Does the job well.  Very fun!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of shower caps for some time.  It is great for keeping my hair dry and after use, it dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;These caps are very cute too!</li>
            <li> Roomy for people with long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (just above the bra strap) and it is a challenge to get all of my hair underneath the cap. Even when I do my hairline is exposed all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Betty Dain Mold Resistant Shower Caps for long hair.</li>
            <li> wish it were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The patterns for Spa Sister are lovely and the double layer construction of fabric on top and plastic vinyl below does perform. Cap comes without any lingering plastic smell; my only criticism is that it isn&#x27;t really &#x27;bouffant&#x27;. If you had really long hair, there is not enough cap to really keep all the hair dry.

            <li> Good cap, but not as big as I needed.</li>
            <li> This very comfortable shower cap is attractive and keeps hair dry and is very well made... I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Nice large cap-sturdy.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like it&#x27;s for a &amp;#34;bouffant hairdo.&amp;#34;  The cap I received is a regular fitting&lt;br /&gt;shower cap.  the picture is phony!  The cap I received would flatten and ruin a bouffant hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Small</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but not what I would call &amp;#34;bouffant&amp;#34; in size. Crushed my medium length, fine curly hair. Would probably work well for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The pattern on this shower cap is very cute. I found the cap to be very comfortable and it kept my hair dry while showering.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair really dry. It&#x27;s lined and thick. I love this when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair. I should&#x27;ve bought one a long time ago. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t dry fast because its so thick. I&#x27;m afraid it might get the dirty towel smell after a while because of the dry time but I suppose I could wash it if that happens. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this. The print is nice.</li>
            <li> Not only is it cute, but it actually keeps your hair dry! I&#x27;ve gone through many shower caps that leave the edges of my hair wet, so I was happy to discover this one.</li>
