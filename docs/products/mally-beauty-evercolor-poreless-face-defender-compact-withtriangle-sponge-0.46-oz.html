            <li>lol.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing and does what is claims - covers pores perfectly without that powdery look and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Love this....works best on tv.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin like me, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the concept!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup and face look so much better at the end of the workday now!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pretty confident that this will hold up after a night of dancing!!!</li>
            <li>PURCHASE THE &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL SKIN PREP&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll get 2 full-sized products (Primer &amp; Face Defender) for the price of one &amp; they both make your face feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li>Your face will look and feel amazing</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>For this job, I prefer Philosophy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfect,&amp;#34; which is consistently effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>After watching some videos on Youtube showing how to properly use this stuff, I now very lightly tap it over my oily spots instead and it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I have reordered it now many times, and will continue to.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect product to control my oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>To use you rub the sponge along the top pf the product and blot it onto your skin.</li>
            <li>I love Mally and this product delivers.  </li>
            <li>okay, dries my skin out</li>
            <li>Still, I love this purchase and would recommend it to all with oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and make your skin look more even and put together.</li>
            <li>Clean, healthy, beautiful, easy, lasting.</li>
            <li>It makes my face flawless and keeps my look all day long!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This extends the life of your makeup in those huge pore areas that tend to get oily and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I work at a daycare primarily in the infants room and every now</li>
            <li>The only thing I could complain about is that fact that the Face Defender compact doesn&#x27;t hold the sponge ... but that can be overlooked because that stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I originally saw it on QVC.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my make up looking fresh all day!</li>
            <li>The product inside is worth it, but its packaging is sorely lacking.</li>
            <li>with oily skin, my make up stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>because moisturizing before just makes me look like a greaseball right from the start.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this takes the shine right off my face and when I get home</li>
            <li>I love this product, removes the shine for hours, just gently press w/ sponge to shine area, actually use on entire face, feels amazing.</li>
            <li>When you apply liquid foundation, you may want to do this first and then work on your hair so it has a time to set IF that&#x27;s the routine you choose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really it!  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my face matte and fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly oily skin, and mid-day if I use this to touchup my makeup stays oil-free for at least a few more hours.</li>
            <li>and I really like it...</li>
            <li>Packaging is the real drawback.</li>
            <li>Really works on oily skin.</li>
            <li>but for me I could see it sitting on my very oily skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this Mally&#x27;s Face Defender at ULTA and have been using it for a few weeks now, and so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>My only complaints: it is rather expensive and the compact should REALLY be able to hold the sponge!!!</li>
            <li>Looks great on a counter at home, but when travelling with it in my purse I find it awkward and large.</li>
            <li>The silicone-like \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in the compact and the thick sponge really seem to soak up oil that already exists on my face magically, plus prevents the oil from returning for hours longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and mattifies your skin</li>
            <li>I like that this is clear</li>
            <li>The amount of product will probably last me a whole year</li>
            <li>I hesitated for a pretty long time before purchasing this but it left my skin very flaky looking.</li>
            <li>This is a clear solid that you put on</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a silky, solid clear deodorant.</li>
            <li>I will say the first time I used this I assumed that I needed to firmly press the sponge onto my face to get the stuff into my pores, which left a very noticeable chalky white residue on my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> a far cry from the oil slick it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so at times my skin can be dry and other times a bit oily.</li>
            <li> Take the time to look at Mally&#x27;s videos before you apply anything, she provides you with the proper techniques &amp; if you look hard enough, you&#x27;ll find a promo code!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually does what it says.  </li>
            <li> After having this for a few months the inside dish that holds the actual product broke out.</li>
            <li> and then I float to the other rooms.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY oily skin and was using blotting papers about 4 times throughout the day, and by evening I would look like I didn&#x27;t even have makeup on anymore.</li>
            <li> Just not right for my skin texture, I guess.</li>
            <li> But those babies are WORK because we&#x27;re writing everything down, cleaning up and feeding babies, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually just apply Primer and then foundation</li>
            <li> , the oil on my face is usually trying to make its debut ...</li>
            <li> I found that this was certainly no better than powder.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy oily skin, and this is THE only product that can keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this stuff in the morning and then once again late in the afternoon</li>
            <li> &amp; maybe I&#x27;m being a little dramatic</li>
            <li> It came broken.  </li>
            <li> The sponge does not fit into the compact, so you can probably imagine how dirty it gets inside of your purse or make-up bag.</li>
            <li> and you can use it over your existing foundation, BUT the design of the product is a fail.</li>
            <li> It can get crazy in there</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It came broken.  Haven&#x27;t used and the product is falling apart.</li>
            <li> I have crazy oily skin, and this is THE only product that can keep it under control.  Oddly enough, I don&#x27;t care for it when used over my make-up.  I prefer to dab a little on clean skin and then continue with my usual make-up routine.  By day&#x27;s end, my skin looks a bit \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;... a far cry from the oil slick it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the claims... minimizes pores, diffuses the look of lines... maybe a bit?  But honestly, I don&#x27;t care.  I was looking for oil control, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It is light weight and make your skin look more even and put together. I love it!</li>
            <li> Every time I apply liquid foundation, this stuff is a MUST. I have combination skin so at times my skin can be dry and other times a bit oily. I usually just apply Primer and then foundation because moisturizing before just makes me look like a greaseball right from the start. When you apply liquid foundation, you may want to do this first and then work on your hair so it has a time to set IF that&#x27;s the routine you choose. I usually would like to do my hair first and then my makeup so I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating to death over fighting with my hair after doing my face lol. I work at a daycare primarily in the infants room and every now and then I float to the other rooms. But those babies are WORK because we&#x27;re writing everything down, cleaning up and feeding babies, etc. It can get crazy in there and I&#x27;ve only been there a couple months and have yet to see a room with 12 babies in it lol. Anyway, this takes the shine right off my face and when I get home I look the same as I did when I left the house before work so I&#x27;m all about it. I bought two. one for my purse and one for home!</li>
            <li> have used this for sometime and I really like it...&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
            <li> I love this product, removes the shine for hours, just gently press w/ sponge to shine area, actually use on entire face, feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years. I originally saw it on QVC. Since then, I order from Amazon (since I have Prime).</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually does what it says.  I have reordered it now many times, and will continue to.  Makes your skin look and feel flawless.  I have recommended this product to all my friends</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It&#x27;s clear and mattifies your skin and you can use it over your existing foundation, BUT the design of the product is a fail. The sponge does not fit into the compact, so you can probably imagine how dirty it gets inside of your purse or make-up bag. I don&#x27;t know what these people were thinking designing something like this. A sponge picks up dirt, lint and bacteria that is transferred to your skin. I&#x27;ve had mine for a long time and I will consider purchasing again if they change the design.</li>
            <li> This product is a godsend! ORDER FROM MALLYBEAUTY.COM ... PURCHASE THE &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL SKIN PREP&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll get 2 full-sized products (Primer &amp; Face Defender) for the price of one &amp; they both make your face feel and look amazing. I&#x27;m sitting here at work &amp; at this point, the oil on my face is usually trying to make its debut ... but today, NOT A SIGN OF IT! I think I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect product to control my oily skin &amp; maybe I&#x27;m being a little dramatic but these products are THAT good. Your face will look and feel amazing &amp; I&#x27;m pretty confident that this will hold up after a night of dancing!!! The only thing I could complain about is that fact that the Face Defender compact doesn&#x27;t hold the sponge ... but that can be overlooked because that stuff is AMAZING! Take the time to look at Mally&#x27;s videos before you apply anything, she provides you with the proper techniques &amp; if you look hard enough, you&#x27;ll find a promo code! &amp;#34;WELOVEYOU&amp;#34; for $10 off worked for me ... TRY THIS! If you have oily skin like me, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great product - my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> This extends the life of your makeup in those huge pore areas that tend to get oily and noticeable. This is a clear solid that you put on and it keeps your makeup in place all day and night. Love Mally prouducts just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Just not right for my skin texture, I guess. It didn&#x27;t seem to do what I needed, which is smoothing and setting the surface so makeup looks great on it. For this job, I prefer Philosophy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfect,&amp;#34; which is consistently effective.</li>
            <li> this cant be beat...i have oily skin and this is a must every day</li>
            <li> This is it!  It&#x27;s really it!  Clean, healthy, beautiful, easy, lasting.</li>
            <li> I saw this on some talk show and after reading all of the reviews decided to try it.  I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.  It&#x27;s just okay.  I think I will stick with Clinique Pore Minimizer from now on.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I have incredibly oily skin, and mid-day if I use this to touchup my makeup stays oil-free for at least a few more hours. It reminds me of a silky, solid clear deodorant. To use you rub the sponge along the top pf the product and blot it onto your skin. If you use too much it leave a faint white residue that settles into skin shortly thereafter and looks clear. Packaging is the real drawback. Looks great on a counter at home, but when travelling with it in my purse I find it awkward and large. Also, the sponge is not connected so it just hangs out by itself (unsanitary). After having this for a few months the inside dish that holds the actual product broke out. It goes back it, but having to glue things I by back together is a bummer. The product inside is worth it, but its packaging is sorely lacking.</li>
            <li> Really works on oily skin. Mally, please make a sponge that fits in the compact.</li>
            <li> I love Mally and this product delivers.  It makes my face flawless and keeps my look all day long!!!!!!  It is absolutely amazing.  A must buy.</li>
            <li> I like that this is clear and I don&#x27;t need to worry about color matching. The only &#x27;makeup&#x27; I do on the daily basis is to fill in my brows and line my upper eyelid and I don&#x27;t wear foundation at all. I have relatively oily skin so pat this product onto my face (T zone area) as the last step and it keeps my face matte and fresh the whole day. The amount of product will probably last me a whole year and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Chalky texture when I put it on.  I found that this was certainly no better than powder.  It leaves a white chalky like residue.  I don&#x27;t care for this product/</li>
            <li> I hesitated for a pretty long time before purchasing this but it left my skin very flaky looking. There were chalky residues that makes the face look unnatural. I like the sponge it came with though and that&#x27;s about it. So 2 stars because of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I wished this would have been a miracle product but for me I could see it sitting on my very oily skin, wasnt a good look. Love the concept!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and does what is claims - covers pores perfectly without that powdery look and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The best thing for oily skin and your makeup never comes off.</li>
            <li> this is great for women who don&#x27;t want to use face powder but want to set their makeup and remove the shine! It helps keep my make up looking fresh all day!</li>
            <li> okay, dries my skin out</li>
            <li> I purchased this Mally&#x27;s Face Defender at ULTA and have been using it for a few weeks now, and so far I&#x27;m loving it. I have EXTREMELY oily skin and was using blotting papers about 4 times throughout the day, and by evening I would look like I didn&#x27;t even have makeup on anymore.

The silicone-like \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in the compact and the thick sponge really seem to soak up oil that already exists on my face magically, plus prevents the oil from returning for hours longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before. I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup and face look so much better at the end of the workday now! I will say the first time I used this I assumed that I needed to firmly press the sponge onto my face to get the stuff into my pores, which left a very noticeable chalky white residue on my face. After watching some videos on Youtube showing how to properly use this stuff, I now very lightly tap it over my oily spots instead and it works perfectly for me. My only complaints: it is rather expensive and the compact should REALLY be able to hold the sponge!!! Still, I love this purchase and would recommend it to all with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love this....works best on tv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product. Please...Never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;Even with oily skin, my make up stays fresh all day. And yes, even my&lt;br /&gt;pores are diminished.</li>
