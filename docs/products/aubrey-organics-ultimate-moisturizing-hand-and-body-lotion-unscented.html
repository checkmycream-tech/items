            <li>Great lotion!</li>
            <li>This lotion is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>this lotion is awesome...</li>
            <li>Best lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Best moisturizing lotion I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This used to be a great product but they changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate, feels great, and even improves your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not that happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Aubrey.</li>
            <li>I figured it was time to share a good review for it.</li>
            <li>the product is of good quality , as Aubrey&#x27;s products always are, but  I was looking forward to a no scent moisturizer to add my own aroma therapy oils to it -</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like glue.  </li>
            <li>; lotions I have tried, this is by far the best one there is.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin  and the unscented is perfect for me///plus it doesn&#x27;;t compete with my fragrance.</li>
            <li>Also it does not contain any chemicals like parabens that are found in most lotions.  </li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are not organic.</li>
            <li>I like to use it all over before I jump in the shower because it just seems to work EVEN better that way.  </li>
            <li>By the way, Whole Foods sells it now, and if you order $30 worth of awesome stuff from the Aubrey website</li>
            <li>I have many skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels fantastic on my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, so this lotion is a great option for me.  </li>
            <li>but this moisturizer has a strong dominant scent .</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to many added aromas and &amp;#34;natural fragrances&amp;#34; in health care products and happy to finally have a good unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li>you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is unscented and works well for fair sensitive irritated skin...</li>
            <li>I would say its a moisturizer that I reach for mostly in the hot summer months when a lighter moisturizer is needed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good, unscented lotion when I found this at my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, however.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice basic light moisturizer for body or face...</li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing goes, this is a fine product, though--in my experience--the unscented Acure lotion does a slightly better job and get completely absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tried several brands of lotion and none of them worked for my dry skin until I tried Aubrey and the best of all is organic.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $10</li>
            <li>The smell absorbs right away, however.  </li>
            <li>My arms would swell and get red and hot from popular OTC brand lotions.  </li>
            <li>The new product is mostly alcohol and contains tocopheryl acetate a synthetic form of vitamin-e that many people have allergic reactions to, among other health risks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the last year and just got more.</li>
            <li>I have liked other products from this company.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is suitable for winter when a thicker product is needed for very very dry skin...</li>
            <li>It is almost completely organic and no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I am super sensitive to chemicals and fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I am also VERY picky about the ingredients in products I use.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in well and is not greasy but very hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it feels going on my skin; thick but absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Together, the ingredients have a pleasant, sweet smell that vaguely reminds me of sugar cookies.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The Aubrey leaves a little more of a residue.  </li>
            <li>This is great for moisturizing the body but has a strange odor that makes it impossible for me to use it on my hands, which is why I cannot give it more stars.</li>
            <li>The bottles with the newer style dispenser (flat top) has this strange smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of Bubble and Bee organic&#x27;s lotions and they are either too greasy or hard to apply (becuase they are solid like a soap) or they smell so good that bugs/bees seem to be attracted to you.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The ONLY downside is that, at first, it smells like oatmeal, or musty, but that soon subsides.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I was hoping to like it because it&#x27;s all natural, but there is no way I can wear this.</li>
            <li>I have also used this on my 1 year old boy almost since birth.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re REALLY sensitive, you should note that this product isn&#x27;t completely neutral-smelling.  </li>
            <li>Again, thank you Amazon, for selling another quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I was using a new cream on my neck, and my skin became red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>The previous reviewer was right.</li>
            <li>With that being said, there&#x27;s about 20 ingredients and only 4 are marked</li>
            <li>is the only Aubrey Organics item I have purchased, and so far I think they&#x27;re a brand</li>

            <li> Aubrey Organics lotion has none of the above problems I&#x27;ve noticed with other non-chemical lotions.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed - based on the positive reviews, I expected something much better.</li>
            <li> well so there isn&#x27;t a greasy or clammy wet feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I ONLY buy Aubrey products for my personal needs, and while I also like their collagen moisturizer, this unscented one is usually a smidge less costly, so I buy it whenever I see the price has dropped.</li>
            <li> I been told I smell like maple syrup by more than one person.  :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust the ingredients in other lotions.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one and was VERY disappointed when I tried it the first time - it STINKS in a way that is much more offensive than my old scented lotions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for three years and late last year, the odor went from almost unscented to a glue-like or plastic smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I have received the wrong item the last two times ordered this.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and moisturizes</li>
            <li> I also hate how little comes out when you pump it.</li>
            <li> It smells DISGUSTING!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like everything about this lotion except the smell.  It kind of smells like glue.  I have liked other products from this company.  I will probably try the scented version of this product next time.</li>
            <li> Although I bought it because it said there was no smell.  It does have a strange smell to it.  I been told I smell like maple syrup by more than one person.  :(</li>
            <li> I like this lotion.  It has a faint smell of almonds and I love almonds.  Also it does not contain any chemicals like parabens that are found in most lotions.  I&#x27;ve tried some of Bubble and Bee organic&#x27;s lotions and they are either too greasy or hard to apply (becuase they are solid like a soap) or they smell so good that bugs/bees seem to be attracted to you.&lt;br /&gt;This Aubrey Organics lotion has none of the above problems I&#x27;ve noticed with other non-chemical lotions.  It is a lot easier to apply and healthier for your body(since your body does absorb what you put on it) than lotions at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> The previous reviewer was right. This smells like a gross version of maple syrup. It smells DISGUSTING! It&#x27;s also making my skin itch. I was hoping to like it because it&#x27;s all natural, but there is no way I can wear this. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for three years and late last year, the odor went from almost unscented to a glue-like or plastic smell.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  The bottles with the newer style dispenser (flat top) has this strange smell.  The bottles with the older-style dispenser, as depicted in Amazon&#x27;s photo, doesn&#x27;t exhibit the strange odor.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I ONLY buy Aubrey products for my personal needs, and while I also like their collagen moisturizer, this unscented one is usually a smidge less costly, so I buy it whenever I see the price has dropped.</li>
            <li> This used to be a great product but they changed the formula.  The new product is mostly alcohol and contains tocopheryl acetate a synthetic form of vitamin-e that many people have allergic reactions to, among other health risks. Most of the ingredients are not organic.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! I tried several brands of lotion and none of them worked for my dry skin until I tried Aubrey and the best of all is organic.</li>
            <li> This is great for moisturizing the body but has a strange odor that makes it impossible for me to use it on my hands, which is why I cannot give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive and dry skin and I am super sensitive to chemicals and fragrances.  I am also VERY picky about the ingredients in products I use.  This lotion is GREAT!  Of all the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotions I have tried, this is by far the best one there is.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate, feels great, and even improves your skin.  I like to use it all over before I jump in the shower because it just seems to work EVEN better that way.  If that&#x27;s even possible.  Well worth the $10 (although I&#x27;m not saying I wouldn&#x27;t like it to be cheaper).  By the way, Whole Foods sells it now, and if you order $30 worth of awesome stuff from the Aubrey website you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have many skin allergies.  My arms would swell and get red and hot from popular OTC brand lotions.  I found the Aubrey Organic Lotion on a site that recommended this lotion for those with skin allergies. I loved the way it feels going on my skin; thick but absorbs well. The ONLY downside is that, at first, it smells like oatmeal, or musty, but that soon subsides. I will continue to buy this lotion.  After weeks of using Aubrey Organics, I have had no allergic reactions at all!!  Again, thank you Amazon, for selling another quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I was using a new cream on my neck, and my skin became red and irritated.  I decided to try Aubrey Lotion instead, and all the redness disappeared in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic light moisturizer for body or face...I would say its a moisturizer that I reach for mostly in the hot summer months when a lighter moisturizer is needed. I don&#x27;t think it is suitable for winter when a thicker product is needed for very very dry skin...&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented and works well for fair sensitive irritated skin...</li>
            <li> I have always loved Aubrey. products...this lotion is awesome...I have sensitive skin  and the unscented is perfect for me///plus it doesn&#x27;;t compete with my fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what exactly it is that bugs me about this lotion but I think it is the texture. I also hate how little comes out when you pump it. I am not that happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels fantastic on my skin!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used.  I am very sensitive to many added aromas and &amp;#34;natural fragrances&amp;#34; in health care products and happy to finally have a good unscented lotion.  I have also used this on my 1 year old boy almost since birth.  I don&#x27;t trust the ingredients in other lotions.  Also seems to absorb into your skin well so there isn&#x27;t a greasy or clammy wet feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, so this lotion is a great option for me.  However, if you&#x27;re REALLY sensitive, you should note that this product isn&#x27;t completely neutral-smelling.  Together, the ingredients have a pleasant, sweet smell that vaguely reminds me of sugar cookies.  The smell absorbs right away, however.  As far as moisturizing goes, this is a fine product, though--in my experience--the unscented Acure lotion does a slightly better job and get completely absorbed quickly.  The Aubrey leaves a little more of a residue.  It&#x27;s not bad, however.  I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get an unscented lotion for at work, since I tend to work in a group setting and wanted a lotion that would not have a smell that is offensive to my coworkers.  I ordered this one and was VERY disappointed when I tried it the first time - it STINKS in a way that is much more offensive than my old scented lotions.  I plan on trying to return it, and if I can&#x27;t, I will simply throw it away.  Very disappointed - based on the positive reviews, I expected something much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! No oily feeling and absorbs into your skin I&#x27;ve used this for the last year and just got more. I figured it was time to share a good review for it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing lotion I have ever used!!! It soaks in well and is not greasy but very hydrating and moisturizing. It is almost completely organic and no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, unscented lotion when I found this at my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and moisturizes well. I like it, and will probably purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Organics\\&quot; is listed as part the name of the company, \\&quot;Aubrey Organics.\\&quot; They are not implying this lotion is 100% organic. With that being said, there&#x27;s about 20 ingredients and only 4 are marked organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the bottle says \\&quot;No Animal Testing\\&quot;, \\&quot;Vegan\\&quot; \\&quot;Contents Biodegradable\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Recyclable Container\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only Aubrey Organics item I have purchased, and so far I think they&#x27;re a brand I can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have received the wrong item the last two times ordered this.....</li>
            <li> the product is of good quality , as Aubrey&#x27;s products always are, but  I was looking forward to a no scent moisturizer to add my own aroma therapy oils to it - but this moisturizer has a strong dominant scent .</li>
