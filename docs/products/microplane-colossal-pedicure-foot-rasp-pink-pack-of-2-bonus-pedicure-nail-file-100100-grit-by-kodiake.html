            <li>My feet r in much better shape now!</li>
            <li>The size is great, and the curvature makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Amazing tool</li>
            <li>This product was amazing.</li>
            <li>but it does any amazing job on feet.</li>
            <li>I just got this amazing file and it took care of the calouses that have been building up.</li>
            <li>These files are amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Save your money if you&#x27;re eyeing that amazing looking but ineffective</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool and extremely effective.</li>
            <li>This file is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I liked it so well</li>
            <li>and I knew I needed my own</li>
            <li>it (probably not as cost effective).</li>
            <li>I use it on my own feet and my husbands.</li>
            <li>They are okay, not as good as the nail shop though.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t survive without this handy tool.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using a popular rasp that has been seen on tv.</li>
            <li>so I started doing my own.</li>
            <li>It is so effective at removing skin on your heels and any semi-thick skin that if you use it too often you can end up removing the layers of thicker skin that help protect your heel.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your heels could use a good scraping before using this again.</li>
            <li>I love being able to save money by giving myself my own pedicure!</li>
            <li>Works great and quick.</li>
            <li>The most amazing product for a person who has hyperkeratosis.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your feet feeling nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing thing you can use on your feet.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful and made my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>this is the best so far</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend, and I am impressed with how quick and easy it is to smooth the calluses on my heels.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>, however my feet have looked good throughout the summer!&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, so by and large</li>
            <li>Thanks to all others who have posted pictures and great reviews, now I own them.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best foot file I have found.</li>
            <li>It works like a magic.</li>
            <li>I love the way my feet look and feel afterwards</li>
            <li>- I am SO glad I bought this instead of the electric ones being shown on TV.</li>
            <li>Why spend $40 for a pedicure at the salon when you can literally get better results with this at home?  </li>
            <li>Just love</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>lol I&#x27;m ready for sandals</li>
            <li>These work so much better than the one I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply.</li>
            <li>Better results than the pedi egg</li>
            <li>Pedis and they have used this and always wanted to have one I love this item</li>
            <li>so glad I found a place to get it</li>
            <li>I have used a callus shaver for most of my life</li>
            <li>This is much better.  </li>
            <li>Works way better than the pedi-egg thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Would def recommend :)</li>
            <li>Love these .  </li>
            <li>LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li>One of the reviewers told a hilarious cautionary tale about being a bit over-zealous with the scraping</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>love the color as well.</li>
            <li>I will be a reoccurring customer :)</li>
            <li>better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Works great--even better with callus eliminator or sloughing lotion.</li>
            <li>I love these and that&#x27;s why I ordered them...</li>
            <li>I love my others.  </li>
            <li>And although I would love to put before &amp; after pics on here, the before might break the internet.  </li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that it files/removes skin in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this works much better than pediegg</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this foot file.  </li>
            <li>these pedicure foot rasps are the same ones that pedicurists use, so they are wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already worn out two of these over the years and have ordered two more and couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li>Outstanding results and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week or so and make sure to lotion up after using it.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It worked much better than just a pumice.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the dust capturing &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; but they do a way better job.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I saw the commercials for the Amope product and was very excited.</li>
            <li>It is safe and so easy to use....</li>
            <li>The instructions say it is best to use on dry feet, but can do either way.  </li>
            <li>super effective, and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, like using the callous razors.  </li>
            <li>I used it for all over my dry skin areas perfect tool....</li>
            <li>I immediately began to use it since instruction said it was best to use on dry feet.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much - I bought this two-pack to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I gave the 2nd one in the pack to my mom and she loved it as well!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold in your hand and to control.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best pedicure file I have EVER had (and that includes the ones that have been used on me during professional pedicures).</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cheaper than going to get a pedicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, and use.</li>
            <li>Easy does it though or you&#x27;ll be limping.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>all been doing our feet with these and our feet are looking great in our sandals... or just bare....  </li>
            <li>The BEST, hands down.  </li>
            <li>My feet are super smooth again!</li>
            <li>It is SO QUICK to use!  </li>
            <li>Works well scrubbing dead skin off, not the best I have ever used, but is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This just beats pedegg even when at its best because the microfilm are so smooth and it leaves your heels smooth rightaway, no need to sand them down afterwards.</li>
            <li>it is huge with a rubber grip</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic.</li>
            <li>but the results are amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>My salon uses this rasp for my pedicure and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smooth in no time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sloughing off dead skin from my heels</li>
            <li>I use this, then use a pumice stone to smooth out heels.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li>This file is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Maybe even too fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is way worth the money and way better than the pedegg, amope sander type things...</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sanitize too.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping dead skin off of heels.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic, they are just like the pros.</li>
            <li>However looked a week later it was there as always my come to place came through thanks Amazon and the place that carried this product we love it !!!!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work as good as the foot rasps that are used when you get a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Now, I am using this product once a week for almost one month and it really does a magic, like instantly satisfying result.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>It has improved the skin on my heels and significantly reduced my callous.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>BEST dead skin/ callus remover EVER!</li>
            <li>It is a very safe product that removes without fear of nicking sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>First, make sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li>This file works great to smooth rough heals and feet.</li>
            <li>I have never seen his feet so clean without callus.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my feet as soft as possible and this is the perfect tool!  </li>
            <li>In all seriousness, it does a great job keeping the dry skin at bay between pedicures.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing can&#x27;t say enough keep ordering them cause I gave too many</li>
            <li>I have been using revlon pumice stone once or twice a week for more than a year, and I really like it for how smooth it was making my foot feel</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new and this purchase was on of the best I have made in a long time</li>
            <li>Love the large size.</li>
            <li>Work amazingly well, and using too much can cause very sore feet!</li>
            <li>Then the bright idea hit me to get the same tool - and</li>
            <li>Its great, you have to be careful and my need a finishing buffer</li>
            <li>Neither of us are the soft foot kind.</li>
            <li>Curved handle would improve the tool for those with flexibility issues but overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective device I have purchased to deal with dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>By far the best dry use foot file.</li>
            <li>Great for sloughing off just the right amount of dry heels.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but always follow with a &#x27;fine&#x27; file.</li>
            <li>The Pedicure rasps are the easiest and most efficient way to make your feet baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have bought many, many different tools for my calauses.  </li>
            <li>I love getting pedicures because they always work magic on my feet - especially my horrid heels!  </li>
            <li>The two pack comes with two individually packaged files, which is perfect because I&#x27;m giving one away as a gift to my mom; she&#x27;s where I got my gross heels from in the first place!</li>
            <li>Much better than using a stone or other kind of instrument.</li>
            <li>I live in flip flops and love to garden.  </li>
            <li>a weekly pedicure from the salon didn&#x27;t help me much!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t overdo it the first time!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was hoping for!  </li>
            <li>It does a really good job of getting rid of all the dead skin, but it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li>lol... please be careful not to scrub too much off at once because your feet will feel like you got rug burns...</li>
            <li>heavy duty works great</li>
            <li>it removes the dead skin and reveals a happy foot.</li>
            <li>it works miracles on my feet more than a professional pedicure could ever do.  </li>
            <li>I soaked my feet in Epson salt for about 10 minutes covered the bottoms of my feet in the Callus eliminator for five minutes then wiped it off and then filed my feet with this micro plane colossal pedicure file.  </li>
            <li>It could have had a cover to catch the dead skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t make it any more effective than it already</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of money on foot products and this is by far my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Using it so soon after the last time I used it has made my heels tender and hurt from my own weight.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the ped egg and various other tools and this is way more effective - perhaps the handle gives you better leverage.  </li>
            <li>Used this for first time tonight - so easy and gentle on feet.</li>
            <li>It says so right on the package</li>
            <li>I have been using pedegg but the blades have gotten so blunt out of the box that I would buy replacement blades and would have to throw them out right away.</li>
            <li>It does the job right..</li>
            <li>and it comes right off</li>
            <li>I do use mine on dry feet like it suggests and this thing is a magic wand!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have ever purchased for my callouses and it works dry as well as wet.  </li>
            <li>This file is very easy to use and quickly clears away any dry skin on the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li>You barely have to apply any pressure for it to work its magic.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how I went so long without owning one of my own.</li>
            <li>Bought one of these for myself and loved it so much I bought 3 more for girlfriend, mum and Aunty....just be careful not to get to carried away because you don&#x27;t realize how much you are taking off as it shaves off such fine pieces...</li>
            <li>OK, that&#x27;s a little over the top</li>
            <li>right when I first get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have been picking my callused feet forever because I could never find the right tool to really get in there and do the job!</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to use them on dry skin, and they work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending so much money, so these are a great deal because I don&#x27;t need pedicures every few weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to file into sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>work&#x27;s great, just took a little too much skin off the first time.</li>
            <li>Just used the Microplane rasp for the first time along with the ProLinc Callus Eliminator and the result was amazing - it sloughed off my calluses and smoothed dry cracked heels with ease.  </li>
            <li>The instructions recommend using it on dry feet, although I personally have found that it is more effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the pediegg which worked great but became dull after filing my feet one time.</li>
            <li>No other at home product has done as good of a job with my heels, and I have tried them all on my gross feet.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this though it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>, I purchased another for my mom, who loves it every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li>The first time I seen this product was in the nail shop where I get my pedicures done.</li>
            <li>Wow this this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These do exactly what you want them to do.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>(Though this thing is of such industrial strength I think if I bought just a couple more</li>
            <li>Feet are left soft and smooth just be sure not to over scrape otherwise</li>
            <li>The bigger holes do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I really like these!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>They really work!  </li>
            <li>This is going to give you pretty feet...</li>
            <li>My mom &amp; dad had raved about it &amp; finally I tried theirs &amp; it has literally changed my feet for the better.  </li>
            <li>but this is great for thick callused heels.  </li>
            <li>The foot rasp makes your feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worked!</li>
            <li>the microplane rasp makes quick work of my callus removal and leaves my feet feeling like new in just minutes.  </li>
            <li>Pumice stones and every thing else does an okay job, but this is the only thing that will really get all the rough/dead skin off.</li>
            <li>This foot scrubber always leave my feet super soft!</li>
            <li>On the plus side the foot rasp works as described - nice and sharp, really takes off the callouses well.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as an electric one if not better</li>
            <li>I have tried every product/device under the sun that promises to remove the dreaded rough skin and calluses from the bottom of your feet and nothing works and quick or easy as this does.</li>
            <li>works great gets all that dry skin I like to use it dry!</li>
            <li>Love that I can use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li>Normally you would use something like this, followed by a pumice and then followed by some light sander to leave them soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall large size makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I think you should be careful though as thing could very easily take off too much and leave your feet very tender.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hesitate buy the two pack instead of the single a lot better value</li>
            <li>I stopped before I damaged myself but could easily see that one could take it a bit too far and soft</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, not painful and shaves the dead skin right off.  </li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I have had extremely cracked heels for many years and have tried every product out there on the market to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on tough calluses.  </li>
            <li>They work great on tough calousses.</li>
            <li>Very effective tool for removing rough dry skin.</li>
            <li>I just received this file today, this file is amazing, it took off all the dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>None of them really worked.</li>
            <li>The rasp works really well</li>
            <li>shaved off too much before I realized.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>Fast shipping greaaaaaaat product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It left my heels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have had this problem my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I think the blade was made in the USA but the whole thing was &amp;#34;assembled&amp;#34; in Mexico.</li>
            <li>Work really well</li>
            <li>I was dubious, but read the reviews and figured, what the heck, I&#x27;m not spending much $ if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>But this helps so much.</li>
            <li>but really does work a treat.</li>
            <li>This microplaner is to refine the calluses so that you can add lotion and be sandal ready.</li>
            <li>These files work very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a foot file rookie either, so I knew not to do too much.</li>
            <li>The difference will absolutely amaze you....  </li>
            <li>These microplanes work really well.</li>
            <li>Mr. Pumice - too much work&lt;br /&gt;Heel</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>My heels went from deep cavernous cracks that looked as though they had a fight with a wood chipper (and lost) to incredibly smooth</li>
            <li>You can really take skin off fast</li>
            <li>Needs to be repeated very often.</li>
            <li>This product is really helpful.  </li>
            <li>I wear sandals a lot and this product works very well on my feet.</li>
            <li>long handle easy to use</li>
            <li>i was able to gift the other.</li>
            <li>Much better than other products I have purchased</li>
            <li>It works better than any other lotions or files Combined, that I have used before.</li>
            <li>Definitely what was missing to keep my feet soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and make quick work of the tough hooves I have to call feet.</li>
            <li>but I cannot afford professional pedis, but this is pretty much what they do at the salons</li>
            <li>The pedicure foot files looked a little scratched up but still came in their own packages like new.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective way to remove hard dry skin from feet!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of products for smoothing my heels with very limited success.  </li>
            <li>They feel like brand new feet!  </li>
            <li>everyone should have one - guys too - easy to use (wet or dry) by by callous hello smooth feet</li>
            <li>heed everyone else&#x27;s warnings - Take it slow and make sure you check often that you aren&#x27;t scraping fresh skin.</li>
            <li>However, over the years the quality of that particular product had declined, so I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Best thing I have found for bad heals.</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes of use, it took off more of my calluses than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I just have to be sure to gently use them; once I filed too roughly and had a tiny area bleed.  </li>
            <li>but I would get rid of them instantly with my Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp.</li>
            <li>I see I see it lasting a very very long time does the job quickly safely</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>This really gets all the dead skin off your feet and leaves it silky smooth, A+.</li>
            <li>It just looked like a much larger version of the old Pedi-Egg (which kind of worked, but it was a lot of work for little effect).</li>
            <li>Covers more surface area and save you time with endless pumicing!!!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Just wow!....</li>
            <li>Use on clean dry feet to get the majority of dead stuff off your feet then you can do it again in the shower to get the excess of and smooth out.</li>
            <li>Minor drawback but worth mentioning for those that would have a problem with it.  </li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t need a professional again!  </li>
            <li>Unless you have a condition that causes excessive skin turn over, most people should not need to use this on a weekly or biweekly basis.  </li>
            <li>Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.by: A-Z NAIL SUPPLY Shipped by:</li>
            <li>Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.</li>
            <li>Soft soles need not apply!</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>Does work quickly, but I didn&#x27;t need to go super slow to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if a person can ever totally eliminate calluses, but this new microplane will make it much easier to keep them under control.</li>
            <li>Works really great they are smaller than the one I had previously which means it takes a little longer</li>
            <li>Please heed warning about taking it slow as it is easy to scrape off too much in one sitting.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to have soften feet from the shower either you can use right on dry feet.</li>
            <li>I was amazed as the tool quickly revealed baby-soft, pink feet!</li>
            <li>You can still take too much off, but at least it doesn&#x27;t come out in huge chunks.  </li>
            <li>Also, too big for nooks and crannies of your feet, but otherwise work really well.</li>
            <li>Looks like a cheese grater, very simple to use, and can make your feet sore if you do too much at one time.  </li>
            <li>This is a tool everyone should have at home either for DIY pedi&#x27;s or for those in between professional pedi appointments.</li>
            <li>Use common sense and don&#x27;t over file. :)</li>
            <li>It completely removed my callouses without hurting.</li>
            <li>and my feet were really sore the next day.</li>
            <li>The picture shows two pink microplane colossal pedicure&#x27;s and a bonus nail file.</li>
            <li>I received one pink and one brown micrplane colossal pedicure and did not receive the bonus file.</li>
            <li>Be careful or you could injure yourself, that&#x27;s how powerful these things are.  </li>
            <li>The microplane will easily file away the dead skin, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will also cut into your skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as sharp as it was the first day!</li>
            <li>This microplaner takes off the calluses and leaves them soft, no other tools needed!  </li>
            <li>every rasp that I came across had this exact same design, with the smaller holes.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not filing or pumicing for a long time to get smooth feet or to get the rough thicker skin you want off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a large surface area with a long sturdy handle</li>
            <li>I studied the reviews of this product and determined the positive reviews were sincere - the poor reviews seems to have resulted from customers not understanding the proper way to use the product.</li>
            <li>I always tried to use some other device for the in between times but nothing worked quite right.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d be surprised how much thick skin can easily file off.  </li>
            <li>The file is sharp enough to really do a good job of sloughing off the dead skin but not so sharp that you would have to worry about taking off too much skin.</li>
            <li>Does what it says, used on my husband, had to be careful not to take too much off though, didn&#x27;t want him to be sore-footed!</li>
            <li>Be careful not to take off too much skin!</li>
            <li>Must be careful not to take off too much at a time!</li>
            <li>Wow, I read the reviews, but didn&#x27;t think this rasp would be able to handle my tough calluses -</li>
            <li>I was afraid of it at first, but after using it carefully a few times I am more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the PedEgg - this rasp makes it SOOOOOO much easier to remove the yucky dry skin on my feet..</li>
            <li>I tend to use it dry because then I can see how much skin is falling off - sounds</li>
            <li>Every where I go for a professional pedicure, the holes in the rasps are considerable bigger.</li>
            <li>It scrapes your calloused feet like no other.  </li>
            <li>Only need a professional pedi every once in a while!</li>
            <li>A gentle and quick way to remove calluses and dead skin carefully.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, do not dig to deeply, feet are soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Really help with my rough heels.  </li>
            <li>Be careful that you don&#x27;t remove too much skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely saves money because you can skip a pedicure but still have soft heels.</li>
            <li>Finally something that would give me the soft feet of my dreams...</li>
            <li>bare all your body weight, they need thicker skin for protection.  </li>
            <li>I 1,000 times recommend this tool, especially in conjunction with the professional grade callus remover (you will need a cheaper board type file for that) and the nuskin epoch heel cream.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to remove to much skin.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use, due to their over-sized shape.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item, but use care to not be too aggressive in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li>The only real way to remove callouses and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really takes off the rough, dry skin and leaves your heels feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>Other than that, these work really well and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Definite beat the old &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; that does the similar thing.  </li>
            <li>I think I went a little over board the first time using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2 pack for when the other goes dull.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s easy to go too thin.  </li>
            <li>You want to do less than you think you should because you&#x27;ll still have some rough skin to use a pumice or other smooth exfoliator on.</li>
            <li>In less than a week I have new feet!  </li>
            <li>This thing is crazy amazing.</li>

            <li> Maybe not 100% as good as the salons ones</li>
            <li> I get laughed out of the pedicure place</li>
            <li> My feet have never looked this good.</li>

            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>

            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> My feet r in much better shape now!</li>
            <li> The size is great, and the curvature makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Amazing tool</li>
            <li> This product was amazing.</li>
            <li> but it does any amazing job on feet.</li>
            <li> I just got this amazing file and it took care of the calouses that have been building up.</li>
            <li> These files are amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Save your money if you&#x27;re eyeing that amazing looking but ineffective</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool and extremely effective.</li>
            <li> This file is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I liked it so well</li>
            <li> and I knew I needed my own</li>
            <li> it (probably not as cost effective).</li>
            <li> I use it on my own feet and my husbands.</li>
            <li> They are okay, not as good as the nail shop though.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t survive without this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using a popular rasp that has been seen on tv.</li>
            <li> so I started doing my own.</li>
            <li> It is so effective at removing skin on your heels and any semi-thick skin that if you use it too often you can end up removing the layers of thicker skin that help protect your heel.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your heels could use a good scraping before using this again.</li>
            <li> I love being able to save money by giving myself my own pedicure!</li>
            <li> Works great and quick.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product for a person who has hyperkeratosis.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your feet feeling nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing you can use on your feet.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful and made my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> this is the best so far</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, and I am impressed with how quick and easy it is to smooth the calluses on my heels.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> , however my feet have looked good throughout the summer!&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, so by and large</li>
            <li> Thanks to all others who have posted pictures and great reviews, now I own them.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best foot file I have found.</li>
            <li> It works like a magic.</li>
            <li> I love the way my feet look and feel afterwards</li>
            <li> - I am SO glad I bought this instead of the electric ones being shown on TV.</li>
            <li> Why spend $40 for a pedicure at the salon when you can literally get better results with this at home?  </li>
            <li> Just love</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> lol I&#x27;m ready for sandals</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the one I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Better results than the pedi egg</li>
            <li> Pedis and they have used this and always wanted to have one I love this item</li>
            <li> so glad I found a place to get it</li>
            <li> I have used a callus shaver for most of my life</li>
            <li> This is much better.  </li>
            <li> Works way better than the pedi-egg thing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Would def recommend :)</li>
            <li> Love these .  </li>
            <li> LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers told a hilarious cautionary tale about being a bit over-zealous with the scraping</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> love the color as well.</li>
            <li> I will be a reoccurring customer :)</li>
            <li> better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Works great--even better with callus eliminator or sloughing lotion.</li>
            <li> I love these and that&#x27;s why I ordered them...</li>
            <li> I love my others.  </li>
            <li> And although I would love to put before &amp; after pics on here, the before might break the internet.  </li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that it files/removes skin in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this works much better than pediegg</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this foot file.  </li>
            <li> these pedicure foot rasps are the same ones that pedicurists use, so they are wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already worn out two of these over the years and have ordered two more and couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> Outstanding results and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week or so and make sure to lotion up after using it.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It worked much better than just a pumice.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the dust capturing &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; but they do a way better job.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercials for the Amope product and was very excited.</li>
            <li> It is safe and so easy to use....</li>
            <li> The instructions say it is best to use on dry feet, but can do either way.  </li>
            <li> super effective, and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, like using the callous razors.  </li>
            <li> I used it for all over my dry skin areas perfect tool....</li>
            <li> I immediately began to use it since instruction said it was best to use on dry feet.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much - I bought this two-pack to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I gave the 2nd one in the pack to my mom and she loved it as well!</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold in your hand and to control.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best pedicure file I have EVER had (and that includes the ones that have been used on me during professional pedicures).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cheaper than going to get a pedicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, and use.</li>
            <li> Easy does it though or you&#x27;ll be limping.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> all been doing our feet with these and our feet are looking great in our sandals... or just bare....  </li>
            <li> The BEST, hands down.  </li>
            <li> My feet are super smooth again!</li>
            <li> It is SO QUICK to use!  </li>
            <li> Works well scrubbing dead skin off, not the best I have ever used, but is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This just beats pedegg even when at its best because the microfilm are so smooth and it leaves your heels smooth rightaway, no need to sand them down afterwards.</li>
            <li> it is huge with a rubber grip</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic.</li>
            <li> but the results are amazingly smooth.</li>

            <li> Smooth in no time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sloughing off dead skin from my heels</li>
            <li> I use this, then use a pumice stone to smooth out heels.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li> This file is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Maybe even too fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is way worth the money and way better than the pedegg, amope sander type things...</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and sanitize too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping dead skin off of heels.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic, they are just like the pros.</li>
            <li> However looked a week later it was there as always my come to place came through thanks Amazon and the place that carried this product we love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work as good as the foot rasps that are used when you get a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Now, I am using this product once a week for almost one month and it really does a magic, like instantly satisfying result.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> It has improved the skin on my heels and significantly reduced my callous.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> BEST dead skin/ callus remover EVER!</li>
            <li> It is a very safe product that removes without fear of nicking sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> First, make sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li> This file works great to smooth rough heals and feet.</li>
            <li> I have never seen his feet so clean without callus.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my feet as soft as possible and this is the perfect tool!  </li>
            <li> In all seriousness, it does a great job keeping the dry skin at bay between pedicures.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing can&#x27;t say enough keep ordering them cause I gave too many</li>
            <li> I have been using revlon pumice stone once or twice a week for more than a year, and I really like it for how smooth it was making my foot feel</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new and this purchase was on of the best I have made in a long time</li>
            <li> Love the large size.</li>
            <li> Work amazingly well, and using too much can cause very sore feet!</li>
            <li> Then the bright idea hit me to get the same tool - and</li>
            <li> Its great, you have to be careful and my need a finishing buffer</li>
            <li> Neither of us are the soft foot kind.</li>
            <li> Curved handle would improve the tool for those with flexibility issues but overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective device I have purchased to deal with dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> By far the best dry use foot file.</li>
            <li> Great for sloughing off just the right amount of dry heels.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but always follow with a &#x27;fine&#x27; file.</li>
            <li> The Pedicure rasps are the easiest and most efficient way to make your feet baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have bought many, many different tools for my calauses.  </li>
            <li> I love getting pedicures because they always work magic on my feet - especially my horrid heels!  </li>
            <li> The two pack comes with two individually packaged files, which is perfect because I&#x27;m giving one away as a gift to my mom; she&#x27;s where I got my gross heels from in the first place!</li>
            <li> Much better than using a stone or other kind of instrument.</li>
            <li> I live in flip flops and love to garden.  </li>
            <li> a weekly pedicure from the salon didn&#x27;t help me much!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t overdo it the first time!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was hoping for!  </li>
            <li> It does a really good job of getting rid of all the dead skin, but it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li> lol... please be careful not to scrub too much off at once because your feet will feel like you got rug burns...</li>
            <li> heavy duty works great</li>
            <li> it removes the dead skin and reveals a happy foot.</li>
            <li> it works miracles on my feet more than a professional pedicure could ever do.  </li>
            <li> I soaked my feet in Epson salt for about 10 minutes covered the bottoms of my feet in the Callus eliminator for five minutes then wiped it off and then filed my feet with this micro plane colossal pedicure file.  </li>
            <li> It could have had a cover to catch the dead skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t make it any more effective than it already</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money on foot products and this is by far my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Using it so soon after the last time I used it has made my heels tender and hurt from my own weight.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the ped egg and various other tools and this is way more effective - perhaps the handle gives you better leverage.  </li>
            <li> Used this for first time tonight - so easy and gentle on feet.</li>
            <li> It says so right on the package</li>
            <li> I have been using pedegg but the blades have gotten so blunt out of the box that I would buy replacement blades and would have to throw them out right away.</li>
            <li> It does the job right..</li>
            <li> and it comes right off</li>
            <li> I do use mine on dry feet like it suggests and this thing is a magic wand!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased for my callouses and it works dry as well as wet.  </li>
            <li> This file is very easy to use and quickly clears away any dry skin on the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li> You barely have to apply any pressure for it to work its magic.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how I went so long without owning one of my own.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for myself and loved it so much I bought 3 more for girlfriend, mum and Aunty....just be careful not to get to carried away because you don&#x27;t realize how much you are taking off as it shaves off such fine pieces...</li>
            <li> OK, that&#x27;s a little over the top</li>
            <li> right when I first get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have been picking my callused feet forever because I could never find the right tool to really get in there and do the job!</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to use them on dry skin, and they work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending so much money, so these are a great deal because I don&#x27;t need pedicures every few weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to file into sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> work&#x27;s great, just took a little too much skin off the first time.</li>
            <li> Just used the Microplane rasp for the first time along with the ProLinc Callus Eliminator and the result was amazing - it sloughed off my calluses and smoothed dry cracked heels with ease.  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommend using it on dry feet, although I personally have found that it is more effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the pediegg which worked great but became dull after filing my feet one time.</li>
            <li> No other at home product has done as good of a job with my heels, and I have tried them all on my gross feet.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought this though it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> , I purchased another for my mom, who loves it every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li> The first time I seen this product was in the nail shop where I get my pedicures done.</li>
            <li> Wow this this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> These do exactly what you want them to do.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> (Though this thing is of such industrial strength I think if I bought just a couple more</li>
            <li> Feet are left soft and smooth just be sure not to over scrape otherwise</li>
            <li> The bigger holes do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I really like these!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> They really work!  </li>
            <li> This is going to give you pretty feet...</li>
            <li> My mom &amp; dad had raved about it &amp; finally I tried theirs &amp; it has literally changed my feet for the better.  </li>
            <li> but this is great for thick callused heels.  </li>
            <li> The foot rasp makes your feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worked!</li>
            <li> the microplane rasp makes quick work of my callus removal and leaves my feet feeling like new in just minutes.  </li>

            <li> This is just as good as an electric one if not better</li>
            <li> I have tried every product/device under the sun that promises to remove the dreaded rough skin and calluses from the bottom of your feet and nothing works and quick or easy as this does.</li>
            <li> works great gets all that dry skin I like to use it dry!</li>
            <li> Love that I can use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li> Normally you would use something like this, followed by a pumice and then followed by some light sander to leave them soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall large size makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I think you should be careful though as thing could very easily take off too much and leave your feet very tender.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hesitate buy the two pack instead of the single a lot better value</li>
            <li> I stopped before I damaged myself but could easily see that one could take it a bit too far and soft</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, not painful and shaves the dead skin right off.  </li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have had extremely cracked heels for many years and have tried every product out there on the market to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on tough calluses.  </li>

            <li> The rasp works really well</li>
            <li> shaved off too much before I realized.</li>

            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It left my heels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had this problem my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I think the blade was made in the USA but the whole thing was &amp;#34;assembled&amp;#34; in Mexico.</li>
            <li> Work really well</li>
            <li> I was dubious, but read the reviews and figured, what the heck, I&#x27;m not spending much $ if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> But this helps so much.</li>
            <li> but really does work a treat.</li>
            <li> This microplaner is to refine the calluses so that you can add lotion and be sandal ready.</li>
            <li> These files work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a foot file rookie either, so I knew not to do too much.</li>
            <li> The difference will absolutely amaze you....  </li>
            <li> These microplanes work really well.</li>
            <li> Mr. Pumice - too much work&lt;br /&gt;Heel</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> My heels went from deep cavernous cracks that looked as though they had a fight with a wood chipper (and lost) to incredibly smooth</li>
            <li> You can really take skin off fast</li>
            <li> Needs to be repeated very often.</li>
            <li> This product is really helpful.  </li>
            <li> I wear sandals a lot and this product works very well on my feet.</li>
            <li> long handle easy to use</li>
            <li> i was able to gift the other.</li>
            <li> Much better than other products I have purchased</li>
            <li> It works better than any other lotions or files Combined, that I have used before.</li>
            <li> Definitely what was missing to keep my feet soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and make quick work of the tough hooves I have to call feet.</li>
            <li> but I cannot afford professional pedis, but this is pretty much what they do at the salons</li>
            <li> The pedicure foot files looked a little scratched up but still came in their own packages like new.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective way to remove hard dry skin from feet!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of products for smoothing my heels with very limited success.  </li>
            <li> They feel like brand new feet!  </li>
            <li> everyone should have one - guys too - easy to use (wet or dry) by by callous hello smooth feet</li>
            <li> heed everyone else&#x27;s warnings - Take it slow and make sure you check often that you aren&#x27;t scraping fresh skin.</li>
            <li> However, over the years the quality of that particular product had declined, so I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for bad heals.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes of use, it took off more of my calluses than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be sure to gently use them; once I filed too roughly and had a tiny area bleed.  </li>
            <li> but I would get rid of them instantly with my Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp.</li>
            <li> I see I see it lasting a very very long time does the job quickly safely</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> This really gets all the dead skin off your feet and leaves it silky smooth, A+.</li>
            <li> It just looked like a much larger version of the old Pedi-Egg (which kind of worked, but it was a lot of work for little effect).</li>
            <li> Covers more surface area and save you time with endless pumicing!!!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Just wow!....</li>
            <li> Use on clean dry feet to get the majority of dead stuff off your feet then you can do it again in the shower to get the excess of and smooth out.</li>
            <li> Minor drawback but worth mentioning for those that would have a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t need a professional again!  </li>
            <li> Unless you have a condition that causes excessive skin turn over, most people should not need to use this on a weekly or biweekly basis.  </li>
            <li> Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.by: A-Z NAIL SUPPLY Shipped by:</li>
            <li> Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.</li>
            <li> Soft soles need not apply!</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> Does work quickly, but I didn&#x27;t need to go super slow to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a person can ever totally eliminate calluses, but this new microplane will make it much easier to keep them under control.</li>
            <li> Works really great they are smaller than the one I had previously which means it takes a little longer</li>
            <li> Please heed warning about taking it slow as it is easy to scrape off too much in one sitting.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have soften feet from the shower either you can use right on dry feet.</li>
            <li> I was amazed as the tool quickly revealed baby-soft, pink feet!</li>
            <li> You can still take too much off, but at least it doesn&#x27;t come out in huge chunks.  </li>
            <li> Also, too big for nooks and crannies of your feet, but otherwise work really well.</li>
            <li> Looks like a cheese grater, very simple to use, and can make your feet sore if you do too much at one time.  </li>
            <li> This is a tool everyone should have at home either for DIY pedi&#x27;s or for those in between professional pedi appointments.</li>
            <li> Use common sense and don&#x27;t over file. :)</li>
            <li> It completely removed my callouses without hurting.</li>
            <li> and my feet were really sore the next day.</li>
            <li> The picture shows two pink microplane colossal pedicure&#x27;s and a bonus nail file.</li>
            <li> I received one pink and one brown micrplane colossal pedicure and did not receive the bonus file.</li>
            <li> Be careful or you could injure yourself, that&#x27;s how powerful these things are.  </li>
            <li> The microplane will easily file away the dead skin, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will also cut into your skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as sharp as it was the first day!</li>
            <li> This microplaner takes off the calluses and leaves them soft, no other tools needed!  </li>
            <li> every rasp that I came across had this exact same design, with the smaller holes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not filing or pumicing for a long time to get smooth feet or to get the rough thicker skin you want off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a large surface area with a long sturdy handle</li>
            <li> I studied the reviews of this product and determined the positive reviews were sincere - the poor reviews seems to have resulted from customers not understanding the proper way to use the product.</li>
            <li> I always tried to use some other device for the in between times but nothing worked quite right.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d be surprised how much thick skin can easily file off.  </li>
            <li> The file is sharp enough to really do a good job of sloughing off the dead skin but not so sharp that you would have to worry about taking off too much skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, used on my husband, had to be careful not to take too much off though, didn&#x27;t want him to be sore-footed!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to take off too much skin!</li>
            <li> Must be careful not to take off too much at a time!</li>
            <li> Wow, I read the reviews, but didn&#x27;t think this rasp would be able to handle my tough calluses -</li>
            <li> I was afraid of it at first, but after using it carefully a few times I am more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the PedEgg - this rasp makes it SOOOOOO much easier to remove the yucky dry skin on my feet..</li>
            <li> I tend to use it dry because then I can see how much skin is falling off - sounds</li>
            <li> Every where I go for a professional pedicure, the holes in the rasps are considerable bigger.</li>
            <li> It scrapes your calloused feet like no other.  </li>
            <li> Only need a professional pedi every once in a while!</li>
            <li> A gentle and quick way to remove calluses and dead skin carefully.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, do not dig to deeply, feet are soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Really help with my rough heels.  </li>
            <li> Be careful that you don&#x27;t remove too much skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely saves money because you can skip a pedicure but still have soft heels.</li>
            <li> Finally something that would give me the soft feet of my dreams...</li>
            <li> bare all your body weight, they need thicker skin for protection.  </li>
            <li> I 1,000 times recommend this tool, especially in conjunction with the professional grade callus remover (you will need a cheaper board type file for that) and the nuskin epoch heel cream.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to remove to much skin.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use, due to their over-sized shape.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item, but use care to not be too aggressive in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only real way to remove callouses and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It really takes off the rough, dry skin and leaves your heels feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> Other than that, these work really well and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Definite beat the old &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; that does the similar thing.  </li>
            <li> I think I went a little over board the first time using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2 pack for when the other goes dull.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s easy to go too thin.  </li>
            <li> You want to do less than you think you should because you&#x27;ll still have some rough skin to use a pumice or other smooth exfoliator on.</li>
            <li> In less than a week I have new feet!  </li>
            <li> This thing is crazy amazing.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and my feet - especially the heels - are really dry and cracked and this rasp took care of them in one major session and one follow up session the next day.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it can get a little messy and will require some clean up on your part when finished since there is nothing to catch the skin (like the ped egg).  </li>
            <li> I read previous reviews that said be careful not to take too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest going at least 3 weeks after the first time you use it before using it again.  </li>
            <li> so I have pretty thick calloused feet.</li>
            <li> Lots of dry skin  &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; falls on the floor so you actually have to sweep it up into a pile and get rid of it, unless you can figure out a way to do it over a wastebasket.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a few extras in the near future!</li>
            <li> They work incredibly well, and I have disgusting feet that crack and peel within days of getting a pedicure.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, if you get carried away you will have sore feet the next day.</li>
            <li> I mean it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could use this on wet or dry feet, but I use it while dry because (as gross as it is), I like to see the skin falling off</li>
            <li> Takes off calluses in no time and now my disgusting feet are gorgeous and baby soft again!....</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry skin before I shower.</li>
            <li> I had really dry and scaly heels for a while now and</li>
            <li> Helps my dry heels.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry heels</li>
            <li> Use it on DRY skin.</li>
            <li> My feet get really dry, even with slathering on creams.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my feet while they were dry, which is what the instructions says.</li>
            <li> It says to use on dry feet</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my heels</li>
            <li> I also tend to be too vigorous when I use it dry</li>
            <li> You use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li> Was suprised you use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li> Gets the dry calluses off with ease.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with how long you spend in 1 area of your heel, it will be tinder  the next day if you aren&#x27;t careful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> You have to be so careful because you don&#x27;t even realize how much dry skin this thing is removing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go crazy and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I have very dry rough skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t feel it until the next day and feel a little tender.  </li>
            <li> (I am only going to do a little at a time each night</li>
            <li> those little tiny things you buy in the drug store are pitiful...useless...  </li>
            <li> I heeded the advice before me to only do a little at a time so as to not wake up with sore feet.  </li>
            <li> but the metal seems to dull considerably after about 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Love these I have bad calluses</li>
            <li> my heels are still rough even after the callus remover is used.  </li>
            <li> All in all it took a total of about 12 minutes to get rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I soak my feet then use this tool while my feet are wet.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of 2 pink rasps but received one pink and one brown; no pedicure nail file was included.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful when using.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to remove every last bit of callus or dead skin from your feet at one time.</li>
            <li> Regular everyday foot files and ped egg did not faze it.</li>
            <li> I have flip-flop feet, and my husband b has military boot feet.</li>
            <li> Skin still stays rough.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful</li>
            <li> The only downside with this foot rasp is when the dead skin start to come again, I found it like needles</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> It gets all the dry skin in one treatment!!</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews I was thinking maybe they was just trying to push this product , not at all the this product will help anyone with rough feet plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the reviews and understood the positive reviews of the electric rollers were mainly fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Saves me from having to go get pedis as often as i used to due to being in an environment where i wear sandles all the time.</li>
            <li> So, be careful, but buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably be set up for baby-soft, pink feet for life!)  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need any other exfoliators.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as needed to rasp off those stubborn foot calluses.</li>
            <li> I usually sit on a little stool in front of the toilet and use it over the toilet to minimize cleanup afterward.</li>
            <li> so be very careful.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical, but it really worked well.</li>
            <li> so it is not too difficult to reach your feet if you aren&#x27;t very flexible.</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed by the size--this is the same size as my kitchen rasp--not small and narrow like other foot files I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Once I saw the results I couldn&#x27;t put it down.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp so when filing down skin remove a little at a time.</li>
            <li> If you need a lot of work do a little each day or every other day to give the underlying living skin time to adjust.</li>
            <li> This product did a fantastic job of filing down those nasty calluses I&#x27;ve developed over the years.  </li>
            <li> I use slight pressure and rub my heels and sides of feet.</li>
            <li> ; typically I will follow up by using a pumice stone after.</li>
            <li> Soak your feet in apple cider vinegar for a half hour before you use these</li>
            <li> I used it for less than 5 minutes on each foot</li>
            <li> If you want to have pretty feet and your feet are calloused and dry and ugly...</li>
            <li> No more retched rough feet.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s not motorized, but this baby takes so little effort to shave off years of callouses.</li>
            <li> Like grating a hard parmesan cheese, I thought while it immediately worked on the dry foot - no soaking required!  </li>
            <li> The dead skin literally just flakes off.</li>
            <li> My heels have thick layers of skin that are rough and sometimes crack.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re so fascinated by the dead skin coming off without any pressure or work,</li>
            <li> You would not believe how much dead akin it removes.</li>
            <li> Had cracked heels because I wear heels everyday and when not flip flops.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals everyday</li>
            <li> all my dead skin on my heels seemed to disappear&lt;</li>
            <li> you are going to buy anything dont waste your money on pediegg&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li> I was just going to test it for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I gave a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> This one just scratched my feet and didn&#x27;t scrape off any dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> These babies don&#x27;t mess around!</li>
            <li> The nasty just flies off, then just do a little fine tune smoothing with a pumice and  PAPOW!</li>
            <li> My mum has trouble work a lot because of hard places on her feat</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t come with a plastic cover like my old one which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting a small damp cloth underneath your feet when you do it and toss the towel into the washer.  </li>
            <li> It is a dead skin slougher!  </li>
            <li> I eagerly awaited the delivery, and when I first took it out I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Here is the difference, the holes in the rasp are fairly small.</li>
            <li> when you have calluses like I do, nothing else comes close because they are all so small they take forever to use (ped egg as example)</li>
            <li> I put a thick cream on my heels afterwards and wear footies for a few hours.</li>
            <li> No more picked raw feet and shredded sheets!</li>
            <li> A few revers have mentioned taking it slow and you should listen!</li>
            <li> shaver - blades rust &amp; dull</li>
            <li> at least you could use it for grating parmesan cheese (unlike a pumice stone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li> Does work well, and not as scary some of the other reviews made me think.</li>
            <li> I have had horribly calloused feet for my entire life due to going barefoot all the time, even up and down our gravel driveway when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I&#x27;m not going to post photos of my feet or dead skin.</li>
            <li> My feet&#x27;s callouses had callouses and they were extremely tough.</li>
            <li> Not a great combination for the skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a serious power tool!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that works for my horribly calloused feet.</li>
            <li> and I have had some terrible issues with cuts too deep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple of them because they seemed like they were different models, but all of foot rasps that I&#x27;ve bought in this style are terrible!</li>
            <li> My feet were in terrible condition with callouses, cracking and all sorts of dead skin build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this thing!</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Too bad I did not know about this product.</li>
            <li> Was shocked at the immediate difference.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated, and scoped out Amazon for yet another solution and came across this beauty.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t painful at all and doesn&#x27;t tickle you either.</li>
            <li> It was getting painful.</li>
            <li> Painful, and tears up your skin.</li>
            <li> I have horrible feet :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My feed are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Takes off the horrible cracked skin on our heels and toes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in flip flops and love to garden.  Not a great combination for the skin on my feet.  These were exactly what I was looking for.  Work great and quality appears to be good. Bought the second for my sister.</li>
            <li> The BEST, hands down.  This is the pedicure tool by which all others should aspire.</li>
            <li> This tool is addicting. I use it on my dry skin before I shower. I use slight pressure and rub my heels and sides of feet. The dead skin literally just flakes off. I apply lotion after shower and ta da...smooth feet!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. Love the large size. Love that I can use it on dry feet. After use I slather my feet with cocoa butter and put on a pair of socks and I have to say they have never been softer. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best foot file I have found. It is easy to hold in your hand and to control. The file is sharp enough to really do a good job of sloughing off the dead skin but not so sharp that you would have to worry about taking off too much skin.</li>
            <li> Best product for calloused feet ever!  It works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It exceeds my expectation.  It works like a magic. I cannot live without it. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally received product and it is as advertised.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase!!! I had really dry and scaly heels for a while now and a weekly pedicure from the salon didn&#x27;t help me much!! I decided to try something new and this purchase was on of the best I have made in a long time</li>
            <li> Does work well, and not as scary some of the other reviews made me think. Does work quickly, but I didn&#x27;t need to go super slow to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product for a person who has hyperkeratosis.  My heels have thick layers of skin that are rough and sometimes crack.  When I go to get a pedicure my heels are still rough even after the callus remover is used.  With this product, I use it effortlessly.  It is safe and so easy to use....it works miracles on my feet more than a professional pedicure could ever do.  I am very happy with my purchase and even bought two for my best friend who called to tell me that this thing is a miracle tool ha ha.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing tool .. Impressed ..üëç</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this though it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought. But makes if easier to use.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have had extremely cracked heels for many years and have tried every product out there on the market to get rid of them. I&#x27;ve used the pediegg which worked great but became dull after filing my feet one time. I&#x27;ve also tried all types of foot files, pumice stones and cracked heel creams. None of them really worked. This product was amazing. But along with this file I used the Prolinc callus eliminator gel too. Which I purchased from Amazon.  I soaked my feet in Epson salt for about 10 minutes covered the bottoms of my feet in the Callus eliminator for five minutes then wiped it off and then filed my feet with this micro plane colossal pedicure file.  I&#x27;ve had pedicures at nail salons. I love the way my feet look and feel afterwards but I cannot afford professional pedis, but this is pretty much what they do at the salons and it&#x27;s working really great for me.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and best of all you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet for it to work.  but you can do it that way as well.</li>
            <li> Great item!!! works great!</li>
            <li> Works really great they are smaller than the one I had previously which means it takes a little longer but the results are amazingly smooth. Also it doesn&#x27;t come with a plastic cover like my old one which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best pedicure file I have EVER had (and that includes the ones that have been used on me during professional pedicures). I liked it so well, I purchased another for my mom, who loves it every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li> This file works great to smooth rough heals and feet.</li>
            <li> My salon uses this rasp for my pedicure and it is fantastic.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Works awesome!  Bought based on reviews. Please heed warning about taking it slow as it is easy to scrape off too much in one sitting.</li>
            <li> These are the same type the use at some salons. They work incredibly well, and I have disgusting feet that crack and peel within days of getting a pedicure. I don&#x27;t like spending so much money, so these are a great deal because I don&#x27;t need pedicures every few weeks. No other at home product has done as good of a job with my heels, and I have tried them all on my gross feet. The ped egg, pumice, traditional files, and electric files are nothing compared to these microplane foot rasps. The two pack comes with two individually packaged files, which is perfect because I&#x27;m giving one away as a gift to my mom; she&#x27;s where I got my gross heels from in the first place!</li>
            <li> The rasp works really well - I am SO glad I bought this instead of the electric ones being shown on TV. I carefully read all the reviews and understood the positive reviews of the electric rollers were mainly fake reviews. I studied the reviews of this product and determined the positive reviews were sincere - the poor reviews seems to have resulted from customers not understanding the proper way to use the product. Both my husband and my feet - especially the heels - are really dry and cracked and this rasp took care of them in one major session and one follow up session the next day. All in all it took a total of about 12 minutes to get rid of the dead skin. Lots of dry skin  &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; falls on the floor so you actually have to sweep it up into a pile and get rid of it, unless you can figure out a way to do it over a wastebasket.  Don&#x27;t rasp your feet over a shag carpet! Sorry, I&#x27;m not going to post photos of my feet or dead skin. Although I appreciate the guy who did that. I am happy I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Why spend $40 for a pedicure at the salon when you can literally get better results with this at home?  Just used the Microplane rasp for the first time along with the ProLinc Callus Eliminator and the result was amazing - it sloughed off my calluses and smoothed dry cracked heels with ease.  I won&#x27;t be embarrassed to be barefoot anymore!</li>
            <li> Helps my dry heels. I soak my feet then use this tool while my feet are wet. It works well.</li>
            <li> On the plus side the foot rasp works as described - nice and sharp, really takes off the callouses well. I ordered a set of 2 pink rasps but received one pink and one brown; no pedicure nail file was included.</li>
            <li> Just love it&#x27;s what my feet needed!!!! When I read the other reviews I was thinking maybe they was just trying to push this product , not at all the this product will help anyone with rough feet plain and simple. The first time I seen this product was in the nail shop where I get my pedicures done. I love it and I knew I needed my own I looked on Amazon before didn&#x27;t see it. However looked a week later it was there as always my come to place came through thanks Amazon and the place that carried this product we love it !!!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, and I am impressed with how quick and easy it is to smooth the calluses on my heels.  Smooth in no time.</li>
            <li> The Pedicure rasps are the easiest and most efficient way to make your feet baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I spend 25 $ for my pedicures and an extra 5$ for them to exfoliate. This product is awesome and it has saved me so much money!! It came with two so my girlfriend and I only paid 5 dollars each! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and use it at least once a week and it&#x27;s just as sharp as it was the first day! Great investment!!! I will definitely order from this company again!</li>
            <li> This thing works miracles lol I&#x27;m ready for sandals lol... please be careful not to scrub too much off at once because your feet will feel like you got rug burns...</li>
            <li> Best foot rasp ever!!!  It gets all the dry skin in one treatment!!</li>
            <li> everyone should have one - guys too - easy to use (wet or dry) by by callous hello smooth feet</li>
            <li> Works almost too well.  Have to be careful when using.  The microplane will easily file away the dead skin, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will also cut into your skin.  The size is great, and the curvature makes it easy to use.  Definite beat the old &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; that does the similar thing.  I would suggest getting a small damp cloth underneath your feet when you do it and toss the towel into the washer.  It could have had a cover to catch the dead skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t make it any more effective than it already it (probably not as cost effective).</li>
            <li> The picture shows two pink microplane colossal pedicure&#x27;s and a bonus nail file. I received one pink and one brown micrplane colossal pedicure and did not receive the bonus file. The pedicure foot files looked a little scratched up but still came in their own packages like new. They work great. Just wish it would have been what was advertised.</li>
            <li> good if you don&#x27;t shave off toomuch.. i ended up bleeding. shaved off too much before I realized. hahaha</li>
            <li> heed everyone else&#x27;s warnings - Take it slow and make sure you check often that you aren&#x27;t scraping fresh skin. It does a really good job of getting rid of all the dead skin, but it&#x27;s easy to overdo it. I usually sit on a little stool in front of the toilet and use it over the toilet to minimize cleanup afterward.</li>
            <li> works great very good value it is huge with a rubber grip I see I see it lasting a very very long time does the job quickly safely a very good bye don&#x27;t hesitate buy the two pack instead of the single a lot better value</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! HELPS ME TO GET RID OF MY SANDPAPER FEET</li>
            <li> Bought this after it was used on my salon pedi. I have extremely dry heels and this is the best scraper I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the most effective way to remove hard dry skin from feet! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things but nothing works like this !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping greaaaaaaat product. I mean it really works. I use it on my own feet and my husbands. I have never seen his feet so clean without callus. Now I get complaints that his feey are not MANLY enough.....lol.</li>
            <li> Best Foot grater ever. Rasp, file, whatever, it looks like a cheese grater but it does any amazing job on feet. Use it on DRY skin. It says so right on the package but people still want to use it in the shower. A few revers have mentioned taking it slow and you should listen! Don&#x27;t try to remove every last bit of callus or dead skin from your feet at one time. If you need a lot of work do a little each day or every other day to give the underlying living skin time to adjust.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that works for my horribly calloused feet. It&#x27;s a must have for summer!</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the one I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply. The nasty just flies off, then just do a little fine tune smoothing with a pumice and  PAPOW! No more retched rough feet.</li>
            <li> I used to use the PedEgg - this rasp makes it SOOOOOO much easier to remove the yucky dry skin on my feet.. My feet get really dry, even with slathering on creams.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Heed others&#x27; warnings: this rasp works so well and you&#x27;re so fascinated by the dead skin coming off without any pressure or work, that it&#x27;s easy to go too thin.  You won&#x27;t feel it until the next day and feel a little tender.  You&#x27;ve been warned!  I was a little alarmed by the size--this is the same size as my kitchen rasp--not small and narrow like other foot files I&#x27;ve had.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt on any of the bumps along toes or heels.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Work great. This is the second set I purchased. These are for gifts.</li>
            <li> I just received this file today, this file is amazing, it took off all the dead skin on my feet. I used it on my feet while they were dry, which is what the instructions says.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased for my callouses and it works dry as well as wet.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE!! I have horrible feet :( and the summers kill my feet. Used this for first time tonight - so easy and gentle on feet. Was shocked at the immediate difference. Also bought a foot cream to use after this scrub. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product I used in my shop. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good quality pedicure tool and this is it. It works well. I have bought several for myself and makes a inexpensive gift for friends.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, do not dig to deeply, feet are soft afterwards. I own 2 of these foot graters!</li>
            <li> This file is very easy to use and quickly clears away any dry skin on the bottom of your feet.  I gave the 2nd one in the pack to my mom and she loved it as well!</li>
            <li> THE BEST I HAVE EVER USE.</li>
            <li> They are okay, not as good as the nail shop though.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!! I bought an amope and it didn&#x27;t work. This thing did the deed! I read previous reviews that said be careful not to take too much. I did it without soaking my feet and it was awesome. I wish I had taken before and after picture.</li>
            <li> My feet are definitely softer and smoother since using this. They look a million times better in sandals now!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for bad heals.</li>
            <li> Wow this this is fantastic.  Saves me from having to go get pedis as often as i used to due to being in an environment where i wear sandles all the time. The fact it cane with 2 i was able to gift the other.</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet feeling nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the most effective device I have purchased to deal with dry, cracked heels.  I highly recommend this item, but use care to not be too aggressive in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Perfect for keeping feet smooth in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I love these things!  Really help with my rough heels.  One for me and one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on tough calluses.  Just like the ones used in salons.  Be careful that you don&#x27;t remove too much skin.</li>
            <li> Your feet are never going to be happier! This product is the best thing you can do for your feet!!</li>
            <li> I just got this amazing file and it took care of the calouses that have been building up. It left my heels so smooth. I have been using pedegg but the blades have gotten so blunt out of the box that I would buy replacement blades and would have to throw them out right away. This just beats pedegg even when at its best because the microfilm are so smooth and it leaves your heels smooth rightaway, no need to sand them down afterwards. I am very happy with this purchase. I hope they last. Too bad I did not know about this product. Thanks to all others who have posted pictures and great reviews, now I own them.</li>
            <li> Best cheese grater foot file out there. Extremely sharp so when filing down skin remove a little at a time. Better results than the pedi egg; typically I will follow up by using a pumice stone after.</li>
            <li> Best solution I&#x27;ve found ever!</li>
            <li> I have bought many, many different tools for my calauses.  This is the best yet.  It does the job right..</li>
            <li> Love these I have bad calluses and it works great I know I have gotten. Pedis and they have used this and always wanted to have one I love this item so glad I found a place to get it</li>
            <li> My feed are horrible.  I have had this problem my whole life.  So did my dad.  So did his mom.  I have used a callus shaver for most of my life and I have had some terrible issues with cuts too deep.  This is much better.  You can still take too much off, but at least it doesn&#x27;t come out in huge chunks.  It does a great job.  Works way better than the pedi-egg thing.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t survive without this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!  Lightweight and effective. Easy to use and cheaper than going to get a pedicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing you can use on your feet.</li>
            <li> This rasp is amazing!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitators!  I will definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> This works great!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Did a great job on my feet.  They feel like brand new feet!  Soak your feet in apple cider vinegar for a half hour before you use these and you will have beautiful results.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! Definitely saves money because you can skip a pedicure but still have soft heels. You don&#x27;t have to have soften feet from the shower either you can use right on dry feet.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!  These files are amazing. They are sturdy and well made.  I think the blade was made in the USA but the whole thing was &amp;#34;assembled&amp;#34; in Mexico.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what you want them to do.  It says to use on dry feet and I was skeptical, but it really worked well.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give these more than 5 stars!!!  I like to keep my feet as soft as possible and this is the perfect tool!  I&#x27;ll be buying a few extras in the near future!</li>
            <li> Just got these, this file is awesome. I have dry skin on my heels and it comes right off (I am only going to do a little at a time each night so I don&#x27;t hurt my heels). Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best thing to use better then the stones for me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It scrapes your calloused feet like no other.  I got one for all my friends and they also love it!</li>
            <li> Just like my nail tech uses. Pumice stones and every thing else does an okay job, but this is the only thing that will really get all the rough/dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I take a bath.  It has improved the skin on my heels and significantly reduced my callous.  I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Be careful or you could injure yourself, that&#x27;s how powerful these things are.  In fact, I might have slighty overdone it once and had a sore big toe for almost a week!  The instructions tell you to use them on dry skin, and they work amazingly well.  Much better than using a stone or other kind of instrument.</li>
            <li> The only real way to remove callouses and dry skin. I discovered this at my nail salon. I bought so I can use in between visits. You would not believe how much dead akin it removes. Makes my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> Work really well but the metal seems to dull considerably after about 3 uses. I found them almost unusable after 5-6, even with proper care. So, buy several. Also, too big for nooks and crannies of your feet, but otherwise work really well.</li>
            <li> I have been using a popular rasp that has been seen on tv. However, over the years the quality of that particular product had declined, so I was looking for a replacement. I am so happy I found this foot rasp on amazon! They work great! The price was great, too. Very pleased. Recommend.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It is a dead skin slougher!  Looks like a cheese grater, very simple to use, and can make your feet sore if you do too much at one time.  It has a large surface area with a long sturdy handle so it is not too difficult to reach your feet if you aren&#x27;t very flexible. You get two in the package in case you need one in every bathroom, don&#x27;t want to share with your spouse or think you may lose it and can&#x27;t wait to buy another.  In all seriousness, it does a great job keeping the dry skin at bay between pedicures.  The instructions recommend using it on dry feet, although I personally have found that it is more effective right when I first get out of the shower.  I also tend to be too vigorous when I use it dry so try it both ways to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Like a ped egg with a handle.  Covers more surface area and save you time with endless pumicing!!!  Would def recommend :)</li>
            <li> Only need a professional pedi every once in a while!</li>
            <li> Good Quality... would purchase again.  I love being able to save money by giving myself my own pedicure!</li>
            <li> Love these .  I bought three of them previously only to have my daughters snag them and I even have a son-in-law that uses it.  Much better than other products I have purchased and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sloughing off dead skin from my heels</li>
            <li> Wow! Just wow!.... This foot file is amazing! Takes off calluses in no time and now my disgusting feet are gorgeous and baby soft again!.... Ordering two more for my Mom and sister!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Works so well!</li>
            <li> love these foot scrapers - have bought them for years - work great!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!!  In just a few minutes of use, it took off more of my calluses than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had.  Normally you would use something like this, followed by a pumice and then followed by some light sander to leave them soft. This microplaner takes off the calluses and leaves them soft, no other tools needed!  I was beyond shocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use this on wet or dry feet, but I use it while dry because (as gross as it is), I like to see the skin falling off LOL. I think you should be careful though as thing could very easily take off too much and leave your feet very tender.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with these. Use on clean dry feet to get the majority of dead stuff off your feet then you can do it again in the shower to get the excess of and smooth out. LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li> Save your money if you&#x27;re eyeing that amazing looking but ineffective Amop√© Pedi Perfect and buy this! This is an amazing tool and extremely effective. I have had horribly calloused feet for my entire life due to going barefoot all the time, even up and down our gravel driveway when I was a kid. My feet&#x27;s callouses had callouses and they were extremely tough. I saw the commercials for the Amope product and was very excited. Finally something that would give me the soft feet of my dreams... HA! Not a chance. That thing was no match for my iron-clad feet. I was frustrated, and scoped out Amazon for yet another solution and came across this beauty. I was dubious, but read the reviews and figured, what the heck, I&#x27;m not spending much $ if it doesn&#x27;t work. I eagerly awaited the delivery, and when I first took it out I was a bit disappointed. It just looked like a much larger version of the old Pedi-Egg (which kind of worked, but it was a lot of work for little effect). I tried it out anyway...and...WOW!! This thing is a serious power tool! Yeah, it&#x27;s not motorized, but this baby takes so little effort to shave off years of callouses. I was amazed as the tool quickly revealed baby-soft, pink feet! My mouth was agape and my heart leapt with joy. OK, that&#x27;s a little over the top but if you&#x27;ve lived with feet like mine you would understand. One of the reviewers told a hilarious cautionary tale about being a bit over-zealous with the scraping and I would back that up. I stopped before I damaged myself but could easily see that one could take it a bit too far and soft would turn to sore. So, be careful, but buy this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! I am returning my Amope and I&#x27;m stocking up on these puppies! (Though this thing is of such industrial strength I think if I bought just a couple more I&#x27;d probably be set up for baby-soft, pink feet for life!)  :)</li>
            <li> fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> Works well scrubbing dead skin off, not the best I have ever used, but is pretty nice. It is surprisingly bigger than I expected. Easy to hold, and use.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really works well.</li>
            <li> work&#x27;s great, just took a little too much skin off the first time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry rough skin on my feet. This file is amazing. It isn&#x27;t painful at all and doesn&#x27;t tickle you either. You barely have to apply any pressure for it to work its magic.  I spend a lot of money on foot products and this is by far my favorite purchase. It works better than any other lotions or files Combined, that I have used before.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Work amazingly well, and using too much can cause very sore feet!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> I recently got a pedicure, and they used a similar product on me.  I have had countless pedicure, but never had this used!  It looks like a big cheese grater.  The instructions say it is best to use on dry feet, but can do either way.  super effective, and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, like using the callous razors.  All is all works great.  I use this, then use a pumice stone to smooth out heels.  Great price, and a great gift too.</li>
            <li> My feet were in terrible condition with callouses, cracking and all sorts of dead skin build up. These rasps did an amazing job! My feet are super smooth again!</li>
            <li> This thing is crazy amazing. I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2 pack for when the other goes dull. Had cracked heels because I wear heels everyday and when not flip flops. Regular everyday foot files and ped egg did not faze it. It was getting painful. This thing got rid of all of it in literally 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my calluses. Great to use in between pedicures. You use it on dry feet. love the color as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool that I have found for getting this job done.  I have tried the ped egg and various other tools and this is way more effective - perhaps the handle gives you better leverage.  I had bought one and lost it on vacation.  I loved it so much - I bought this two-pack to replace it.  The only drawback is it can get a little messy and will require some clean up on your part when finished since there is nothing to catch the skin (like the ped egg).  Minor drawback but worth mentioning for those that would have a problem with it.  I have replaced it once and would do it again because it is so good at what it does.</li>
            <li> I have flip-flop feet, and my husband b has military boot feet. Neither of us are the soft foot kind. But this helps so much. Takes off the horrible cracked skin on our heels and toes. Easy to clean and make quick work of the tough hooves I have to call feet.</li>
            <li> These things work.  It is comfortable, not painful and shaves the dead skin right off.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I did have another type of microplane before I received this one, and there is no comparison.  This product did a fantastic job of filing down those nasty calluses I&#x27;ve developed over the years.  I don&#x27;t know if a person can ever totally eliminate calluses, but this new microplane will make it much easier to keep them under control.</li>
            <li> These foot files work great!</li>
            <li> This is a tool everyone should have at home either for DIY pedi&#x27;s or for those in between professional pedi appointments. Feet are left soft and smooth just be sure not to over scrape otherwise your feet will be tender for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for myself and loved it so much I bought 3 more for girlfriend, mum and Aunty....just be careful not to get to carried away because you don&#x27;t realize how much you are taking off as it shaves off such fine pieces...but really does work a treat. My mum has trouble work a lot because of hard places on her feat but she used this and she couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made</li>
            <li> Does what it says, used on my husband, had to be careful not to take too much off though, didn&#x27;t want him to be sore-footed!</li>
            <li> Nothing works for my scaly feet like these do!</li>
            <li> These are amazing can&#x27;t say enough keep ordering them cause I gave too many</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work as good as the foot rasps that are used when you get a professional pedicure.  It definitely is a good-sized rasp and sturdy enough. Here is the difference, the holes in the rasp are fairly small. Every where I go for a professional pedicure, the holes in the rasps are considerable bigger. The bigger holes do a better job.  Well, I looked &amp; looked and every rasp that I came across had this exact same design, with the smaller holes.  Maybe you can only find the nail &amp; spa rasps at wholesale suppliers.. ?  That being said they do work.  Maybe not 100% as good as the salons ones, however my feet have looked good throughout the summer!&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, so by and large I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> love it! will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  Buy this and you won&#x27;t need a professional again!  Everyone has said it already, but... don&#x27;t overdo it the first time!</li>
            <li> BEST dead skin/ callus remover EVER! I have tried every product/device under the sun that promises to remove the dreaded rough skin and calluses from the bottom of your feet and nothing works and quick or easy as this does. I even got my husband to start using it. I noticed that this is what the professionals were using when I went to go get a pedicure at the salon. So happy with this purchase and would buy again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Great!!! This microplaner is to refine the calluses so that you can add lotion and be sandal ready.</li>
            <li> I get laughed out of the pedicure place so I started doing my own. Work like a charm. Their loss.</li>
            <li> FINALLY a foot rasp that does what it says! I like it very much, but always follow with a &#x27;fine&#x27; file. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like these!  I just have to be sure to gently use them; once I filed too roughly and had a tiny area bleed.  Other than that, these work really well and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work! Use common sense and don&#x27;t over file. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!!! Just be careful with how long you spend in 1 area of your heel, it will be tinder  the next day if you aren&#x27;t careful! I will be a reoccurring customer :)</li>
            <li> better than I thought. long handle easy to use</li>
            <li> I have been picking my callused feet forever because I could never find the right tool to really get in there and do the job! This thing is amazing! My feet have never looked this good. No more picked raw feet and shredded sheets! 5 stars isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> Works great. Be careful not to take off too much skin!</li>
            <li> No need for pedicures now!!</li>
            <li> Saw this product at a local cosmetic wholesaler for twice the price and for only one rasp. Works great--even better with callus eliminator or sloughing lotion. Easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li> Wow, I read the reviews, but didn&#x27;t think this rasp would be able to handle my tough calluses - I was mistaken.  Like grating a hard parmesan cheese, I thought while it immediately worked on the dry foot - no soaking required!  Must be careful not to take off too much at a time!</li>
            <li> These files work very well.</li>
            <li> They really work!  Very sharp and easy to use, due to their over-sized shape.  They sure have helped my feet!</li>
            <li> This was used on me at a nail salon out of state. I had never seen it before. It completely removed my callouses without hurting. It is a very safe product that removes without fear of nicking sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are a very good product to use and have I love it..  I used it for all over my dry skin areas perfect tool....</li>
            <li> These perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> works good but just use it a bit each day when you get out of the shower or after soaking feet</li>
            <li> wonderful product and great price. you don&#x27;t need any other exfoliators.</li>
            <li> This file is fantastic. Maybe even too fantastic. I used it for less than 5 minutes on each foot and I&#x27;m in pain today! I&#x27;m not a foot file rookie either, so I knew not to do too much. Pedicure time will be cut in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind that this is essentially a cheese grater for your feet. You want to do less than you think you should because you&#x27;ll still have some rough skin to use a pumice or other smooth exfoliator on. Do yourself a favor and get a good foot lotion too!</li>
            <li> I love these and that&#x27;s why I ordered them...again.  I love my others.  If you want to have pretty feet and your feet are calloused and dry and ugly... This is the mother of all Rasps...  This is going to give you pretty feet... those little tiny things you buy in the drug store are pitiful...useless...  I can&#x27;t believe I ever thought they were working before I found these.  We&#x27;&#x27;ve all been doing our feet with these and our feet are looking great in our sandals... or just bare....  The difference will absolutely amaze you....  I wish I had seen these ten years ago!!!!  Awesome.</li>
            <li> These microplanes work really well.</li>
            <li> Best food tool I ever had</li>
            <li> they worked wonders on my feet. Definitely what was missing to keep my feet soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very good results. Well worth it. Curved handle would improve the tool for those with flexibility issues but overall, good purchase. Took a while to arrive.</li>
            <li> Mr. Pumice - too much work&lt;br /&gt;Heel shaver - blades rust &amp; dull quickly&lt;br /&gt;Microplane - THE.BEST.EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother got my dad one of these as a gift. And although I would love to put before &amp; after pics on here, the before might break the internet.  My mom &amp; dad had raved about it &amp; finally I tried theirs &amp; it has literally changed my feet for the better.  I will never go back to the heel shaver I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is awesome. It makes a night and day difference in your feet. It is SO QUICK to use!  You&#x27;re not filing or pumicing for a long time to get smooth feet or to get the rough thicker skin you want off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it wet or dry. I tend to use it dry because then I can see how much skin is falling off - sounds gross - but it feels like an accomplishment and you&#x27;d be surprised how much thick skin can easily file off.  What I like most about this product is that it files/removes skin in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s even possible not to like/love this at least you could use it for grating parmesan cheese (unlike a pumice stone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  You do not need to use this foot file often.  I used it about 10 days after the last time I used it and I regret it.  It is so effective at removing skin on your heels and any semi-thick skin that if you use it too often you can end up removing the layers of thicker skin that help protect your heel.  Using it so soon after the last time I used it has made my heels tender and hurt from my own weight.  I&#x27;d suggest going at least 3 weeks after the first time you use it before using it again.  Unless you have a condition that causes excessive skin turn over, most people should not need to use this on a weekly or biweekly basis.  Make sure your heels could use a good scraping before using this again. Remember your heels (and feet) bare all your body weight, they need thicker skin for protection.  You&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve used it too much/often.  Just be forewarned - this thing is EXTREMELY good at what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: A-Z NAIL SUPPLY&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 7 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.by: A-Z NAIL SUPPLY Shipped by: Amazon LLC Delivered: 7 days after order date Packaging:  Both files/rasps were inside plastic bags stapled at the top (see pic), these were delivered in a larger box containing other items.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. They work very well. Be careful though, if you get carried away you will have sore feet the next day.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price I&#x27;m happy. .</li>
            <li> heavy duty works great</li>
            <li> These babies don&#x27;t mess around! Easy does it though or you&#x27;ll be limping. They work great on tough calousses. Soft soles need not apply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this thing! It works so good!  Was suprised you use it on dry feet. You have to be so careful because you don&#x27;t even realize how much dry skin this thing is removing.  My feet have never looked so good and I get pedicures all the time. I wear sandals everyday so I have pretty thick calloused feet. NOT ANY MORE! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> all my dead skin on my heels seemed to disappear&lt;br /&gt;i do still use lotion to keep them soft&lt;br /&gt;this works much better than pediegg&lt;br /&gt;if you are going to buy anything dont waste your money on pediegg&lt;br /&gt;buy this instead..</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this foot file.  My feet have never been smoother or softer!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was hoping for!  I love getting pedicures because they always work magic on my feet - especially my horrid heels!  I always tried to use some other device for the in between times but nothing worked quite right.  Then the bright idea hit me to get the same tool - and wow!  I do use mine on dry feet like it suggests and this thing is a magic wand!  I heeded the advice before me to only do a little at a time so as to not wake up with sore feet.  I 1,000 times recommend this tool, especially in conjunction with the professional grade callus remover (you will need a cheaper board type file for that) and the nuskin epoch heel cream.  In less than a week I have new feet!  My heels went from deep cavernous cracks that looked as though they had a fight with a wood chipper (and lost) to incredibly smooth and my cracked heels are already healing!  This is way worth the money and way better than the pedegg, amope sander type things...I assure you this is what you want!</li>
            <li> It works wonderful and made my feet so soft. This is just as good as an electric one if not better</li>
            <li> these pedicure foot rasps are the same ones that pedicurists use, so they are wonderful</li>
            <li> best, most affordable pedi.  I was looking for a rotary tool but stumbled upon this rasp.  Its great, you have to be careful and my need a finishing buffer but this is great for thick callused heels.  You can really take skin off fast so be very careful.</li>
            <li> Great product...same product used during pedicures at salons.  I can do it myself and save money by not going to salon for pedicure.  Great product,  works well.</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber always leave my feet super soft!</li>
            <li> Works great and quick.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful!!! Great for calluses.</li>
            <li> Gets the dry calluses off with ease. Great for sloughing off just the right amount of dry heels. Easy to clean and sanitize too.</li>
            <li> when you have calluses like I do, nothing else comes close because they are all so small they take forever to use (ped egg as example) the microplane rasp makes quick work of my callus removal and leaves my feet feeling like new in just minutes.  I&#x27;ve already worn out two of these over the years and have ordered two more and couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have tried everything on market this is the best so far</li>
            <li> Do a really good job.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as needed to rasp off those stubborn foot calluses.</li>
            <li> Painful, and tears up your skin. Leaves skin hanging and not removed. Needs to be repeated very often. Skin still stays rough. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very effective tool for removing rough dry skin. It&#x27;s overall large size makes it easy to handle. Need to be careful it&#x27;s easy to file into sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This really gets all the dead skin off your feet and leaves it silky smooth, A+.</li>
            <li> The product arrived today.  I immediately began to use it since instruction said it was best to use on dry feet. I was just going to test it for a few seconds. Once I saw the results I couldn&#x27;t put it down. I finished both feet in one hour. Outstanding results and so inexpensive. I bought one for my mom too.</li>
            <li> This foot rasp is the bomb! It really takes off the rough, dry skin and leaves your heels feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> Works great just don&#x27;t get carried away scraping like i did my feet hurt now</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping dead skin off of heels. Great seller too!!</li>
            <li> I love this!  The foot rasp makes your feet smooth and soft.  I gave a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer of these. They work awesome!</li>
            <li> This thing works!  I have tried many different types of products for smoothing my heels with very limited success.  This product is really helpful.  I was afraid of it at first, but after using it carefully a few times I am more comfortable with it.  I put a thick cream on my heels afterwards and wear footies for a few hours. My heels look perfect!</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops all year around and my feet suffer because of it. I get calluses on my big toe as well as my heel. I get a pedicure and it comes back with days so I decided to buy this tool myself and use it often as I can. First, make sure to read the directions. I think I went a little over board the first time using it and my feet were really sore the next day. Don&#x27;t go crazy and you should be fine. It works amazingly well. I use it once a week or so and make sure to lotion up after using it. I do not know how I went so long without owning one of my own. So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic, they are just like the pros. My feet r in much better shape now!</li>
            <li> I have been using revlon pumice stone once or twice a week for more than a year, and I really like it for how smooth it was making my foot feel but I still had that - not so good-  looking. Now, I am using this product once a week for almost one month and it really does a magic, like instantly satisfying result. it removes the dead skin and reveals a happy foot. The only downside with this foot rasp is when the dead skin start to come again, I found it like needles but I would get rid of them instantly with my Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it did wonders on my feet. It worked much better than just a pumice. Will be something I use regularly.</li>
            <li> These did NOT work at all! I&#x27;ve bought a couple of them because they seemed like they were different models, but all of foot rasps that I&#x27;ve bought in this style are terrible! I ended up having to buy another one that has bigger scrapers and is easier to use. This one just scratched my feet and didn&#x27;t scrape off any dead skin at all. Absolutely terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> works great gets all that dry skin I like to use it dry!</li>
            <li> These beat out the PedEgg any day. They don&#x27;t have the dust capturing &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; but they do a way better job. Just don&#x27;t be silly and over use them, you do need a heel :-)</li>
            <li> Great product.I wear sandals a lot and this product works very well on my feet.</li>
            <li> By far the best dry use foot file. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Lose ten years off your feet in 5 minutes! A gentle and quick way to remove calluses and dead skin carefully.</li>
            <li> I was awesome!!! It&#x27;s really worked!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. Best foot rasp ever. Ped - egg what?? Just be careful not to remove to much skin.</li>
            <li> love it. just like the ones at the salon. BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> As advertised. Works well. Would purchase again.</li>
