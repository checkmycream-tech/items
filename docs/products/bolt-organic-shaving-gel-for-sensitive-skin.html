    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice product. I&#x27;m a red head and going on 69 in a few weeks, so after years of body surfing, hiking, snow boarding and burning the crap out of my skin, it&#x27;s pretty sensitive. I usually use a foam product from the drug store, but I wanted to try this gel. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. In fact it&#x27;s got great moisturizing properties. And it gets the job done for a nice close shave. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have light dry skin and had stopped using a wet razor years ago. Thought I&#x27;d give this a shot and it works great!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving, not sure if that&#x27;s common or not.  My wife had me try this product and says I haven&#x27;t moaned about shaving since.  I get a better shave, faster, without the irritation.  It surprised me when I first tried it.  One pass with the razor did the trick in all but a couple spots, no (zero) irritation even going against the grain.  More importantly, I am done in half the time.  I still don&#x27;t love to shave but using this stuff makes shaving much better.</li>
            <li> Bolt performs as advertised. It&#x27;s a good product that deserves a try. In particular, I noticed that my face is smoother and the razor moves on it easier than with the store-bought gel I have been using. In addition, the skin on my face is more moist and soft after the shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this product for his sensitive skin. I am so happy he is using an organic product. It smells fresh and wonderful!</li>
            <li> Really like the way it goes on my face. Very nice scent that is very light. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Simple and effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not every shaving product lives up to it&#x27;s hype, but this one truly makes the grade.  The convenient pump makes it fast and easy to get a close shave even in the shower and the coconut and other oils leaves the skin soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Simple - I&#x27;m sold on the organics, ease, AND price! Go get some and see!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the best shaving gel or foam and have tried so many brands. I have very sensitive skin but the only method that gives me a close enough shave is with a regular razor. No electric shaver can handle my tough beard. So when I purchased Bolt Superskin Shaving Gel I thought maybe this one will work. I&#x27;m so happy I tried it. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy the razor took the hair off my face and neck and the product really did what it says it would do: I didn&#x27;t get one cut or any razor bur and when I was done my face felt the smoothest and cleanest I&#x27;ve ever had it feel after shaving. You gotta try this product. You&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth and soft. I dig that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product, as I will be returning it, so I won&#x27;t comment on the shave gel, but I have two complaints that led me to return it: #1) despite the picture showing 3 bottles, only ONE tiny 4 oz bottle is what you get. I see now that nowhere in the description does it say three are included, but the picture was somewhat misleading, especially at this price; and #2)The one tiny 4 oz bottle that I received had leaked about 1/6 of its contents in the shipping box. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t worry about a small leak, but at this price that&#x27;s about $4 worth of product that I paid for and did not receive. Back it goes.</li>
            <li> Works well! I like that I can understand the ingredients. No heavy perfumes or dyes! Great for sensitive skin. I use it on my legs and my man loves it as well. But I have totally stolen it from him :)</li>
            <li> really really great products!</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use, store and travel. Smooth shave that also allows you to more easily see any spots the razor may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;The razor fairly glides across your face and leaves your skin soft and moisturized. Even though originally intended for men&#x27;s use, women will very likely love it for shaving their legs, too.</li>
            <li> Like gels but find them hard to clean from the razor. Not so with Bolt, great shave, easy to use, good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a very light beard and normally use a three-head electric or soap and a razor now and then. But now I am totally spoiled with this this Bolt product. Using this product gives me the closest shave I have ever had. One shave lasts me almost a full two days before feeling any stubble. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Provides a great, close shave and leaves my skin feeling nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> This gel is great.  I gave it as gift and the recipient loved it.  The shave is close and the fragrance is very masculine and appealing.  The user of the product told me that he liked it because he can see the whiskers come off due to the lack of heavy foam which obscures the shaving area. This was a big plus in his opinion even though he needed to get used to not having all that foam.Skin is moist and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed shaving so much. My razor glided over my face and my skin was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine shaving without this product.</li>
            <li> Good day to all at Bolt! For decades I have been trying to find a shave lotion product that would do it all and thanks to the reviews on Amazon and buying my first two containers of the Bolt product—I am sold!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best stuff on the market—Genius!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does everything and more. Super course beard here and it shaves it off like butter with smooth as a babies skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You got me for life and I will be spreading the word too to my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best to you and your success———&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely—M. Brooks</li>
            <li> Best Shaving Gel I have every used, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like it!  The gel lathers right up and has a nice clean fragrance.  It left my face feeling smooth and soft after my shave.  I also like the fact that the bottle is small and you don&#x27;t need to use more than a few drops per shave.</li>
            <li> I flew into Buffalo and was staying at a friends house and needed some shave cream since I didn&#x27;t pack any. I was skeptical when he lent me his Bolt but I liked it so much I ordered my own! ...who&#x27;d a thunk an organic shave gel could do a better job than my favorite shave creme but it sure as heck does. Good stuff</li>
