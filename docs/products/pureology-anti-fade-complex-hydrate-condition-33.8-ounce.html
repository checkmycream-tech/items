            <li>Great story.</li>
            <li>I also use the Hydrate shampoo and the two together do a great job for me.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use these products and happily pay a premium for doing so.  </li>
            <li>But Pureology has great hair care</li>
            <li>As of now, this is my favorite conditioner on the market!!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, the difference in my hair is amazing!  </li>
            <li>and I asked for the hair stylist recommendation on which product would make sure I maintained the color the best.</li>
            <li>Love the tingling effect and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved pureology products and this conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is as good as a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it and loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look good and feel good</li>
            <li>Animals shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer and die so we can look good.</li>
            <li>The  conditioner has a pleasant smell and is very rich, leaving the hair in great condition after application.  </li>
            <li>My hubby even commented on how nice my hair looks (this was after a fantastic haircut, lol!).  </li>
            <li>It was a very convincing imposter in terms of how it looked and smelled, but it had zero moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the color</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and smells great.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use anything else, and believe me I have tried many others!</li>
            <li>set of shampoo and conditioner was first introduced to me by my best friend.</li>
            <li>I love this line!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features of this conditioner is the minty tingle!  </li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing!  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li>When I first began to use Pureology products about a year ago, I was impressed with their efficacy.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, and the vendor got it to us quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>However, this conditioner that I bought on Amazon works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely amazing when it starts tingly.  </li>
            <li>Amazing price........</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair smooth, moisturized, and feeling great.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing</li>
            <li>My baby-fine hair loves this stuff and the minty tingle and smell are amazing.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends have tried it and have not been so thrilled about the mint smell, but I don&#x27;t think they were expecting it.  </li>
            <li>Love how good it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to be on the receiving end of a compliment.  </li>
            <li>The price is way better than the salon and the delivery has been consistently good.</li>
            <li>, this is a great product that keeps my hair in super shape.</li>
            <li>Also, extremely strong scent and that isn&#x27;t a good thing in this case.  </li>
            <li>The Pureology conditioners work well, but this one has a very strong fragrance of mint which is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!</li>
            <li>: if you are purchasing based on this review, assure that you&#x27;re purchasing the Hydrate Conditioner and not the Hydrate LIGHT Conditioner, which is good but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly feeling on my scalp when I leave in for 10 minutes (kind of a minty feeling).  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Although I have easily tangled hair (and a lot of it!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a very light conditioner</li>
            <li>The minty smell is very refreshing, leaves a great tingle on your head and leaves your hair so soft...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and when you can get it on sale on amazon for this large bottle it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li>I love the way this brand makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it (my hairstylist uses it and gives me a travel size of it each year at Christmas).</li>
            <li>So I tried it and love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it is more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was all most 2 inches below the top.</li>
            <li>all I love the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for colored hair including Joico, Matrix, &amp; Redken.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll want to try it yourself anyway, then you will say \\&quot;Hey, that review</li>
            <li>I love the savings over buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li>sure if I will buy it via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will never use anything else again</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I had not dyed my hair since I was in college which is more years ago</li>
            <li>The products cost more the the coloring</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This has evolved into my favorite hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Pureology Anti-Fade Conditioner seems to keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love the results.  </li>
            <li>Favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>Many people assume the quality of a product based how it feels in their hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!wait 5 minutes for it to wear off.</li>
            <li>Refreshing without being overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>I love the way this tingles on your head.</li>
            <li>The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product........</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products for my hair and this is the best!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, how it feels while it&#x27;s on my head and how it leaves my hair feeling.  </li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>I can truthfully say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>It has a great mint smell and works like a charm, which is saying something because I have very fine soft hair</li>
            <li>I have used this brand before but not this exact shampoo and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and have used pureology for a long time.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>so I thought I could live with the smell if it gave great results.</li>
            <li>There is a strong scent, but I love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my chemically treated hair look soft and healthy - and it makes a great smelling stand in for shave gel in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell (a pleasant peppermint), and it leaves my hair soft and without frizz.</li>
            <li>LOVE the product -- great smell and works terrific</li>
            <li>I leave it on longer than a normal person because it feels sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>Makes my gray hair smooth and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also sulfate free</li>
            <li>This product really does work; whether you&#x27;re buying it to control your fizzy hair, or want to use a conditioner that&#x27;s kind to your colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I felt like my hair did not absorb it well, so my hair is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I have discovered that WHERE I buy the product is important.  </li>
            <li>This one leaves hair relatively light and still smooth.</li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product as I have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>For those who have sensitive skin or scalp, this may not be the conditioner for you because it will tingle your scalp for a good 5 minutes after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, makes my hair soft, can&#x27;t say if it helps retain color.  </li>
            <li>It has a fantastic peppermint scent, is a rich conditioner that detangles and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very nourished and very easy to style.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is supposed to be absorbed into the scalp and hair not sit on top of it and wash straight out like most do.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is interested, you can get more info at [...] or</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that looks dirty with too much product - this is light and perfect - and smells great!</li>
            <li>This product is totally worth the price and lasts because just a little is needed to achieve great results!</li>
            <li>And it still looked shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li>If my hair is tangled, johnson no more tangles , what I use on my toddler works better then anything else, for conditioning and shine I find pantene&#x27;s mask and 3 minute miracle justas good as brands that cost 5x or more.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally full of tangles and this conditioner has helped with that significantly.  </li>
            <li>so my hair needs special attention.</li>
            <li>, my hair is so soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very curly; so it dries out and frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>It make my scalp feel all tingly, has a nice Rosemary smell, and jeeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>love it, it is the real product</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to make sure my look was maintained.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the minty smell, but still love the product.</li>
            <li>Has lasted over a year and still about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel so soft, and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner for my dry curly hair I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and most have not worked and if they did it was the conditioner that came with hair dying stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered from this place of business several times and the results are always the same, EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell people speak of is mild though noticeable while in the shower and maybe 5 minutes after.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it. :)</li>
            <li>This conditioner handles my tangles great and doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bonus is that this makes my hair extremely soft (yet not heavy or oily), smells mild/nice and has a good ingredient list.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money I bought it for.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>or so then it is very likely that your body&#x27;s own oil is replenishing the hair</li>
            <li>It is literally worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth money.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair conditioner I have ever used for my thin, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny and soft and really healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Received the product super fast in the mail!  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers had a good point about issues with non-salon buys.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t listen to was right.</li>
            <li>(if they haven&#x27;t already) cause if I ever notice a difference I will quit it right away.</li>
            <li>However, as I am now approaching our anniversary, I am somewhat less impressed.  </li>
            <li>I have always have had to use a very good conditioner especially as I have aged and continue to color my hair.  </li>
            <li>first time I went to use it</li>
            <li>I will buy one more time and if it is the same way I will just go to the store and buy it.</li>
            <li>Much better that what I dragged home from my last haircut.</li>
            <li>Love Pureology, It is definitely a Hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li>I actually adore this product when it&#x27;s authentic, which this was not.</li>
            <li>like when I have my hair up in a ponytail... now that it is softer and smoother, my holder doesn&#x27;t always stay in very well!</li>
            <li>love this product...sells for double the price in the salon I go to.</li>
            <li>My hair finally looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>Really helps hold the color, so does the Pureology shampoo!</li>
            <li>This helps to keep my color consistent and my hair moisturized</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many conditioners but I come back to this one.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Pureology products and this conditioner did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>product is pricey, but works very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for my unruly hair and this stuff works consistently.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the only conditioner I will use, this order was a reorder of a product I&#x27;ve used many times.  </li>
            <li>stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I know that Pureology is a favorite of the makeupalley hair forum and I&#x27;ve seen it recommended numerous times.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day, so conditioners that don&#x27;t work and leave my hair dry are very easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft for most of the day and I live in a very dry climate (Colorado, where the dew point is often -0) and work outside, which says a great deal on behalf of the product effectiveness.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair smooth and less kinky, more manageable.  </li>
            <li>have tried many products that were supposed to act as a conditioner, but this one feels and works for my &amp;#34;old Man&#x27;s&amp;#34; grey hair.</li>
            <li>Pureology is by far superior to these other products.</li>
            <li>kind of a let down (considering the amount I paid)</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t lose color as quickly as before.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my dry, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this about 2 years ago it is awesome for dry, thick, frizzy, colored hair.  </li>
            <li>, b/c I&#x27;m finally beginning to understand why some people complain about having fine hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this large bottle since it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>if you can afford to spend a little more, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, REALLY like it.</li>
            <li>Who really cares though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Another bonus of using Pureology is you do not have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is also much healthier as well.</li>
            <li>and I was very concerned about fading, and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to brush my wet hair before putting in a leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>I looked for years for a product that really conditioned my hair, instead of just feeling like it made it oily, and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>Well, it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li>slippery conditioner suggests it is hydrating your hair (the whole point).</li>
            <li>Really helped with avoiding the brassy color when you highlight your hair lighter.</li>
            <li>It has really helped keep my hair from drying out this winter too.</li>
            <li>Pureology is devoted to color treated hair and this conditioner really does its job well.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong peppermint smell and when you put it on you get a cool rush similar to the feeling of using icy hot.  </li>
            <li>The story engages and keeps you enraptured from beginning to dramatic and happy ending.</li>
            <li>I particularily like that it doesn&#x27;t take me forever to rinse enough of it out of my hair to reach a  point where it feels clean, not gooey.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like paying the high price for this stuff, but</li>
            <li>Leaves my dry, curly hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated so it gets dry.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it cost significantly less than buying it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I also implored them to please sell this conditioner on their own website so that we consumers can enjoy the convenience of online ordering without having to worry about receiving a fake.</li>
            <li>So needless to say I love Pureology&#x27;s products and I love the fact that they are vegan.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and will wake you up with that minty smell and tingle your scalp just a little.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, along with the hydrate shampoo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for both males and females, as the scent is neutral.</li>
            <li>There are trial size bottles at Beauty Warehouse type stores, where all of the other professional hair products are sold and trust me, you will love this line of hair care products.  </li>
            <li>If you live in New Orleans, you probably won&#x27;t have as big a moisture problem and your review should share the fact that you live in a veritable sauna, but if you live in Arizona or Colorado that is important to consider when making a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner has been rated very high, because it makes one&#x27;s head tingle leaving one with a completely refreshed and revitalized feeling.</li>
            <li>I tried this once and was hooked, now everytime I use a different conditioner I dont like it because it doesnt give me the same soft and smooth hair as this does!</li>
            <li>Hair is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and I don&#x27;t have to use a detangler or leave-in conditioner anymore!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally pretty frizzy but since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff (over the last three months)</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is exactly the same as what I buy at the salon.  </li>
            <li>This keeps it moisturized and free from damage without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Waxy conditioners can feel great while in the shower, but your hair is as stripped as usual once your hair is dried out.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and silky without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair smooth and silky and my favorite part is how it makes your head tingly and cold when you are washing your hair.  </li>
            <li>Of course I have allergies and I stand in the shower breathing it in to clear my nose.  </li>
            <li>No dandruff with Pureology, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but so far I have not detected a difference.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The product is as ordered and came extremely fast (on regular service) -- 2 days.</li>
            <li>did not like the smell of the shammpoo or contioner, but I am sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>The conditioner, left my hair very tangly, and the color started to fade within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>wow, ordered yesterday got it today...</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft silky texture to your hair, and makes it tangle-free.</li>
            <li>Keeps my color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Have used it before, makes my hair so soft and managable,  also gives it volume as well as holds my color</li>
            <li>I use both the shampoo and conditioner and it completely cleans and conditions my hair.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and manageable for a few days after shampooing, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It definitely hydrates well, giving my parched strands much needed moisture.  </li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve wasted countless dollars on, so it&#x27;s nice to find a brand that actually delivers on its promises.  </li>
            <li>Now maybe I got one that just happened to be less full</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why it is cheaper; they give out half full bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Just use a small amount (a nickle&#x27;s worth), rub your hands together to get it smooth, and then apply on very wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair regularly and use a high volume of peroxide, but you&#x27;d never know it after using these products.  </li>
            <li>I always end up coming back to Pureology, even though it isn&#x27;t sold where I live, and I have to order it online.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will go back  to the Pureology Nanoworks which works just as well and has a much nicer smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine but very thick hair and as a added bonus a very sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>The only downside would be the smell and feel -- it&#x27;s like like Icy Hot.  </li>
            <li>It is expensive, but purchasing the bigger bottles is, in the long run, more economical than purchasing the 8 ounce size.  </li>
            <li>I not only color my hair but live in Sunny South Florida where I am out in the sun any time I go outside.</li>
            <li>Long live animals...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is hard to find a conditioner that will actually detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>If your scalp can endure 5 minutes of the tinkling sensitive (which really isn&#x27;t so bad), then you&#x27;ll probably love the conditioner as much as I do!</li>
            <li>: very fast I got it in a few days&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found that provides the right amount of hydration without making my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where the weather is very dry</li>
            <li>Good product and less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is super concentrated and very small amounts of both products do miracles on my hair.  </li>

            <li> Great story.</li>
            <li> I also use the Hydrate shampoo and the two together do a great job for me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use these products and happily pay a premium for doing so.  </li>
            <li> But Pureology has great hair care</li>
            <li> As of now, this is my favorite conditioner on the market!!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, the difference in my hair is amazing!  </li>
            <li> and I asked for the hair stylist recommendation on which product would make sure I maintained the color the best.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling effect and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved pureology products and this conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is as good as a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it and loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look good and feel good</li>
            <li> Animals shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer and die so we can look good.</li>
            <li> The  conditioner has a pleasant smell and is very rich, leaving the hair in great condition after application.  </li>
            <li> My hubby even commented on how nice my hair looks (this was after a fantastic haircut, lol!).  </li>
            <li> It was a very convincing imposter in terms of how it looked and smelled, but it had zero moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the color</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything else, and believe me I have tried many others!</li>
            <li> set of shampoo and conditioner was first introduced to me by my best friend.</li>
            <li> I love this line!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features of this conditioner is the minty tingle!  </li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing!  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> When I first began to use Pureology products about a year ago, I was impressed with their efficacy.  </li>
            <li> The product is great, and the vendor got it to us quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> However, this conditioner that I bought on Amazon works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It feels absolutely amazing when it starts tingly.  </li>
            <li> Amazing price........</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair smooth, moisturized, and feeling great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing</li>
            <li> My baby-fine hair loves this stuff and the minty tingle and smell are amazing.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends have tried it and have not been so thrilled about the mint smell, but I don&#x27;t think they were expecting it.  </li>
            <li> Love how good it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to be on the receiving end of a compliment.  </li>
            <li> The price is way better than the salon and the delivery has been consistently good.</li>
            <li> , this is a great product that keeps my hair in super shape.</li>
            <li> Also, extremely strong scent and that isn&#x27;t a good thing in this case.  </li>
            <li> The Pureology conditioners work well, but this one has a very strong fragrance of mint which is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!</li>
            <li> : if you are purchasing based on this review, assure that you&#x27;re purchasing the Hydrate Conditioner and not the Hydrate LIGHT Conditioner, which is good but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly feeling on my scalp when I leave in for 10 minutes (kind of a minty feeling).  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Although I have easily tangled hair (and a lot of it!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a very light conditioner</li>
            <li> The minty smell is very refreshing, leaves a great tingle on your head and leaves your hair so soft...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and when you can get it on sale on amazon for this large bottle it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I love the way this brand makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it (my hairstylist uses it and gives me a travel size of it each year at Christmas).</li>
            <li> So I tried it and love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it is more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was all most 2 inches below the top.</li>
            <li> all I love the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for colored hair including Joico, Matrix, &amp; Redken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll want to try it yourself anyway, then you will say \\&quot;Hey, that review</li>
            <li> I love the savings over buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li> sure if I will buy it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will never use anything else again</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I had not dyed my hair since I was in college which is more years ago</li>
            <li> The products cost more the the coloring</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This has evolved into my favorite hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Pureology Anti-Fade Conditioner seems to keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love the results.  </li>
            <li> Favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> Many people assume the quality of a product based how it feels in their hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!wait 5 minutes for it to wear off.</li>
            <li> Refreshing without being overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> I love the way this tingles on your head.</li>
            <li> The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product........</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products for my hair and this is the best!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, how it feels while it&#x27;s on my head and how it leaves my hair feeling.  </li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> I can truthfully say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> It has a great mint smell and works like a charm, which is saying something because I have very fine soft hair</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before but not this exact shampoo and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and have used pureology for a long time.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> so I thought I could live with the smell if it gave great results.</li>
            <li> There is a strong scent, but I love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my chemically treated hair look soft and healthy - and it makes a great smelling stand in for shave gel in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell (a pleasant peppermint), and it leaves my hair soft and without frizz.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product -- great smell and works terrific</li>
            <li> I leave it on longer than a normal person because it feels sooooo good.  </li>
            <li> Makes my gray hair smooth and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also sulfate free</li>
            <li> This product really does work; whether you&#x27;re buying it to control your fizzy hair, or want to use a conditioner that&#x27;s kind to your colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I felt like my hair did not absorb it well, so my hair is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that WHERE I buy the product is important.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves hair relatively light and still smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product as I have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li> For those who have sensitive skin or scalp, this may not be the conditioner for you because it will tingle your scalp for a good 5 minutes after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, makes my hair soft, can&#x27;t say if it helps retain color.  </li>
            <li> It has a fantastic peppermint scent, is a rich conditioner that detangles and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very nourished and very easy to style.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is supposed to be absorbed into the scalp and hair not sit on top of it and wash straight out like most do.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is interested, you can get more info at [...] or</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that looks dirty with too much product - this is light and perfect - and smells great!</li>
            <li> This product is totally worth the price and lasts because just a little is needed to achieve great results!</li>
            <li> And it still looked shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li> If my hair is tangled, johnson no more tangles , what I use on my toddler works better then anything else, for conditioning and shine I find pantene&#x27;s mask and 3 minute miracle justas good as brands that cost 5x or more.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally full of tangles and this conditioner has helped with that significantly.  </li>
            <li> so my hair needs special attention.</li>
            <li> , my hair is so soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and very curly; so it dries out and frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li> It make my scalp feel all tingly, has a nice Rosemary smell, and jeeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> love it, it is the real product</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to make sure my look was maintained.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the minty smell, but still love the product.</li>
            <li> Has lasted over a year and still about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel so soft, and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner for my dry curly hair I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and most have not worked and if they did it was the conditioner that came with hair dying stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered from this place of business several times and the results are always the same, EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell people speak of is mild though noticeable while in the shower and maybe 5 minutes after.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner handles my tangles great and doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bonus is that this makes my hair extremely soft (yet not heavy or oily), smells mild/nice and has a good ingredient list.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> or so then it is very likely that your body&#x27;s own oil is replenishing the hair</li>
            <li> It is literally worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth money.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner I have ever used for my thin, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and soft and really healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Received the product super fast in the mail!  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers had a good point about issues with non-salon buys.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t listen to was right.</li>
            <li> (if they haven&#x27;t already) cause if I ever notice a difference I will quit it right away.</li>
            <li> However, as I am now approaching our anniversary, I am somewhat less impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have always have had to use a very good conditioner especially as I have aged and continue to color my hair.  </li>
            <li> first time I went to use it</li>
            <li> I will buy one more time and if it is the same way I will just go to the store and buy it.</li>
            <li> Much better that what I dragged home from my last haircut.</li>
            <li> Love Pureology, It is definitely a Hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li> I actually adore this product when it&#x27;s authentic, which this was not.</li>
            <li> like when I have my hair up in a ponytail... now that it is softer and smoother, my holder doesn&#x27;t always stay in very well!</li>
            <li> love this product...sells for double the price in the salon I go to.</li>
            <li> My hair finally looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> Really helps hold the color, so does the Pureology shampoo!</li>
            <li> This helps to keep my color consistent and my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many conditioners but I come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Pureology products and this conditioner did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> product is pricey, but works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for my unruly hair and this stuff works consistently.  </li>
            <li> Since this is the only conditioner I will use, this order was a reorder of a product I&#x27;ve used many times.  </li>
            <li> stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I know that Pureology is a favorite of the makeupalley hair forum and I&#x27;ve seen it recommended numerous times.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day, so conditioners that don&#x27;t work and leave my hair dry are very easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft for most of the day and I live in a very dry climate (Colorado, where the dew point is often -0) and work outside, which says a great deal on behalf of the product effectiveness.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair smooth and less kinky, more manageable.  </li>
            <li> have tried many products that were supposed to act as a conditioner, but this one feels and works for my &amp;#34;old Man&#x27;s&amp;#34; grey hair.</li>
            <li> Pureology is by far superior to these other products.</li>
            <li> kind of a let down (considering the amount I paid)</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t lose color as quickly as before.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my dry, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this about 2 years ago it is awesome for dry, thick, frizzy, colored hair.  </li>
            <li> , b/c I&#x27;m finally beginning to understand why some people complain about having fine hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this large bottle since it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> if you can afford to spend a little more, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, REALLY like it.</li>
            <li> Who really cares though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Another bonus of using Pureology is you do not have to use much at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is also much healthier as well.</li>
            <li> and I was very concerned about fading, and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to brush my wet hair before putting in a leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> I looked for years for a product that really conditioned my hair, instead of just feeling like it made it oily, and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> Well, it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li> slippery conditioner suggests it is hydrating your hair (the whole point).</li>
            <li> Really helped with avoiding the brassy color when you highlight your hair lighter.</li>
            <li> It has really helped keep my hair from drying out this winter too.</li>
            <li> Pureology is devoted to color treated hair and this conditioner really does its job well.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong peppermint smell and when you put it on you get a cool rush similar to the feeling of using icy hot.  </li>
            <li> The story engages and keeps you enraptured from beginning to dramatic and happy ending.</li>
            <li> I particularily like that it doesn&#x27;t take me forever to rinse enough of it out of my hair to reach a  point where it feels clean, not gooey.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like paying the high price for this stuff, but</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry, curly hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated so it gets dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it cost significantly less than buying it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I also implored them to please sell this conditioner on their own website so that we consumers can enjoy the convenience of online ordering without having to worry about receiving a fake.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I love Pureology&#x27;s products and I love the fact that they are vegan.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight and will wake you up with that minty smell and tingle your scalp just a little.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, along with the hydrate shampoo.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for both males and females, as the scent is neutral.</li>
            <li> There are trial size bottles at Beauty Warehouse type stores, where all of the other professional hair products are sold and trust me, you will love this line of hair care products.  </li>
            <li> If you live in New Orleans, you probably won&#x27;t have as big a moisture problem and your review should share the fact that you live in a veritable sauna, but if you live in Arizona or Colorado that is important to consider when making a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been rated very high, because it makes one&#x27;s head tingle leaving one with a completely refreshed and revitalized feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried this once and was hooked, now everytime I use a different conditioner I dont like it because it doesnt give me the same soft and smooth hair as this does!</li>
            <li> Hair is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable and I don&#x27;t have to use a detangler or leave-in conditioner anymore!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty frizzy but since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff (over the last three months)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is exactly the same as what I buy at the salon.  </li>
            <li> This keeps it moisturized and free from damage without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Waxy conditioners can feel great while in the shower, but your hair is as stripped as usual once your hair is dried out.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and silky without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It makes hair smooth and silky and my favorite part is how it makes your head tingly and cold when you are washing your hair.  </li>
            <li> Of course I have allergies and I stand in the shower breathing it in to clear my nose.  </li>
            <li> No dandruff with Pureology, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but so far I have not detected a difference.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The product is as ordered and came extremely fast (on regular service) -- 2 days.</li>
            <li> did not like the smell of the shammpoo or contioner, but I am sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> The conditioner, left my hair very tangly, and the color started to fade within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> wow, ordered yesterday got it today...</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft silky texture to your hair, and makes it tangle-free.</li>
            <li> Keeps my color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have used it before, makes my hair so soft and managable,  also gives it volume as well as holds my color</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner and it completely cleans and conditions my hair.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and manageable for a few days after shampooing, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It definitely hydrates well, giving my parched strands much needed moisture.  </li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve wasted countless dollars on, so it&#x27;s nice to find a brand that actually delivers on its promises.  </li>
            <li> Now maybe I got one that just happened to be less full</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it is cheaper; they give out half full bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount (a nickle&#x27;s worth), rub your hands together to get it smooth, and then apply on very wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly and use a high volume of peroxide, but you&#x27;d never know it after using these products.  </li>
            <li> I always end up coming back to Pureology, even though it isn&#x27;t sold where I live, and I have to order it online.</li>
            <li> I think next time I will go back  to the Pureology Nanoworks which works just as well and has a much nicer smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine but very thick hair and as a added bonus a very sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> The only downside would be the smell and feel -- it&#x27;s like like Icy Hot.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but purchasing the bigger bottles is, in the long run, more economical than purchasing the 8 ounce size.  </li>
            <li> I not only color my hair but live in Sunny South Florida where I am out in the sun any time I go outside.</li>
            <li> Long live animals...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is hard to find a conditioner that will actually detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> If your scalp can endure 5 minutes of the tinkling sensitive (which really isn&#x27;t so bad), then you&#x27;ll probably love the conditioner as much as I do!</li>
            <li> : very fast I got it in a few days&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found that provides the right amount of hydration without making my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where the weather is very dry</li>
            <li> Good product and less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is super concentrated and very small amounts of both products do miracles on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long white hair that gets dry, and a sensitive scalp that tends to dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair has been soft even between long dry months.  </li>
            <li> Before I used this my hair showed a lot of body simply because it didn&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t make it gummy and flat.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this conditioner really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> So this 33.8 oz will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It is the only hair conditioner I will be using for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use natural products or lean towards products that at least smells natural.  </li>
            <li> Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Conditioner IS THE ONLY conditioner my hair stylist wants me to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and this leaves my hair very soft without being heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair has blonde highlights and gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve highlighted my long hair for years.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of products on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of this conditioner and just started buying it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my long thick hair so it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> All you need is a quarter sized (my hair is long) blob, it doesn&#x27;t feel all lotion-like and slippery in your hair if you&#x27;re used to conditioner feeling that way.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but lasts a long time - well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have run out of it and bought other \\&quot;color\\&quot; products locally, but nothing compares.</li>
            <li> If it is only every other day</li>
            <li> Medium to Dry</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, dry, dry and</li>
            <li> I blow dry</li>
            <li> That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product because of it&#x27;s claims to protect colored hair, but I wanted something that would work for my dry hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back to get my hair colored again a few months later and again using this product</li>
            <li> I have been using Pureology Nanoworks for the last few years and decided to try this Anti-Fade formula which was slightly less expensive after reading the reviews which said it worked better.  </li>
            <li> I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS</li>
            <li> I use because my hair just starts to feel weighed down using only one shampoo</li>
            <li> this product is the only conditioner that will tame my my hair and allow me to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super expensive</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Terax, Davines and other &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; conditioners -- I actually like this conditioner better and its a bit less expensive.  </li>
            <li> , then you should think carefully about purchasing them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but so worth it.</li>
            <li> You will pay the same price on Amazon that you would pay in a Salon for half this size!~</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount on my long hair and voila!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way since there is no water in this formula.  </li>
            <li> and I only use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> After getting a few grey hairs I decided to color my hair again.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any recommendations on any other anti-fade products.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount</li>
            <li> There are other Purelogy products for every type of hair texture too, so give this stuff a try.  </li>
            <li> Nothing at Walmart or other type store will work this well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to alternate shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I noticed several reviews stating the product they received was not what they had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that are designed for color treated hair, but this brand produces much less fading than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled frizzy, fly-away, dull hair for the last time.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair every 6-8 weeks and hardly ever the same color twice.</li>
            <li> Unlike one of the reviews which says the conditioner weighs the hair down, I did not find this to be the case.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it on Amazon because the price was less than buying at a Beauty Brands, ULTA or Salon.</li>
            <li> I used to use it when I previously colored my hair, and it still serves me well now that I no longer color my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two and a half years.</li>
            <li> and I use a half dollar size to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Hope they don&#x27;t mess with the formula</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not true anymore when using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So I got this on line to save a little money</li>
            <li> It seems like price and fancy names have little bearing on what has worked for me.</li>
            <li> A little pricy though.</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner smells totally different and the consistency is very thick and doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for over a decade for color treated and permed hair since it was one of the few sulfate fee lines.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Pureology products for your hair, you are missing out.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but not very  creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the price is at the stores</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s still not cheap even with Amazon&#x27;s lower price, I&#x27;ll probably stick with buying it at the salon (darn!).</li>
            <li> You would think that a conditioner called \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; would weight down thin hair.</li>
            <li> I lucked out and got two legitimate bottles of Pureology from Amazon, but I know others have complained about it not being the legitimate product.</li>

            <li> Sad because it actually moisturizes extremely well :-(</li>
            <li> These products are dreadfully expensive, and if you are on a very tight budget (aren&#x27;t we all?)</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> this ruined my hair, i think it is fake or expired.</li>
            <li> Another one of those details people fail to consider.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all hair types as you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I only buy products from companies that don&#x27;t torture animals in cruel experiments.  </li>
            <li> I had already bought the shampoo at the salon (very expensive that way, unfortunately)</li>
            <li> I was really mad about this; so mad, in fact, that I contacted Pureology to let them know that I had inadvertently purchased a &amp;#34;diverted&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY - THIS IS FAKE!</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The minute I put in my hand to shampoo my hair, my eyes started burning and the smell is so bad that I had to wash my hair again with another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been nothing but disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just awful.</li>
            <li> Contains methylchloroisotholisone and I am terribly allergic.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way this brand makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s helped my curls, eczema on my neck and scalp, and helps hair grow longer/healthier. I lucked out and got two legitimate bottles of Pureology from Amazon, but I know others have complained about it not being the legitimate product. I think I will buy from Pureology&#x27;s website in the future, just in case.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. I have long white hair that gets dry, and a sensitive scalp that tends to dandruff. No dandruff with Pureology, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it cost significantly less than buying it anywhere else. I love the smell of it (my hairstylist uses it and gives me a travel size of it each year at Christmas). I had already bought the shampoo at the salon (very expensive that way, unfortunately) but I will not make that mistake again.  I will only buy from here now.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair shiney and looking wonderful.  Just use a small amount (a nickle&#x27;s worth), rub your hands together to get it smooth, and then apply on very wet hair.  I have found you get the best coverage this way.  Expensive, but lasts a long time - well worth the money!  People stop me on the street and ask how I got my hair so shiney!!</li>
            <li> Positive:&lt;br /&gt;My roommate use&#x27;s this stuff and swore by it. So I tried it and love it. It has a great mint smell and works like a charm, which is saying something because I have very fine soft hair and it gets tangled just looking at it. I have tried many different products and most have not worked and if they did it was the conditioner that came with hair dying stuff.  So I got this on line to save a little money I&#x27;m not sure what the price is at the stores but I&#x27;m sure it is more.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: very fast I got it in a few days&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to use it I noticed that there was lots of room for air in it. The product was all most 2 inches below the top. Now maybe I got one that just happened to be less full but I don&#x27;t think that the amount is said in it was correct. I will buy one more time and if it is the same way I will just go to the store and buy it. Maybe that&#x27;s why it is cheaper; they give out half full bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I love the product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon and am reviewing for the product only. I&#x27;m a male, don&#x27;t color my hair BUT I like/love tingle. It&#x27;s a bonus is that this makes my hair extremely soft (yet not heavy or oily), smells mild/nice and has a good ingredient list. As of now, this is my favorite conditioner on the market!! I really, REALLY like it. The only con is maybe the packaging--it&#x27;s a bit feminine, which could put off a male buyer. Who really cares though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you are purchasing based on this review, assure that you&#x27;re purchasing the Hydrate Conditioner and not the Hydrate LIGHT Conditioner, which is good but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before but not this exact shampoo and loved it.  The minute I put in my hand to shampoo my hair, my eyes started burning and the smell is so bad that I had to wash my hair again with another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve highlighted my long hair for years. I live in Colorado where the weather is very dry so I need a product that actually conditions my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products for colored hair including Joico, Matrix, &amp; Redken. Pureology is by far superior to these other products. I purchased it on Amazon because the price was less than buying at a Beauty Brands, ULTA or Salon. Pureology&#x27;s website states that they will not guarantee products that are sold outside of exclusive salons. However, this conditioner that I bought on Amazon works amazingly well. My hair is soft and manageable and I don&#x27;t have to use a detangler or leave-in conditioner anymore! Another bonus of using Pureology is you do not have to use much at all. So this 33.8 oz will last me a long time. It&#x27;s well worth the money I bought it for. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife but actually I have to admit that I like it too. It seems to have peppermint or something in it that makes your scalp tingle.Much better that what I dragged home from my last haircut.</li>
            <li> This is as good as a drugstore brand. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll want to try it yourself anyway, then you will say \\&quot;Hey, that review I didn&#x27;t listen to was right. Ouch, I&#x27;m out $40\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and when you can get it on sale on amazon for this large bottle it is a great deal. In the store these cost around $55 bucks. I tried this once and was hooked, now everytime I use a different conditioner I dont like it because it doesnt give me the same soft and smooth hair as this does! Love it!</li>
            <li> Have used this for over a decade for color treated and permed hair since it was one of the few sulfate fee lines. Love the tingly feeling on my scalp when I leave in for 10 minutes (kind of a minty feeling).  My hairdresser has been trying to get me to stop using it since Proctor and Gamble bought it thinking they would ruin it but so far I have not detected a difference.  Hope they don&#x27;t mess with the formula (if they haven&#x27;t already) cause if I ever notice a difference I will quit it right away.</li>
            <li> The best hair conditioner there is! Makes my gray hair smooth and non-frizzy. I used to use it when I previously colored my hair, and it still serves me well now that I no longer color my hair. Use just a tiny amount. I just replaced my bottle after 2 years.</li>
            <li> Love Pureology, It is definitely a Hydrating conditioner. I have tried other brands, but keep coming back to this one. Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It make my scalp feel all tingly, has a nice Rosemary smell, and jeeps my hair soft. After I started using it my hairdresser commented on how health my hair was.</li>
            <li> Good product and less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. The product is as ordered and came extremely fast (on regular service) -- 2 days. I love the savings over buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li> I actually adore this product when it&#x27;s authentic, which this was not. I purchased this from &amp;#34;The Beauty Buy&amp;#34; online, and the conditioner worked nothing like another one I had purchased online form a different retailer. It was a very convincing imposter in terms of how it looked and smelled, but it had zero moisturizing properties. It was like I had conditioned my hair with Dawn. I was really mad about this; so mad, in fact, that I contacted Pureology to let them know that I had inadvertently purchased a &amp;#34;diverted&amp;#34; product. I also implored them to please sell this conditioner on their own website so that we consumers can enjoy the convenience of online ordering without having to worry about receiving a fake.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Received the product super fast in the mail!  Best conditioner I have ever used, and trust me I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> love it, it is the real product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty frizzy but since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff (over the last three months) it&#x27;s like the texture of my hair has changed. I say it works almost too well, b/c I&#x27;m finally beginning to understand why some people complain about having fine hair. Before I used this my hair showed a lot of body simply because it didn&#x27;t lay flat. Now it does, and sometimes it takes getting used to... like when I have my hair up in a ponytail... now that it is softer and smoother, my holder doesn&#x27;t always stay in very well! Not that I&#x27;m complaining.  I had my hair cut last week and my stylest didn&#x27;t use Pureology on my hair and I could totally tell. My hair laid like it used to, frizzed out, but now my hair is back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t really like paying the high price for this stuff, but if you can afford to spend a little more, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will buy it via Amazon. Other reviewers had a good point about issues with non-salon buys. Considering it&#x27;s still not cheap even with Amazon&#x27;s lower price, I&#x27;ll probably stick with buying it at the salon (darn!).</li>
            <li> This product is great for color treated hair.  I have used other products that are designed for color treated hair, but this brand produces much less fading than other brands.  My hair is also much healthier as well. My hairstylist is amazed at how healty my hair is despite coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two and a half years. I love it, and will never use anything else again, my hair is so soft, and it smells amazing. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this product and Pureology shampoo years ago and I&#x27;ve used it and loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have frizzy/thick hair and this product is the only conditioner that will tame my my hair and allow me to flat iron.  I can&#x27;t use anything else, and believe me I have tried many others!</li>
            <li> great product use all of their products</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great.  It has a fantastic peppermint scent, is a rich conditioner that detangles and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Conditioner was used on the following hair type...&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity: Asian&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Medium and a bit wavy&lt;br /&gt;Dryness: Medium to Dry&lt;br /&gt;Length: Long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set of shampoo and conditioner was first introduced to me by my best friend. I was skeptical at first, but this conditioner really gets the job done.  I only use a small amount on my long hair and voila!  It&#x27;s like magic.  Unlike one of the reviews which says the conditioner weighs the hair down, I did not find this to be the case.  It&#x27;s actually a very light conditioner and I only use a small amount.  The smell is fabulous!  I tend to use natural products or lean towards products that at least smells natural.  And this is it folks!  If you like the fruity scent, then this conditioner isn&#x27;t for you.  For those who have sensitive skin or scalp, this may not be the conditioner for you because it will tingle your scalp for a good 5 minutes after you rinse it off.  But I like the tingly feeling.  It makes me feel like my hair has been washed in the salon.  If your scalp can endure 5 minutes of the tinkling sensitive (which really isn&#x27;t so bad), then you&#x27;ll probably love the conditioner as much as I do!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000KQ7X8G Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Conditioner, 33.8-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product.  Don&#x27;t have to use much, great for coloured hair and give hair a beautiful shine&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> No matter how many different (and expensive) conditioners I try, I seem to keep coming back to this one...it leaves my hair smooth and less kinky, more manageable.  It is expensive, but purchasing the bigger bottles is, in the long run, more economical than purchasing the 8 ounce size.  Go for it and buy the 33 ounce size.  Heck, if I feel I&#x27;m in the money, I buy the 64 ounce size.</li>
            <li> After getting a few grey hairs I decided to color my hair again. I had not dyed my hair since I was in college which is more years ago then I care to admit. I have long hair and I was very concerned about fading, and damaging my hair. I went to a hairly rated salon my town nd got my hair colored. I was very pleased with the color and I asked for the hair stylist recommendation on which product would make sure I maintained the color the best. I purchased pureology, anti fade shampoo condition and the leave in spray. The products cost more the the coloring but I really wanted to make sure my look was maintained.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the smell of the shammpoo or contioner, but I am sensitive to smells so I thought I could live with the smell if it gave great results. I have been nothing but disappointed. The conditioner, left my hair very tangly, and the color started to fade within 2 weeks. With a month I was almost back to my prior color.&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was the color the hair dresser used. I went back to get my hair colored again a few months later and again using this product did nothing for fade and has never left my hair that shiny or salon perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any recommendations on any other anti-fade products. I have tried alot of products on my long hair. It seems like price and fancy names have little bearing on what has worked for me. If my hair is tangled, johnson no more tangles , what I use on my toddler works better then anything else, for conditioning and shine I find pantene&#x27;s mask and 3 minute miracle justas good as brands that cost 5x or more.</li>
            <li> I love this line! I have used nothing else since I bought pureology.  My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t lose color as quickly as before.</li>
            <li> Received it in a couple of days.  Hair is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any personal experience but my wife loves this conditioner.  It&#x27;s super expensive so I try to buy her some cheaper ones but she always complains about them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved pureology products and this conditioner is amazing! I have color treated hair and this leaves my hair very soft without being heavy. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> wow, ordered yesterday got it today...love this product...sells for double the price in the salon I go to. So happy to have it at home</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to convince myself to spend so much on a conditioner but now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks I would never go back.  It feels absolutely amazing when it starts tingly.  I leave it on longer than a normal person because it feels sooooo good.  My hair is naturally full of tangles and this conditioner has helped with that significantly.  I used to not be able to brush my wet hair before putting in a leave-in conditioner but that&#x27;s not true anymore when using the conditioner.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years on my color treated hair.  I have a lot of hair and it does not gunk it up.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of this conditioner and just started buying it from Amazon.  I had no problems with the shipping or the quality of the product by not buying from a beauty salon store.  One of my favorite features of this conditioner is the minty tingle!  It feels so refreshing!  Some of my friends have tried it and have not been so thrilled about the mint smell, but I don&#x27;t think they were expecting it.  The conditioner is also sulfate free (It&#x27;s actually a vegan product!)</li>
            <li> This product really does work; whether you&#x27;re buying it to control your fizzy hair, or want to use a conditioner that&#x27;s kind to your colored hair.  I&#x27;ve battled frizzy, fly-away, dull hair for the last time.  My hair finally looks healthy.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Love how good it makes my hair feel. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my long thick hair so it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I looked for years for a product that really conditioned my hair, instead of just feeling like it made it oily, and this product does the trick. I have run out of it and bought other \\&quot;color\\&quot; products locally, but nothing compares. I always end up coming back to Pureology, even though it isn&#x27;t sold where I live, and I have to order it online. I highly recommend this product, along with the hydrate shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazing price........Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Condition, 33.8 Ounce....You will pay the same price on Amazon that you would pay in a Salon for half this size!~</li>
            <li> Best conditioner EVER!!</li>
            <li> I have fine but very thick hair and as a added bonus a very sensitive scalp.  This conditioner handles my tangles great and doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair!  Plus it has a great peppermint smell!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best I have ever used.  It leaves a soft silky texture to your hair, and makes it tangle-free.</li>
            <li> My aunt is a hairdresser and recommends this product.  I love the smell (a pleasant peppermint), and it leaves my hair soft and without frizz.</li>
            <li> this ruined my hair, i think it is fake or expired. Only buy pureology products from salons.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Does what it says</li>
            <li> This has evolved into my favorite hair conditioner.  My hair is dry, dry, dry and the highlights don&#x27;t help.  Pureology Anti-Fade Conditioner seems to keep my hair healthy.  I particularily like that it doesn&#x27;t take me forever to rinse enough of it out of my hair to reach a  point where it feels clean, not gooey.  There is a strong scent, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great value.  Received on time.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Pureology products for your hair, you are missing out. They are the best.  Your hair will thank you.  I don&#x27;t really care for the minty smell, but still love the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair loves it! It smells amazing and a little goes a long way. Keeps my color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> this leave my hair shiny and lasts forever.  I am very happy with the results and have used pureology for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Conditioner IS THE ONLY conditioner my hair stylist wants me to use on my hair.  Really helps hold the color, so does the Pureology shampoo!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for curly hair! I love it &amp; recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pureology Nanoworks for the last few years and decided to try this Anti-Fade formula which was slightly less expensive after reading the reviews which said it worked better.  Well, it absolutely does.  My hair is fine and very curly; so it dries out and frizzes easily.  I have always have had to use a very good conditioner especially as I have aged and continue to color my hair.  I wash my hair as soon as I get in the shower and apply and leave in the conditioner just while I wash my body (like 1 min.) and my hair feels like silk.  I blow dry so I also use a product to protect from heat.  Love the results.  I am looking forward to trying the shampoo now!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have found. Been using for 6 years. My hair is fine and slightly wavy. I highlight it as well. This keeps it moisturized and free from damage without weighing it down. I only need a small amount each use so it lasts a long time. Love the tingling effect and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this place of business several times and the results are always the same, EXCELLENT!! Plus Pureology Hydrate is a must for my hair. I can&#x27;t live without it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Joye</li>
            <li> Favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s the best out there. Pricey, but worth it. You don&#x27;t need to have color treated hair to benefit.</li>
            <li> I not only color my hair but live in Sunny South Florida where I am out in the sun any time I go outside. This helps to keep my color consistent and my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology Hydrate Conditioner for almost 10 years.  Although I have easily tangled hair (and a lot of it!), this is a great product that keeps my hair in super shape.</li>
            <li> Have used it before, makes my hair so soft and managable,  also gives it volume as well as holds my color</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my dry, relaxed hair. Always leaves my hair smooth, moisturized, and feeling great. Highly recommend this large bottle since it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> Its smells great- like mint. It is very thick, but not very  creamy. My hair has blonde highlights and gets very dry. I felt like my hair did not absorb it well, so my hair is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like. Too pricey to not get the job done.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah...this reminds me...I need more!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair. I&#x27;ve used many conditioners but I come back to this one. It&#x27;s the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated hair and this conditioner is perfect for it. It&#x27;s the only conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found that provides the right amount of hydration without making my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Pureology products and this conditioner did not disappoint.  My hair feels amazing and I would recommend this to anyone.  In the past I have used Terax, Davines and other &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; conditioners -- I actually like this conditioner better and its a bit less expensive.  The only downside would be the smell and feel -- it&#x27;s like like Icy Hot.  It has a strong peppermint smell and when you put it on you get a cool rush similar to the feeling of using icy hot.  That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry which is why it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product because of it&#x27;s claims to protect colored hair, but I wanted something that would work for my dry hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A distinction between my review and others is WHEN I made my observations about this product. Many people assume the quality of a product based how it feels in their hair while in the shower. Tingly for shampoos is supposed to make you think \\&quot;it is working\\&quot; or slippery conditioner suggests it is hydrating your hair (the whole point). Waxy conditioners can feel great while in the shower, but your hair is as stripped as usual once your hair is dried out. Another mistake people make when reviewing a product is failing to take into account how often they wash their hair. If it is only every other day or so then it is very likely that your body&#x27;s own oil is replenishing the hair and this says nothing at all about how well a product does it&#x27;s job. I wash my hair every day, so conditioners that don&#x27;t work and leave my hair dry are very easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pricey, but works very well! It&#x27;s not going to change your life or make you irresistible to members of the opposite sex, but it does work. Instead of just coating the hair with some waxy substance this product actually seems to hydrate my hair (the only thing a conditioner SHOULD do well, color protection would be a bonus I guess). My hair is very soft for most of the day and I live in a very dry climate (Colorado, where the dew point is often -0) and work outside, which says a great deal on behalf of the product effectiveness. Another one of those details people fail to consider. If you live in New Orleans, you probably won&#x27;t have as big a moisture problem and your review should share the fact that you live in a veritable sauna, but if you live in Arizona or Colorado that is important to consider when making a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell people speak of is mild though noticeable while in the shower and maybe 5 minutes after. Not a big deal if you can wait 5 minutes for it to wear off. It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!wait 5 minutes for it to wear off. It&#x27;s a great product, but if you can find something cheaper that does the simple task a good conditioner should do, then go with that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of Pureology before, but after reading reviews about the smell I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I love the shampoo!  Smells great!  However, the conditioner smells totally different and the consistency is very thick and doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well.  I wondered why it smelled SO different from the shampoo...kind of a let down (considering the amount I paid)</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this about 2 years ago it is awesome for dry, thick, frizzy, colored hair.  There are other Purelogy products for every type of hair texture too, so give this stuff a try.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner and it completely cleans and conditions my hair.  Nothing at Walmart or other type store will work this well on my hair.  It is super concentrated and very small amounts of both products do miracles on my hair.  There are trial size bottles at Beauty Warehouse type stores, where all of the other professional hair products are sold and trust me, you will love this line of hair care products.  It is literally worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!  It&#x27;s worth money.  It makes hair smooth and silky and my favorite part is how it makes your head tingly and cold when you are washing your hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product -- great smell and works terrific</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance! Refreshing without being overly perfumed. Leaves my dry, curly hair feeling soft and healthy. Has lasted over a year and still about 1/3 full. I bought shampoo at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years!  It makes my chemically treated hair look soft and healthy - and it makes a great smelling stand in for shave gel in a pinch.  I have fine straight hair that looks dirty with too much product - this is light and perfect - and smells great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been rated very high, because it makes one&#x27;s head tingle leaving one with a completely refreshed and revitalized feeling. The  conditioner has a pleasant smell and is very rich, leaving the hair in great condition after application.  Highly recommended for both males and females, as the scent is neutral.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since my sister suggested it.  My hair has been soft even between long dry months.  I believe this conditioner has even helped carry my hair through those times when I didn&#x27;t get a haircut for over 6 months.  And it still looked shiny and clean.  So needless to say I love Pureology&#x27;s products and I love the fact that they are vegan.  Long live animals...humans included.</li>
            <li> When I first began to use Pureology products about a year ago, I was impressed with their efficacy.  However, as I am now approaching our anniversary, I am somewhat less impressed.  I have discovered that WHERE I buy the product is important.  Amazon is first-rate, but buying via a supermarket is not as reliable.  These products are dreadfully expensive, and if you are on a very tight budget (aren&#x27;t we all?), then you should think carefully about purchasing them.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a big difference between tingly and your scalp feeling like its on fire.  It felt closer to on fire for me.  very uncomfortable.  Also, extremely strong scent and that isn&#x27;t a good thing in this case.  Sad because it actually moisturizes extremely well :-(</li>
            <li> This has CHANGED my hair. My baby-fine hair loves this stuff and the minty tingle and smell are amazing.</li>
            <li> Been using this product along with their shampoo for 5 years now.  Leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and silky without weighing it down.  Plus, it is for color treated hair so it prevents fading.  I usually have to alternate shampoo&#x27;s I use because my hair just starts to feel weighed down using only one shampoo but I truly can use Pureology Hydrate every day and not feel that way.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 8 months ago. I like that it is concentrated so that offsets the cost alittle. I color my hair every 6-8 weeks and hardly ever the same color twice. so my hair needs special attention. I love the way this tingles on your head. It leaves my hair very nourished and very easy to style. I also feel like my color stays longer. It doesnt look as faded when I go for my next appointment. my hair stylist says my hair has never been healthier</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology for years and can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  The minty smell is very refreshing, leaves a great tingle on your head and leaves your hair so soft... after using this for eight weeks, my hair has turned to straw!  I bought another bottle but from the beauty salon instead of here and immediately noticed the difference in the products. DO NOT BUY - THIS IS FAKE!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel so soft, and it lathers nicely. The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and will continue to use it. Really helped with avoiding the brassy color when you highlight your hair lighter. Although, I do with it came with a pump. I purchased a pump separately.</li>
            <li> Some conditioners leave hair feeling weighty or gunky. This one leaves hair relatively light and still smooth. That&#x27;s the goal.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for my unruly hair and this stuff works consistently.  I actually like the peppermint that is in it.  Of course I have allergies and I stand in the shower breathing it in to clear my nose.  So it works two ways.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product........I have tried so many different products for my hair and this is the best!! My hair was so frizzy and lifeless before and now my hair is shiny and managed. No doubt I will use this for the rest of my life. [[ASIN:B000KQ7X4K Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Shampoo 33.8 oz]] and [[ASIN:B000KQ7X8G Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Conditioner 33.8oz]]</li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner I have ever used for my thin, frizzy hair.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> You would think that a conditioner called \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; would weight down thin hair. This is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t make it gummy and flat. All you need is a quarter sized (my hair is long) blob, it doesn&#x27;t feel all lotion-like and slippery in your hair if you&#x27;re used to conditioner feeling that way. Conditioner is supposed to be absorbed into the scalp and hair not sit on top of it and wash straight out like most do. It has a great minty aroma that stimulates your scalp. This product is totally worth the price and lasts because just a little is needed to achieve great results!</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product as I have used it for a few years now.  My hair feels and looks fabulous.  I recommend this product for all hair types as you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> have tried many products that were supposed to act as a conditioner, but this one feels and works for my &amp;#34;old Man&#x27;s&amp;#34; grey hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found. My hair is fine and color treated so it gets dry. I have no problems with dryness or over moisturizing with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised! Great price! This is by far the best conditioner for my dry curly hair I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Since this is the only conditioner I will use, this order was a reorder of a product I&#x27;ve used many times.  The product is great, and the vendor got it to us quickly and in good shape.  There&#x27;s nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Great smell and Great at detangling my hair! I have fine hair and it is hard to find a conditioner that will actually detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed several reviews stating the product they received was not what they had used in the past.  I have to say this is exactly the same as what I buy at the salon.  I love the way it smells, how it feels while it&#x27;s on my head and how it leaves my hair feeling.  It has really helped keep my hair from drying out this winter too.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works!  My hair is smooth and manageable for a few days after shampooing, but not greasy.  Smells great, and as an added benefit, the peppermint in it even helps when I have a headache.  :D</li>
            <li> Very light weight and will wake you up with that minty smell and tingle your scalp just a little.  A little goes a long way since there is no water in this formula.  I have hair to my hips and I use a half dollar size to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look good and feel good and it&#x27;s not tested on animals!  I only buy products from companies that don&#x27;t torture animals in cruel experiments.  For anyone who is interested, you can get more info at [...] or [...].  Animals shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer and die so we can look good.</li>
            <li> Great story. I recommend this series. The story engages and keeps you enraptured from beginning to dramatic and happy ending.</li>
            <li> The Pureology conditioners work well, but this one has a very strong fragrance of mint which is a bit overpowering. I think next time I will go back  to the Pureology Nanoworks which works just as well and has a much nicer smell.</li>
            <li> Pureology is devoted to color treated hair and this conditioner really does its job well.  It definitely hydrates well, giving my parched strands much needed moisture.  I also use the Hydrate shampoo and the two together do a great job for me.  I hadn&#x27;t used this line before and noticed it at Ulta and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I know that Pureology is a favorite of the makeupalley hair forum and I&#x27;ve seen it recommended numerous times.  It&#x27;s expensive but so worth it. It also smells wonderful, which is definitely a plus.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I&#x27;ve wasted countless dollars on, so it&#x27;s nice to find a brand that actually delivers on its promises.  I can truthfully say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  It&#x27;s shiny and soft and really healthy looking.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, the difference in my hair is amazing!  It looked and felt like straw before and now that&#x27;s no longer the case.  I color my hair regularly and use a high volume of peroxide, but you&#x27;d never know it after using these products.  They have transformed my hair into an almost virgin state.  I will continue to use these products and happily pay a premium for doing so.  My hubby even commented on how nice my hair looks (this was after a fantastic haircut, lol!).  The fact that he actually noticed the state of my hair means that these products are definitely working.  I knew they were but it&#x27;s nice to be on the receiving end of a compliment.  When my hair looks good, I feel like a million bucks!!  And these days, my hair looks awesomely wonderful!!  I definitely recommend this conditioner but suggest you try the Hydrate shampoo too.  Together they rock!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes my hair soft, can&#x27;t say if it helps retain color.  But Pureology has great hair care</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and smells great. A little pricy though.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this PERFECT product.  It is the only hair conditioner I will be using for a very long time.  The price is way better than the salon and the delivery has been consistently good.</li>
            <li> Contains methylchloroisotholisone and I am terribly allergic.  Itchy scalp &amp; rash on hands.</li>
