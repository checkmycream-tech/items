            <li>I should have read more to see what made this &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;I would never have purchased if I&#x27;d known it was the baby powder scent</li>
            <li>I signed up for the Amazon 3-month renewal subscription (which comes with a nice discount) - worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love the Clean Baby Scent!</li>
            <li>Vaseline brand is the best out there and as long as they make it, I will purchase it.</li>
            <li>I love the baby fresh scent even though I am using it on my own skin.  </li>
            <li>It is great when you are wearing a perfume but do not want it to be too loud.  </li>
            <li>but their brand is always available, which I have tried more than once.  </li>
            <li>I use it to take my makeup off before i wash my face, I use it to keep down flyaway hairs when I do an awesome hairstyle, I use it as chapstick, i use it to moisturize, it has so many uses.</li>
            <li>it has very mild baby powder smell to it which reminds me of well, &#x27;baby&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great deal and it&#x27;s last more han 3 months.</li>
            <li>but it can be rather strong sometimes.</li>
            <li>Huge package of it</li>
            <li>This stuff has a light baby powder scent.</li>
            <li>I needed to add something else to an order to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>lol read the actual jar it says ...</li>
            <li>Works great except one of the containers was completely open and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li>ONCE AGAIN SAME GREAT PRODUCT AS SUPERMARKET CONVIENACE OF</li>
            <li>Good old Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Everyone need it, smells good, protect,moisturize so far...</li>
            <li>I love the light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>cheap and worth it !</li>
            <li>This stuff worked wonderfully and it&#x27;s lightly scented which kept their little bums smelling sweetly and their skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I purchase so much for me, my pets, and my home from Amazon, and am thankful that so many items that I need are available.  </li>
            <li>help with dry skin and a great product for my family.</li>
            <li>when you has a rash or just dry skin this product is a great remedy.</li>
            <li>Works great against diaper rash prevention and a good alternative to expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Accurate description, fast service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant enough smell, but now it&#x27;s not 100% pure petroleum jelly.     </li>
            <li>Keeps my baby nice and moist but I don&#x27;t see the difference when compared with the regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It has been used since my mom was young :)</li>
            <li>and after only a couple weeks of applying Vaseline at every change.. he has yet to have a significant rash ever since!!</li>
            <li>We have a standing order in place for this item close to year and a half and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This really works good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>She is much more comfortable and it does not irritate her gentle nether regions as the regular vaseline does sometimes.  </li>
            <li>This should not be for babies, it has such a strong perfume smell!</li>
            <li>The baby version is soft, creamy, easy to apply, and does not require vigorous scrubbing to get off your hands.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old doesn&#x27;t complian of stickiness that much any more.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the pack of 3 a great deal, subscribing to this ensures I get it regularly in the mail even if I forget to reorder it!</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin is very sensitive but this is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Dr&#x27;s prescribed multiple treatments, on top of the usuals.. Desitin, A&amp;D, etc etc</li>
            <li>Vaseline Baby is so much better than regular vaseline.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>whatever you need to use it for, it will most likely get the job done.</li>
            <li>This is much Better than regular vaseline.</li>
            <li>My baby used to get diaper rash with regular vaseline until I realized there was Vaseline baby available!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over 20 days since I first used this</li>
            <li>INACCURATE DESCRIPTION - this product is described as fragrance free but it clearly states on the label that one of the inactive ingredients is frgrance.</li>
            <li>Feels better than the regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Amazon was the only place I seemed to be able to get this with baby scent.</li>
            <li>Vaseline has never failed his name.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the jelly is just what my skin needs especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>Has a lovely, light baby scent that gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think of anything saying 100% pure as exactly that, and don&#x27;t expect a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Actually, the baby bottom won&#x27;t be rash if you clean it right after he poop.</li>
            <li>The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out.</li>
            <li>This product is advertised as 100% pure petroleum jelly with NO fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, Baby 13 oz</li>
            <li>I have three large tubs.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever bought scented kind and not just plain Vaseline.</li>
            <li>The tub is huge and will last a while.</li>
            <li>The baby started scratching her eyes intensely.</li>
            <li>It is not as gressy and much easier to apply and spread evenly.</li>
            <li>I am very busty</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It is what I wanted, just as advertized and arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>This product got rid of the rash fast.</li>
            <li>Whatever the Vaseline brand has in it, it&#x27;s something she finds really tasty.</li>
            <li>I must not have really known what I was ordering when I bought this.</li>
            <li>but here we are with a 2nd baby, a boy, who had to spend 2 &amp; 1/2 wks in the special care nursery after he was born.. &amp;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li>Nice and thick.</li>
            <li>When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Ruined our welcome mat and was annoying to clean up.</li>
            <li>This is the only product we use and my daughter has only had a mild rash once or twice.</li>
            <li>Vaseline baby is way better than regular Vaseline when use for baby&#x27;s little bottom.</li>
            <li>I use it on myself as well as the grandchildren especially in the winter when your skin needs a little more attention to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s 8 months old..</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for a baby with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If the smell is too much for you try the regular unscented version.</li>
            <li>why would anyone go to a local pharmacy and spend 3 times as much for Vaseline....</li>
            <li>As a shaver with sensitive skin, if I should nick myself with an inferior blade or scrape or cut myself, Vaseline always does the trick to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this item to any babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>far baby likes it when I massage her bottom with it .</li>
            <li>I prefere from far Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It also helps her, at least, to be able to have a BM every day instead of twice a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, my sons and myself have dry skin and the regular vaseline is too sticky and glossy/oily, tried couple of other vaseline versions but this is the one I and my kids like.  </li>
            <li>I spray on the perfume first while I am still wet</li>
            <li>but it makes clean up a breeze... keeps anything from sticking to his poor sensitive little tush! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have expected that 13oz is so much</li>
            <li>The actual vaseline that is seen here is mega thick and smooth,</li>
            <li>Also if you are prone to heavy sweating during the summer, use vaseline after bathing to protect your hot spots.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my baby&#x27;s soft bottom and my dry skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is great when you are wearing a perfume but do not want it to be too loud.  </li>
            <li> but their brand is always available, which I have tried more than once.  </li>
            <li> I use it to take my makeup off before i wash my face, I use it to keep down flyaway hairs when I do an awesome hairstyle, I use it as chapstick, i use it to moisturize, it has so many uses.</li>
            <li> it has very mild baby powder smell to it which reminds me of well, &#x27;baby&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great deal and it&#x27;s last more han 3 months.</li>
            <li> but it can be rather strong sometimes.</li>
            <li> Huge package of it</li>
            <li> This stuff has a light baby powder scent.</li>
            <li> I needed to add something else to an order to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> lol read the actual jar it says ...</li>
            <li> Works great except one of the containers was completely open and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN SAME GREAT PRODUCT AS SUPERMARKET CONVIENACE OF</li>
            <li> Good old Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Everyone need it, smells good, protect,moisturize so far...</li>
            <li> I love the light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> cheap and worth it !</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonderfully and it&#x27;s lightly scented which kept their little bums smelling sweetly and their skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I purchase so much for me, my pets, and my home from Amazon, and am thankful that so many items that I need are available.  </li>
            <li> help with dry skin and a great product for my family.</li>
            <li> when you has a rash or just dry skin this product is a great remedy.</li>
            <li> Works great against diaper rash prevention and a good alternative to expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Accurate description, fast service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant enough smell, but now it&#x27;s not 100% pure petroleum jelly.     </li>
            <li> Keeps my baby nice and moist but I don&#x27;t see the difference when compared with the regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It has been used since my mom was young :)</li>
            <li> and after only a couple weeks of applying Vaseline at every change.. he has yet to have a significant rash ever since!!</li>
            <li> We have a standing order in place for this item close to year and a half and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This really works good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> She is much more comfortable and it does not irritate her gentle nether regions as the regular vaseline does sometimes.  </li>
            <li> This should not be for babies, it has such a strong perfume smell!</li>
            <li> The baby version is soft, creamy, easy to apply, and does not require vigorous scrubbing to get off your hands.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old doesn&#x27;t complian of stickiness that much any more.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the pack of 3 a great deal, subscribing to this ensures I get it regularly in the mail even if I forget to reorder it!</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin is very sensitive but this is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Dr&#x27;s prescribed multiple treatments, on top of the usuals.. Desitin, A&amp;D, etc etc</li>
            <li> Vaseline Baby is so much better than regular vaseline.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> whatever you need to use it for, it will most likely get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is much Better than regular vaseline.</li>
            <li> My baby used to get diaper rash with regular vaseline until I realized there was Vaseline baby available!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 20 days since I first used this</li>
            <li> INACCURATE DESCRIPTION - this product is described as fragrance free but it clearly states on the label that one of the inactive ingredients is frgrance.</li>
            <li> Feels better than the regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place I seemed to be able to get this with baby scent.</li>
            <li> Vaseline has never failed his name.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the jelly is just what my skin needs especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> Has a lovely, light baby scent that gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I think of anything saying 100% pure as exactly that, and don&#x27;t expect a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Actually, the baby bottom won&#x27;t be rash if you clean it right after he poop.</li>
            <li> The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as 100% pure petroleum jelly with NO fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, Baby 13 oz</li>
            <li> I have three large tubs.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever bought scented kind and not just plain Vaseline.</li>
            <li> The tub is huge and will last a while.</li>
            <li> The baby started scratching her eyes intensely.</li>
            <li> It is not as gressy and much easier to apply and spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I am very busty</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted, just as advertized and arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> This product got rid of the rash fast.</li>
            <li> Whatever the Vaseline brand has in it, it&#x27;s something she finds really tasty.</li>
            <li> I must not have really known what I was ordering when I bought this.</li>
            <li> but here we are with a 2nd baby, a boy, who had to spend 2 &amp; 1/2 wks in the special care nursery after he was born.. &amp;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Nice and thick.</li>
            <li> When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Ruined our welcome mat and was annoying to clean up.</li>
            <li> This is the only product we use and my daughter has only had a mild rash once or twice.</li>
            <li> Vaseline baby is way better than regular Vaseline when use for baby&#x27;s little bottom.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself as well as the grandchildren especially in the winter when your skin needs a little more attention to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s 8 months old..</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for a baby with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If the smell is too much for you try the regular unscented version.</li>
            <li> why would anyone go to a local pharmacy and spend 3 times as much for Vaseline....</li>
            <li> As a shaver with sensitive skin, if I should nick myself with an inferior blade or scrape or cut myself, Vaseline always does the trick to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item to any babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> far baby likes it when I massage her bottom with it .</li>
            <li> I prefere from far Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It also helps her, at least, to be able to have a BM every day instead of twice a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, my sons and myself have dry skin and the regular vaseline is too sticky and glossy/oily, tried couple of other vaseline versions but this is the one I and my kids like.  </li>
            <li> I spray on the perfume first while I am still wet</li>
            <li> but it makes clean up a breeze... keeps anything from sticking to his poor sensitive little tush! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have expected that 13oz is so much</li>
            <li> The actual vaseline that is seen here is mega thick and smooth,</li>
            <li> Also if you are prone to heavy sweating during the summer, use vaseline after bathing to protect your hot spots.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my baby&#x27;s soft bottom and my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is comparable to most other brands of peroleum jelly, primary fifference is the delicate perfume fragrance;  somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> OMG, how much money I could have saved, if only someone had told me about Vaseline for diaper rash when my 1st child was little?!</li>
            <li> and when I saw the main ingredient was plain ole \\&quot;white petroleum jelly\\</li>
            <li> The regular version is hard, clumpy, much more greasy and hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long time too.</li>
            <li> and his skin also doesn&#x27;t become dry that often.</li>
            <li> Place on dry lips.</li>
            <li> lasts forever,  but did not pay attention to how BIG the jar of Vaseline is--holy cow.  </li>
            <li> One mini little one will also last you a reallllllly long time.</li>
            <li> This is not true, and cannot be used for the intended purposes that I purchased it for, but now have three giant tubs of it.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thick enough that it actually feels like it&#x27;s going to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that Vaseline specific to baby should be extra gentle, so I was disappointed when I popped this open and it smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> We average a single vaseline container a month.  </li>
            <li> I have an 18 year old cat &amp; the poor thing doesn&#x27;t have a normal, unclogged pipe, if ya know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;ve got little ones!</li>
            <li> My wife and I prefer this to all other diaper rash creams.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality ..good buy as other stores  do not give you the size and the price</li>
            <li> My little sister put it in her hair when she spent the night because she thought she could use it like a leave-in conditioner over night.</li>
            <li> they apply it the lips and face lightly everyday and very little goes long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff by the bunches when my kiddos were little.  </li>
            <li> My baby loves it and so do I as it is very soft in texture not like other petroleum jelly which hardens in cold temperature.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a very, very long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> As the diaper cream is too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> and it is oily, not fit for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d known when my daughter was little, what I know now?!</li>
            <li> We would fold a tissue in half then rip it in half to use to swipe some out of the jar and then apply it to his behind.</li>
            <li> We would put some on his little behind at every diaper change to keep rash incidents down.</li>
            <li> I have no more to say.</li>
            <li> I like to use the brand \\&quot;Vaseline\\&quot; and would you believe it is difficult to get at the two local close to my home pharmacy stores ....</li>
            <li> Too small of a purchase to worry about figuring out how to return.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past two years for both my boys</li>
            <li> Not sure what  I&#x27;m going to do with three tubs of it, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for years and was having a hard time finding.</li>
            <li> It will be rash if you left it dirty for over 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Use this regularly (at least 5 times a day EVERY day) on our newborn son and we have NO complaints!</li>
            <li> well, one of the Rx creams had the nasty side effect of tearing off his poor, red, raw, broken skin if not properly washed off.. which made me deathly afraid to use on him</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time but one of the lids was broken</li>
            <li> Well, what&#x27;s wrong with trying Vaseline instead, then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sent the wrong product then tell me to send you pictures that will solve the problem I&#x27;m still waiting.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> U feel very uncomfortable after using it after bath,</li>
            <li> the poor thing ended up leaving with the worst rash</li>
            <li> The vet told me that I should try petroleum jelly so even though it sounded awful...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not realize this had a fragrance added. I think of anything saying 100% pure as exactly that, and don&#x27;t expect a fragrance. I like the shape of the containers and the way they open, and, Vaseline is Vaseline, but I would prefer no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Awesomely gigantic jar of Vaseline. We bought these in multi packs when my son was a baby. We would put some on his little behind at every diaper change to keep rash incidents down. It worked. When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly. This never irritated his skin. The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out. We would fold a tissue in half then rip it in half to use to swipe some out of the jar and then apply it to his behind. Just a little goes along way. We did this the entire time he was in regular diapers. Stopped when he went to pull-ups and potty training.</li>
            <li> We use this as a supplement and stand-alone diaper rash prevent treatment. It goes on gooey and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the LO. I don&#x27;t mind the smell but it can be rather strong sometimes.</li>
            <li> OMG, how much money I could have saved, if only someone had told me about Vaseline for diaper rash when my 1st child was little?! Granted that was 20+ yrs ago... but here we are with a 2nd baby, a boy, who had to spend 2 &amp; 1/2 wks in the special care nursery after he was born.. &amp; the poor thing ended up leaving with the worst rash I&#x27;ve ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dr&#x27;s prescribed multiple treatments, on top of the usuals.. Desitin, A&amp;D, etc etc.... well, one of the Rx creams had the nasty side effect of tearing off his poor, red, raw, broken skin if not properly washed off.. which made me deathly afraid to use on him myself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, then I read the ingredients.. and when I saw the main ingredient was plain ole \\&quot;white petroleum jelly\\&quot;... I thought... Well, what&#x27;s wrong with trying Vaseline instead, then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we did....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW... he&#x27;s 8 months old.. and after only a couple weeks of applying Vaseline at every change.. he has yet to have a significant rash ever since!! Not only that, but it makes clean up a breeze... keeps anything from sticking to his poor sensitive little tush! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d known when my daughter was little, what I know now?! Oh the pain and suffering she could have went without!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vaseline, not only for being inexpensive, but for being the miracle cure for our dear son&#x27;s poor li&#x27;l bottom! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> We have a standing order in place for this item close to year and a half and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Baby is so much better than regular vaseline.  Our baby loves baby vaseline.  She is much more comfortable and it does not irritate her gentle nether regions as the regular vaseline does sometimes.  The regular version is hard, clumpy, much more greasy and hard to wash off.  The baby version is soft, creamy, easy to apply, and does not require vigorous scrubbing to get off your hands.  We average a single vaseline container a month.  We got the 3-pack so we could have one in the bedroom, diaper bag, and family room simultaneously.  I signed up for the Amazon 3-month renewal subscription (which comes with a nice discount) - worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love the baby fresh scent even though I am using it on my own skin.  It is great when you are wearing a perfume but do not want it to be too loud.  I spray on the perfume first while I am still wet and them I will rub the Vaseline on my legs and arms.  I will use the Vaseline when I don&#x27;t use baby oil.  The vaseline is really good on your legs all of the time.  It fights the problme of ash :).</li>
            <li> It worked well for us, till we started putting it outside the diaper area (my daughter has eczema and pediatrician insisted on vaseline instead of moisturizer). The baby started scratching her eyes intensely. When we switched to a regular, fragrance-free vaseline, she stopped reaching for the eyes.   I would not recommend this product for a baby with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Scented nicely and keeps skin nice and smooth. Works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to. Huge package of it, I think it&#x27;ll last for well over a year.</li>
            <li> This is a great value from Amazon and baby version is extremely good for kids as well as adults !</li>
            <li> Vaseline baby is way better than regular Vaseline when use for baby&#x27;s little bottom. It is not as gressy and much easier to apply and spread evenly.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is possibly the best thing ever invented for beauty. I used it for so many things. I use it to take my makeup off before i wash my face, I use it to keep down flyaway hairs when I do an awesome hairstyle, I use it as chapstick, i use it to moisturize, it has so many uses. I love the vaseline brand period. Their firming lotion and cocoa butter lotions are the nicest most moisturizing things ever. The consistency is thick enough that it actually feels like it&#x27;s going to keep your skin hydrated. The actual vaseline that is seen here is mega thick and smooth, whatever you need to use it for, it will most likely get the job done. One mini little one will also last you a reallllllly long time. This product is awesome and i would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of using it, for whatever reason, because it can be used a lot of ways. I think if you give it a try for any thing, it probably wont disappoint.</li>
            <li> This is much Better than regular vaseline. My baby used to get diaper rash with regular vaseline until I realized there was Vaseline baby available! I also love the fragrance of it, it is very mild and pleasant. It&#x27;s been over 20 days since I first used this and my baby has not got a rash since then and his skin also doesn&#x27;t become dry that often. Love it!</li>
            <li> These will last awhile. I love the baby powder scent. I use this on myself. I have no kids. But the stuff is perfect for your skin. I put it on my legs and it makes my skin perfect. I want to put this on before going out in the sun I wonder if it will help me tan better. Since baby oil burns you I figured this would help in some way. Only problem with Vaseline is you need to wash it thoroughly out and off of your hands if you touch your hair this will sneak into your hair and make it so oily. All in all I love Vaseline!! This is the first time I ever bought scented kind and not just plain Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect</li>
            <li> Simply great and does what it supposed to!</li>
            <li> This Vaseline is nice  because of the scent. One word of advice though: Don&#x27;t put it in your hair. My little sister put it in her hair when she spent the night because she thought she could use it like a leave-in conditioner over night. Well, after about 10 washes, it still wouldn&#x27;t come out. We had to pour cornstarch on her hair and comb it out. That was the ONLY thing that worked....crazy situation.    I would recommend this product for your skin and to help baby bottoms.</li>
            <li> My baby loves it and so do I as it is very soft in texture not like other petroleum jelly which hardens in cold temperature.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a light baby powder scent. It&#x27;s great for those of us with dry skin. You can also use it as a night time beauty treatment for hands and feet. After bathing, apply Vaseline to your hands and feet before going to bed. Put on cotton socks and gloves and go to sleep. In the morning your will have softer skin on your hands and feet. Also if you are prone to heavy sweating during the summer, use vaseline after bathing to protect your hot spots. I am very busty so I apply vaseline to my breast area to reduce sweating. It also works great on your legs. They will have that great shine just like Beyonce&#x27;s It you have a cut or a scrape it will help it heal faster after a scab has formed. If the smell is too much for you try the regular unscented version. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> INACCURATE DESCRIPTION - this product is described as fragrance free but it clearly states on the label that one of the inactive ingredients is frgrance.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, very economical. Has a lovely, light baby scent that gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I sent the wrong product then tell me to send you pictures that will solve the problem I&#x27;m still waiting. Council will not buy from AmericaRx are crooks. I have no more to say.</li>
            <li> This really works good on dry skin. I am using this for last 5 months for my baby. P  It is just amazing.  I tried cetaphil before using this but nothing worked for my baby.  My baby&#x27;s skin is very sensitive but this is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby nice and moist but I don&#x27;t see the difference when compared with the regular Vaseline. Still a good buy.</li>
            <li> This got both my husband and me through the winter on our hands and feet!</li>
            <li> I like to use the brand \\&quot;Vaseline\\&quot; and would you believe it is difficult to get at the two local close to my home pharmacy stores .... but their brand is always available, which I have tried more than once.  But, I want Vaseline brand .. so to my trusty wonderful Amazon store I went and of course it was available and for a good price.  I purchase so much for me, my pets, and my home from Amazon, and am thankful that so many items that I need are available.  Thank You Amazon once again.</li>
            <li> Feels better than the regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Keeps my son from getting diaper rash!  We use it on him almost every time we change his diaper and he has only gotten diaper rash 2-3x and he is 14 months.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy and not a bad price it arrived well sealed and it smells great I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it, my sons and myself have dry skin and the regular vaseline is too sticky and glossy/oily, tried couple of other vaseline versions but this is the one I and my kids like.  it has very mild baby powder smell to it which reminds me of well, &#x27;baby&#x27; days.  My 8 year old doesn&#x27;t complian of stickiness that much any more.  they apply it the lips and face lightly everyday and very little goes long way.  Absolutely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as 100% pure petroleum jelly with NO fragrances.  This is not true, and cannot be used for the intended purposes that I purchased it for, but now have three giant tubs of it.  Would have bought the non baby version if this had been written up apropriately from the seller.</li>
            <li> I love the size. You can not find a jar this size for the price of this product. It is wonderful. Vaseline brand is the best out there and as long as they make it, I will purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love to use this jelly. The smell is good and it protects my baby bottom good. Should buy if you want a basic protect. Actually, the baby bottom won&#x27;t be rash if you clean it right after he poop. It will be rash if you left it dirty for over 30 mins.</li>
            <li> why would anyone go to a local pharmacy and spend 3 times as much for Vaseline....cheap and worth it !</li>
            <li> a great product for the skin . help with dry skin and a great product for my family. a good skin care product.</li>
            <li> Love the Clean Baby Scent!</li>
            <li> Good old Vaseline. Many uses. I oil my skin with it. Place on dry lips.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a moisturizer for my hands, legs and feet.  I have my hands in water a lot and this does the trick to keep them from cracking.  Use on my feet and legs after showering.  Was thrilled to find the &amp;#34;baby scent&amp;#34; here.  I&#x27;ve used this scent for years and was having a hard time finding.</li>
            <li> Gear product, I buy it all the time. great results!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the containers were that big.  They will get used over the next 5 - 10 years, because they are soooooo big.  The product seems less greasy, and has a decent scent.  Kids don&#x27;t mind it on their arms and legs.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on fingers for hours and hours after, like regular version does.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted, just as advertized and arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Amazon was the only place I seemed to be able to get this with baby scent.</li>
            <li> As a shaver with sensitive skin, if I should nick myself with an inferior blade or scrape or cut myself, Vaseline always does the trick to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I needed to add something else to an order to qualify for free shipping.  Saw this product, fit the bill price wise and it is something we use and a jar of it lasts forever,  but did not pay attention to how BIG the jar of Vaseline is--holy cow.  LOL  Nevertheless, product is good and it got me into the free shipping so all in all, fine.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the original and smells amazing so I will be purchasing this again now I keep seeing people say it smells like baby powder well yes it does look at the jar lol read the actual jar it says ...</li>
            <li> It stop the itches from dryness.  Vaseline has never failed his name.  It has been used since my mom was young :)</li>
            <li> Love the baby scent on these.  I use this instead of diaper cream. As the diaper cream is too harsh on the skin. Lasts long time too. Nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Everyone need it, smells good, protect,moisturize so far...good. It is not that sticky as regular Vaseline ... Smells wonderful. My Paed ands friends suggested this to me</li>
            <li> I use it for my feet, face, and hand daily. The quality is good and better than the one I got from the dollar store for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great lubricant to get. Works like a charm and hasn&#x27;t caused any rash yet either so I like and recommend.</li>
            <li> USE THIS SINCE I WAS IN DIAPERS</li>
            <li> Just so you know, the vaseline is scented. It&#x27;s a pleasant enough smell, but now it&#x27;s not 100% pure petroleum jelly.     I thought the price was great.</li>
            <li> The vaseline itself is good quality. It&#x27;s just the overpowering smell of baby powder that emanates from the stuff that&#x27;s the deal breaker. My advise: buy regular vaseline instead.</li>
            <li> Yes wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff by the bunches when my kiddos were little.  I wanted to make sure neither of them had any diaper rash.  This stuff worked wonderfully and it&#x27;s lightly scented which kept their little bums smelling sweetly and their skin nice and soft.  I would highly recommend this product!  Especially if you&#x27;ve got little ones!</li>
            <li> Good price using S&amp;S.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I bought 18 jars! I am a mom who like to keep products well stocked. It moisturize my daughter well. I highly recommend this product. I know I have read that parents put in baby faces. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea. I use the Eucerin for face.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this Vaseline - especially the &amp;#34;nursery&amp;#34; fragrance. I get lots of complements on the condition of my skin. Have been using for a very, very long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great except one of the containers was completely open and leaked everywhere. Ruined our welcome mat and was annoying to clean up. Too small of a purchase to worry about figuring out how to return.</li>
            <li> My wife and I prefer this to all other diaper rash creams. This is the only product we use and my daughter has only had a mild rash once or twice.</li>
            <li> Use this regularly (at least 5 times a day EVERY day) on our newborn son and we have NO complaints! Not only is the pack of 3 a great deal, subscribing to this ensures I get it regularly in the mail even if I forget to reorder it!</li>
            <li> Mom liked it. It is a good deal for sure!</li>
            <li> Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, Baby 13 oz (Pack of 3)  is good，and i love it，and i love it，and i love it，and i love it，</li>
            <li> Send a friend,very nice</li>
            <li> Love  it use it for everything now love the smell also great for baby but no rash ever n still have 1 jar left it&#x27;s been 1 yr</li>
            <li> good price and i like the larger tub since I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Accurate description, fast service!</li>
            <li> The only difference between the baby Vaseline and the regular one is that this one is fragranced with a baby powder scent. Our pediatrician also recommended us to use Vaseline for our son who has eczema, but the added fragrance in this product irritated his skin. I would not recommend this item to any babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I should have read more to see what made this &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;I would never have purchased if I&#x27;d known it was the baby powder scent that perfumes this.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have three large tubs. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this ever since I know myself.  I love the smell and the jelly is just what my skin needs especially in the winter time.  I am often told I have beautiful, clean skin and I always reply that it might be two things - my genes and Vaseline.  You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great product for babies bottom to protect against rash or anything that babies go trough during that time .</li>
            <li> The best thing in the world for a baby&#x27;s bottom to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this item in stores anymore. I love the light, fresh scent. I use it on myself as well as the grandchildren especially in the winter when your skin needs a little more attention to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> This is the only product which I use as diper barrier and has the nostalgic smell of baby powder :) .&lt;br /&gt;So far baby likes it when I massage her bottom with it .</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to most other brands of peroleum jelly, primary fifference is the delicate perfume fragrance;  somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> has a sweet, pleasant smell and has plenty of healing power. when you has a rash or just dry skin this product is a great remedy. lovin it!!!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time but one of the lids was broken</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my baby&#x27;s soft bottom and my dry skin.  It is a very good product and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN SAME GREAT PRODUCT AS SUPERMARKET CONVIENACE OF HAVING IT BROUGHT TO YOUR DOOR. YES IT MET MY EXPECTATIONS JUST LIKE I KNEW IT WOULD THATS WHY I BUY AMAZON!!1</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great deal and it&#x27;s last more han 3 months. Before i was using A&amp;D bt I prefere from far Vaseline.</li>
            <li> My son had a diaper rash, from a powder we were using. This product got rid of the rash fast. It is a lot cheaper than Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good ole Vaseline. Works great against diaper rash prevention and a good alternative to expensive brands. For the price here, it&#x27;s a steal. The tub is huge and will last a while.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality ..good buy as other stores  do not give you the size and the price....good buy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past two years for both my boys (2 yrs and 5 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This work best for diaper rash. I apply this at every diaper change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper option than those expansive diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li> I have expected that 13oz is so much and it is oily, not fit for everyday use. U feel very uncomfortable after using it after bath,</li>
            <li> Keeps the squirrels off my feeder and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This should not be for babies, it has such a strong perfume smell!</li>
            <li> I have an 18 year old cat &amp; the poor thing doesn&#x27;t have a normal, unclogged pipe, if ya know what I mean. The vet told me that I should try petroleum jelly so even though it sounded awful...I tried it. I just dipped my finger in a Vaseline tub, put a dollop in front of her nose &amp; she sniffed, then licked it off. I did that 2 to 3 times &amp; she seemed to like it. I had some generic brand petroleum jelly but she wouldn&#x27;t touch it! Whatever the Vaseline brand has in it, it&#x27;s something she finds really tasty. It also helps her, at least, to be able to have a BM every day instead of twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;These tubs are huge! I guess I didn&#x27;t see or think about what size a 13oz tub would look like. I won&#x27;t need another package of 3 for another year or two!</li>
            <li> Old school favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I must not have really known what I was ordering when I bought this. It seems to me that Vaseline specific to baby should be extra gentle, so I was disappointed when I popped this open and it smells like baby powder. Not sure what  I&#x27;m going to do with three tubs of it, but oh well. Just know it has added fragrance.</li>
            <li> It’s petroleum jelly. I’ve always thought that it was good and it still is.</li>
