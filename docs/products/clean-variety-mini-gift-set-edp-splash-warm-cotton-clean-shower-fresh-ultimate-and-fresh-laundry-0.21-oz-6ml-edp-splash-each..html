            <li>THE GOOD THING IS THAT I GOT TO TRY 5 OF THE SCENTS CARRIED BY THEM.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good buy if you want to test things out.</li>
            <li>&quot; Fresh Laundry\\&quot; smells the best to me.</li>

            <li>Anyway I liked these perfumes.</li>
            <li>so she could pick the one she liked as well.</li>
            <li>, IT WAS NICE,</li>
            <li>GIVE THIS SET A TRY AND FIND YOUR &#x27;CLEAN&#x27; SCENT !!</li>

            <li>I AM SURE THEY SMELL GREAT TOO, ITS JUST THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;  AND</li>

            <li>Would love to get more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of soaps and dryer sheets etc.</li>
            <li>I love the ways these smell.  </li>
            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>I love all your men&#x27;s clothes.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN THE CLEAN.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im allergic to most perfumes.</li>
            <li>My favorite is warm cotton and then fresh laundry!</li>
            <li>Now she always smells sparkling clean!</li>
            <li>I loved the clean Shower Fresh smell</li>
            <li>I bought this when I had found out about the clean scent and wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work for what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I own these scents and love it so much i bought these as a gift</li>
            <li>I am happy with this because I get to try out several at a very good price, before committing to a larger pricier bottle.</li>
            <li>I ACTUALLY SMELLED THE ORIGINAL CLEAN FIRST, SINCE I HAD READ SO MANY WONDERFUL REVIEWS, BUT</li>
            <li>I love the original Clean</li>
            <li>SURE WHAT IS ABOUT THE ORIGINAL CLEAN, ITS JUST NOT WHAT</li>
            <li>try this sample set before buying a full bottle - it&#x27;s a great re-gift since they all come in their own little cute</li>
            <li>My favorite is Clean cotton followed by then Clean laundry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should know better than to purchase without sniffing first!</li>
            <li>These scents are great because they simply smell....CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my stepmom who was looking for a light perfume that wouldn&#x27;t overwhelm her.  </li>
            <li>the sample kit is so cheap on amazon</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE WITH THE &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;....</li>
            <li>I WAS JUST SO EXCITED AND WANTED TO TELL THE AMAZON</li>
            <li>Excited my skin did not get reaction from these.</li>
            <li>And, after all, WHO can complain about someone in the office smelling too clean?</li>
            <li>I have wanted to try the clean line for sometime now.</li>
            <li>Not my choice for an evening out but for around the house it lingers and smells so clean.</li>
            <li>the samples because I&#x27;m looking for work-appropriate scent in this category (soapy, clean, fresh).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the days I am looking for just hints of a perfume and a perfume that smells clean (but not like a dryer sheet)</li>
            <li>I JUST LIKE A CLEAN SHOWER SCENT THAT LINGERS</li>
            <li>They all have that out-of-the-shower clean smell.</li>
            <li>BUT MAYBE MORE MODERN</li>
            <li>I LOVE CLEAN they smell so fresh especially like the fresh laundry and warm cotton</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far CLEAN fresh laundry, CLEAN shower fresh and CLEAN warm cotton are my favorites.</li>
            <li>, I WILL BE BUYING A LARGE BOTTLE OF &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;!!</li>
            <li>so this was a great way to see if I&#x27;d like the other scents.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particular favorite..</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who was interested in clean smells as opposed to flowery smells.</li>
            <li>which is rare for a perfume to do to me.</li>
            <li>I TRIED THE SHOWER FRESH</li>
            <li>I THINK IT HAS A FRESH SENT</li>
            <li>Put very little on and dab it on your clothes more so than you skin in my opinion, and keep it away from your face, because no joke, it gets more strong throughout the day or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that good product for the price</li>
            <li>This is a great sample set if you want to test out the different scents before making a bigger purchase!</li>
            <li>I love the different variety of this set.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>But if you know what perfume you want, skip this and go get what you really want!</li>
            <li>The bottles are tiny tiny but still very lovely.</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t end up liking any of them other than warm cotton (which is what I originally wanted to get).</li>
            <li>Very allergic to smells</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN REALLY WANTING TO SEE WHAT THE RAVE ABOUT THE</li>
            <li>Everyone one wants to know what is it.</li>
            <li>I liked having all of the different scents to try out before committing to a larger bottle of any of the fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I smelled like a tiny hint of lemon and clean soap.</li>
            <li>My husband, who I try to keep away from me as much as possible passed by and said Oh you smell so clean.</li>
            <li>&#x27;CLEAN&#x27;  FRAGRANCE WAS FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT HAD NO PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE SCENT......</li>
            <li>Cute little bottles which were all separately packaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sitting right next to me on the table</li>
            <li>New lotion?</li>
            <li>New soap?</li>
            <li>IT IS MY NEW FAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But overall, they pretty much smell the same.</li>
            <li>Each scent had a slight clean scent.</li>
            <li>I love perfume, but get really annoyed when coworkers complain about others wearing perfume in the office.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling a little sick lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, I really liked them.</li>
            <li> IT EVEN LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I read the descriptions of the scents and got curious</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED TO FIND IN THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT REAL</li>
            <li> but its small enough to put in your purse to refresh!</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones.</li>
            <li> Plus they send you a few other perfume samples.</li>
            <li> I am a girl who wears highly unusual expensive perfumes and usually stick with my 6 favorites.</li>
            <li> I usually flip him off even if it is a compliment.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for gross smells!</li>
            <li> I like subtle scents, don&#x27;t want to smell like an air freshener, but these just didn&#x27;t ...work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t and that was a slight disappointment.</li>
            <li> WONT LIE, WHEN I OPENED THE SET, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SMALL BOTTLE SIZES.</li>
            <li> and these were not great.  </li>
            <li> NOW, I AM ADDICTED TO THAT ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quit using the fake e-cig silver bullet and smell like heaven 24 seven.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when applied, no matter the amount, the scent just disappeared.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT LIKE IT....</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

            <li> Best fragrances ever!!!! Would love to get more.</li>
            <li> This is a great sampling of a tremendous fragrance.  I love perfume, but get really annoyed when coworkers complain about others wearing perfume in the office.  These scents are great because they simply smell....CLEAN.  And, after all, WHO can complain about someone in the office smelling too clean?</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try the clean line for sometime now. I am happy with this because I get to try out several at a very good price, before committing to a larger pricier bottle. My order came on time, and in perfect condition. I will defiantly shop from this Seller again. Oh...just from smelling out the bottles \\&quot; Fresh Laundry\\&quot; smells the best to me.</li>
            <li> Well you get 5 samples with alot of perfume in the bottles. Plus they send you a few other perfume samples. I am a girl who wears highly unusual expensive perfumes and usually stick with my 6 favorites. I read the descriptions of the scents and got curious cause I love the smell of soaps and dryer sheets etc. So I was suprised. Each scent had a slight clean scent. After it sat on for an hour it was perfect. I smelled like a tiny hint of lemon and clean soap. My husband, who I try to keep away from me as much as possible passed by and said Oh you smell so clean. New lotion? New soap? I usually flip him off even if it is a compliment. Not a suggestion ladies. Its just me. Anyway I liked these perfumes. Not my choice for an evening out but for around the house it lingers and smells so clean. If you smoke, why bother buying perfume? You will smell like smoke and also die. I quit using the fake e-cig silver bullet and smell like heaven 24 seven. Plus I wont die now. Thats it in a nut shell</li>
            <li> I love the original Clean so this was a great way to see if I&#x27;d like the other scents.  Great size for travel bag.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who was interested in clean smells as opposed to flowery smells. She works in a hospital where perfume smells are not always tolerated well by patients. Now she always smells sparkling clean!</li>
            <li> Got this for my stepmom who was looking for a light perfume that wouldn&#x27;t overwhelm her.  This fit the bill and now she can pick her favorite!</li>
            <li> These all smelled really good coming out of the bottle. Unfortunately, when applied, no matter the amount, the scent just disappeared. I like subtle scents, don&#x27;t want to smell like an air freshener, but these just didn&#x27;t ...work. It&#x27;s too bad, I really liked them. Save your money for something that lasts.</li>
            <li> Excellent service: product arrived in perfect condition as shown with very quick delivery time, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the samples because I&#x27;m looking for work-appropriate scent in this category (soapy, clean, fresh).&lt;br /&gt;I am just not a fan of these; none of them are wearable for me; they all end up smelling yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should know better than to purchase without sniffing first!</li>
            <li> I like the way I smell nice and clean, except for the fact that it actually kind of makes me nauseous... which is rare for a perfume to do to me. It&#x27;s sitting right next to me on the table and I can smell the bottles and I&#x27;m feeling a little sick lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far CLEAN fresh laundry, CLEAN shower fresh and CLEAN warm cotton are my favorites. But overall, they pretty much smell the same. Put very little on and dab it on your clothes more so than you skin in my opinion, and keep it away from your face, because no joke, it gets more strong throughout the day or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def try this sample set before buying a full bottle - it&#x27;s a great re-gift since they all come in their own little cute boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> One smells like toilet water. One smells like lemon public restroom. One smells like a dryer sheet. Beware! Very expensive for gross smells! I hate it.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean Shower Fresh smell so I wanted to see what else from this line was a good pick.&lt;br /&gt;Im glad I didnt just order a random one because I ended up only liking one other perfume of theirs.</li>
            <li> I love the ways these smell.  For the days I am looking for just hints of a perfume and a perfume that smells clean (but not like a dryer sheet) these are awesome.  Great trial sizes!</li>
            <li> I bought this when I had found out about the clean scent and wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work for what I was looking for.  I also lent it to my mom so she could pick the one she liked as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CLEAN they smell so fresh especially like the fresh laundry and warm cotton hell I love them all. don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them the sample kit is so cheap on amazon you can&#x27;t beat it...............</li>
            <li> Thought the fragrances would be lite.  Very allergic to smells and these were not great.  Had to give them away.</li>
            <li> I love all your men&#x27;s clothes. You should have a store here in NYC. you keep up the nice designs!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN REALLY WANTING TO SEE WHAT THE RAVE ABOUT THE &#x27;CLEAN&#x27;  FRAGRANCE WAS FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT HAD NO PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE SCENT......SO, I GOT THIS VARIETY SET, AND LET ME TELL YA.....I AM IN LOVE WITH THE &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;....IT IS MY NEW FAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I WONT LIE, WHEN I OPENED THE SET, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SMALL BOTTLE SIZES. THE BOX MAKES IT LOOK A LOT BIGGER. THE GOOD THING IS THAT I GOT TO TRY 5 OF THE SCENTS CARRIED BY THEM. I ACTUALLY SMELLED THE ORIGINAL CLEAN FIRST, SINCE I HAD READ SO MANY WONDERFUL REVIEWS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT LIKE IT....THEN I TRIED THE ULTIMATE, IT WAS NICE, MUCH BETTER THAN THE CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;THEN I TRIED THE SHOWER FRESH.........OH MY GOSH!!......IT SMELLS WONDERFUL....IT EVEN LASTS A LONG TIME. I COULD STILL SMELL IT HOURS LATER.... NOW, I AM ADDICTED TO THAT ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL, SINCE THEN I HAVE NOT BOTHERED TO SMELL OR TRY THE REST OF THE SCENTS THAT COME IN THE SET. I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE, BEFORE DOING THIS REVIEW. I AM SURE THEY SMELL GREAT TOO, ITS JUST THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;  AND COULD NOT WAIT TO DO THE REVIEW!  I WAS JUST SO EXCITED AND WANTED TO TELL THE AMAZON WORLD!!&lt;br /&gt; KEEP IN MIND NOW, EVERYBODY LIKES DIFFERENT SCENTS. I JUST LIKE A CLEAN SHOWER SCENT THAT LINGERS AND THAT ONE IS AMAZING...IT DELIVERS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED TO FIND IN THIS BRAND. I&#x27;M NOT REAL SURE WHAT IS ABOUT THE ORIGINAL CLEAN, ITS JUST NOT WHAT I IMAGINED IT TO BE AND SO MAYBE THAT&#x27;S WHY THEY MADE DIFFERENT VERSIONS.  GIVE THIS SET A TRY AND FIND YOUR &#x27;CLEAN&#x27; SCENT !! YOU ARE BOUND TO FIND YOURS AND THIS SET IS GREAT FOR DOING SO! IT A GREAT PRICE TOO!!&lt;br /&gt;I DO KNOW ONE THING, I WILL BE BUYING A LARGE BOTTLE OF &#x27;SHOWER FRESH&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> I liked having all of the different scents to try out before committing to a larger bottle of any of the fragrances.  Cute little bottles which were all separately packaged.  I will probably order the set again and  split the set up for stocking stuffers next year!</li>
            <li> THE GREAT PART OF THIS IS THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO WEAR THE FRAGERANCE WITHOUT SPENDING A GREAT SUM OF MONEY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS.  IT WASN&#x27;T FOR ME BUT IT COULD BE SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT LIKE.  I THINK IT HAS A FRESH SENT BUT MAYBE MORE MODERN THAN I LIKE.  I LIKE FLOWERAL AND THIS IS NOT THAT.</li>
            <li> I love the different variety of this set. They all have that out-of-the-shower clean smell. I&#x27;m knocking off 1 star because the scent doesn&#x27;t last the day...but its small enough to put in your purse to refresh! Also, its not a spray so you would have to dab it on. I don&#x27;t have a particular favorite..I guess it depends on your mood for the day. Overall, I love it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to sample all of them. Im allergic to most perfumes. Excited my skin did not get reaction from these. My favorite is Clean cotton followed by then Clean laundry.</li>
            <li> I own these scents and love it so much i bought these as a gift</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells amazing. I thought it would be a little bigger. My favorite is warm cotton and then fresh laundry! Everyone one wants to know what is it. I keep it a secret! :)</li>
            <li> The bottles are tiny tiny but still very lovely. I get complements continuallly on them. Leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product a three star rating only because my son is allergic to the scents.Other than that good product for the price</li>
            <li> This is a great sample set if you want to test out the different scents before making a bigger purchase! I personally didn&#x27;t end up liking any of them other than warm cotton (which is what I originally wanted to get). So I haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones. But perhaps I will in the future. I do wish these came with a spray. They don&#x27;t and that was a slight disappointment. But perfume atomizers don&#x27;t cost that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy if you want to test things out. But if you know what perfume you want, skip this and go get what you really want!</li>
