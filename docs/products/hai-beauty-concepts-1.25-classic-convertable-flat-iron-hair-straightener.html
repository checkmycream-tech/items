            <li>Great product, received it quickly and it perfect condition from the vendor.</li>
            <li>You can good a good 3/4 yrs out of the iron, comparable to CHI or T3.The heat</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>I am now re purchasing this straightener because it is good quality.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, consider on buying this one.</li>
            <li>Takes for EVER to heat up and doesn&#x27;t have the weight the CROC to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The straightner is a good quality product that arrived in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>My friends who borrowed mine, loved it all.</li>
            <li>WISE UP AND CHECK YOUR ORDERS.</li>
            <li>but this is still a good product and even  though it breaks often.</li>
            <li>One or two strokes and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>help keep the iron in good conditions, I do not wrap the cord around the iron to store it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s got to be that good for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Over all, it is a good value.</li>
            <li>I bought solia and they were good</li>
            <li>Good customer service from this company.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I had my original one for 7 years in PERFECT CONDITION.</li>
            <li>So glad not to have paid full price again!!!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, does a great job on my waist length hair!</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a great straightener for a great price, this one certainly is worth considering.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Outstanding Delivery time!</li>

            <li>The iron is good, but the one shipped to me (in particular) isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews.  </li>

            <li>I have now had this since January 2012 and waited to review it because I wanted to see what kind of longevity it has.  </li>
            <li>also can curl the hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job straightening my very curly hair</li>
            <li>This one is the absolute best!!</li>

            <li>It hears up quickly and evenly and works great.</li>
            <li>keeps it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is way more affordable and works better!</li>
            <li>I stepped on the old one and broke the plastic, otherwise it still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I even bought a Chi but returned it because I liked this one better.</li>
            <li>Love love love this straightener!  </li>
            <li>works great, my hair gets so hot</li>
            <li>so that wouldn&#x27;t be very cheap.</li>
            <li>Quick heat up, straightens FOR GOOD</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does a good job with my hair</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it&#x27;s still working just fine.</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li>It was more time consuming and didn&#x27;t perform. .</li>
            <li>and I love this flatiron because it is spring loaded as to help with the ease</li>

            <li>love HAI.</li>
            <li>simply the best.</li>
            <li>The updated model is even better, with a rounded edge so I can curl and flip my hair was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this straightner.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has a dial to change the temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would like to order more Hai products.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It used to take me an hour or more to straighten my hair before i found this one.</li>
            <li>Still, the results seemed to be ok.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job straightening her hair, and it is one of the better units that don&#x27;t damage her hair as much as the cheaper none ceramic types.</li>
            <li>All my friends love using it when I have it around.</li>
            <li>and it worked way better on their hair than mine.</li>
            <li>most importantly, I LOVE my hair :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay not what I was looking for</li>
            <li>once more if neded 2</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my babybliss, I also bought a Solia and I must say I love it way more than babybliss</li>
            <li>but I think I prefer the Solia more than the Hai.</li>
            <li>and I love it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Love my hai straightner.</li>
            <li>but they have been my favorite out of all I have tryed.</li>
            <li>I love how it straightens and</li>
            <li>you guys will love it</li>
            <li>So, no complaints from me.:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and my hair is thanking me for it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still pleased.</li>
            <li>CAN&amp;#34;T say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li>I love this straightner.</li>
            <li>Anyway, don&#x27;t expect magical results.</li>
            <li>This is my third one, love it!!!</li>
            <li>My first one lasted almost 15 years!!!</li>
            <li>best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is the best flat iron i have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>The Hai flat iron works wonderfully on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and very pleased w/ this product!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and dies it fast!</li>
            <li>+ years - lived by Rule #1 and have had ZERO problems, still works as good today as it did when first purchased.</li>
            <li>Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>So excited to get another HAI!</li>
            <li>I had this same HAI Classic for a good 4-5 years and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>so glad I found it here more cheap then beauty salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I spent my money wisely</li>
            <li>Flat iron came in perfect timing and works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>I was overjoyed to see it available for much cheaper and it works wonderfully, just like my first one.</li>
            <li>and I decided to get the hai instead of a new chi because its soooo much better!!</li>
            <li>(you know, when it&#x27;s SUPER important to look cute!)</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago and was very pleased at first.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of this brand and the size is perfect for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li>So far this product is working well and does a great job straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>So w/ that said, the hunt was on to find a reasonably priced iron, w/ good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot really quick and makes my hair nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>The Hai straightener heats up fast and is so easy to use and it just feels good.  </li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Conair, Remington and Chi and this is the best, quickest hair straightner for ladies with natural curly hair who like straight hair on occation.</li>
            <li>easy to use -</li>
            <li>This is a shame because I think more than a decade of regular use is a great deal.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>THIS HEATS UP FAST, LEAVES HAIR SOFT, AND IT AN AWESOME STRAIGHTENER.</li>
            <li>It sustains heat well, and it fits easily into my hand.</li>
            <li>It gets so hot and works great on my very wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener over 7 years ago and it had been working perfectly fine over all that time.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>but both of mines are from China and work fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the first but for the affordable price it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and leaves my daughter &#x27;s kinky curly hair so smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>This made my hair a lot smoother, heated a lot more quickly, and straightened my hair faster.  </li>
            <li>This powerful iron overheats easily and it&#x27;s able to melt some of its plastic parts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still just as good as my old one: heats up very quickly, has variable heat settings, swivel cord to prevent tangles, and straightens my hair without any tugging or frizz.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly, feels solid, and works great.</li>
            <li>I had always used cheap straighteners from Target, etc, but they wouldn&#x27;t quite straighten out all my hair (fine, color-treated, abused hair) and keep it that way all day.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have ever used, super powerful and does not feel like it&#x27;s ruining my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is great especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Your hair will look silky and smooth upon hairstyling.</li>
            <li>well, it felt cheap, the plates didn&#x27;t come fully together, and I had to pass it like 6 times to get hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I confirmed the email address, and they told me I must not have sent it because they would have received it.  </li>
            <li>I have had this iron prior to buying this one on Amazon, and it worked great...</li>
            <li>It is working GREAT, does not burn my hair and straightens in only one pass!  </li>
            <li>Also, another great plus is that it takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my entire head of hair</li>
            <li>I had never straightened my hair before, but this makes it really smooth, sleek and</li>
            <li>The connector stop working, where the light flickers and I have to position the cord</li>
            <li>Throw away those cheap Conair brands you have and put this on your shopping list.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of this one, it seemed that overall everyone was happy.</li>
            <li>Light starts flashing when it is heated to the temp you set it for.</li>
            <li>The gold one felt cheap.  </li>
            <li>, I bought it, its worth the money, better than the CHI</li>
            <li>It started off as a winner--better and cheaper than the CHI--but after having it for about a year, the light started going on the fritz.  </li>
            <li>After seeing my wife go through cheap flat-iron after cheap flat-iron, I ordered this for her.  </li>
            <li>I liked so much I bought another for traveling.</li>
            <li>Im a bit dissatisfied with how cheap it feels.</li>
            <li>I just tried it and it made my hair shiny,soft,and fizz free.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>I did just get it a couple of weeks ago, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Was pretty good for the first six months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>My hair is curly &amp; kinky &amp; it made it super silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Ive used many and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>So happy to see it is still available, as I will buy it again anyway over a CHI or other brand name.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even certain that HAI would honor the warranty on this sold through discountjungle, ask them directly to be sure.</li>
            <li>I love my new straightner!!  </li>
            <li>I love the fast heat up.</li>
            <li>Love the straightener because it gets hot extremely quickly (in less than a minute at the highest setting)and works great.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and the price was right!</li>
            <li>My first great flat iron was a HAI, but after it broke, I tried and CHI and one of those mall kiosk brands.</li>
            <li>I like this flat iron; the iron is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality flat iron</li>
            <li>I have used Hai for years and it is good quality and compares to the mos pricey of flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved these flat irons.</li>
            <li>My hair looks SO good since I have been using this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I think this new one doesn&#x27;t get the hair as smooth nor does it have a good weight in my hand like the old one.</li>
            <li>received really quickly packaged well.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly without any problem.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, too.</li>

            <li>I did more research, and found the highly rated Jilbere Nano Ceramic one...</li>
            <li>She will enjoy it very much</li>
            <li>and i approve :) highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It gets really hot for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron and was glad to find it.</li>
            <li>But she did say that investing in a good flat iron was worth it.</li>
            <li>Works great, straightens my hair very fast, flat iron gets very hot very fast, it does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how perfect this flat iron is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times and it&#x27;s still intact and looks new; sort of.  </li>
            <li>It was fast and easy to used   </li>
            <li>Love it and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was described!  </li>
            <li>I always thought that the only way to keep my hair from getting frizzy from humidity when it was straight was but making sure it was hydrated and super healthy (which never happens).</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>, it is the best one out there, I have fluffy hair and it flattens it out, I get tons of compliments, takes only 5 minutes to make is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast &amp; leaves my hair looking smooth.</li>
            <li>heats up fast, no frizz, leaves a shiny smooth look.</li>
            <li>The light to indicate when it&#x27;s heated is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>i had a rusk flat iron berfore and that 1 is way better!</li>
            <li>If you can put up with that, then this iron is definitely worth the  money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reliable flat iron for sure!</li>
            <li>For the price you pay, its so worth it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product hope it does last a good time and wood buy</li>
            <li>I believe it was still the authentic HAI, it looked identical to my old one but something changed in their manufacturing.</li>
            <li>With Hai, I can finally straighten my hair on my own (not that I want to do it often).</li>
            <li>They are super hot, but the ceramic heated plates has not damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING flat iron.</li>
            <li>I bought the same exact model because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty good, especially because I used it so much.</li>
            <li>As described and came right as scheduled</li>
            <li>Does the job with no problem at the right price.</li>
            <li>just right for it to stay on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moral: buy this, treat it right.</li>
            <li>but right when I got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Ceramic Flat Irons but this is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reliable, heats up quickly, and makes your hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided on the Hai because I had had one years and years ago, and was extremely happy with it, but because of reviews from customers saying they weren&#x27;t built the same, and they were cheaper built now, I was hesitant to buy another one.</li>
            <li>Had one previously and loved it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and it was packaged well too.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the way it performs - if it didn&#x27;t pull out my hair I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Again I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>This Hai Convertable heats up super fast, and flattens with ease (section your thick hair of course), makes your hair shiny smooth - You&#x27;ll LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>but it is pretty hot to the touch after a bit.  </li>
            <li>I told them that I thought they should pay the shipping because it was within warranty,and I was going to have to ship it and pay for that to them and already paid shippping when I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t has hot as the one I had before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this same exact product before and the iron was hotter therefore straightened better.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s pretty affordable.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I am on my third Hai Convertible Iron in 5 years, they do only last 1.5 years, but for the price, it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>About a week after having the product it stopped getting as hot and stopped straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick course hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I hope they get exactly what they deserve.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought it was in 2005 for $125.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted me 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I had my first one for about 6 years before I blew the fuse on it when I was traveling in NZ and forgot to use a converter.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>At first it let off a burning smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible there are better ones out there</li>
            <li>It gets hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted 6-7 years but eventually the ceramic wore out</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-It gets really hot</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>the actual straightening part is ok its the snagging and pulling I cant deal with.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>These always break on me after about 12-14 months, never fails.</li>
            <li>first one just broke after 2 years&lt;</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>Very reliable!</li>
            <li>Makes a  big diffrence in the way I style my clients hair with soft,bouncy,&lt;br /&gt;silky healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and it is always the first tool they go to.</li>
            <li>Heats up Fast!.</li>
            <li>thank you so much Amazon!</li>
            <li>Best straightener I have had yet, and believe me I am a girl with weird kinks and curls in her hair.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted probably about 3 years.</li>
            <li>The ceramic never wore off my first HAI.</li>
            <li>If you see the blue ceramic wearing off your plates and it is during the warranty period, be sure to contact HAI for a replacement as the metal under the coating will fry your hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would give it 1 more star is an auto shut off..</li>
            <li>It produces great results and is convenient to use on short or long hair</li>
            <li>Not to mention you may have to use a higher temperature, which I find troubling.</li>
            <li>It always heated right away and straightened my hair really well, including the shine it gave.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much that I got 2!  </li>
            <li>Flat iron is OK....</li>
            <li>This is a top quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this flat Iron.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron..</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>and she said it was better than the chi flat iron</li>
            <li>so i was glad i got this flat iron</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron ..</li>
            <li>but there are better flat irons out there.</li>
            <li>I Love this Hai Ceramic Flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset that I broke such a reliable product, but happy to see that it was still being sold on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these flat irons!</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of flat irons!</li>
            <li>is perfect for thick or coarse hair and the plates dont pull or cause damage.</li>
            <li>The green light just turns on, contact the seller for a replacement and since it has been more than 30days</li>
            <li>I have relatively straight her to begin with, so I&#x27;m able to keep the heat at a low temperature and still achieve straighter hair.  </li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up and leaves hair smooth and silky; however, the heat/ceramic plate isn&#x27;t as hot as the other Hai Classic</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li>So maybe spending more money on a flat iron is a smart thing to do.</li>
            <li>so when I sweat or its hot outside, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizzier nearly as easy as it use to.</li>
            <li>This straightener works very well, heats up fast, and had many different heat settings.</li>
            <li>Just as hot and fast as the Croc.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything is good so far.</li>
            <li>this is my absolute favorite flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a flat iron spray and so i get build up from that, which it wipes off very easily which is nice.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it online for about half the price.  </li>
            <li>She said the cheaper flat irons do get very hot, but do not give off the right kind of heat, which results in damage, and less than stellar results.  </li>
            <li>Huge quality difference compared to the cheap conair one I had previously.</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up quickly and is very hot.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn, right?</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I did not purchase these flat ions from Amazon ($200 bucks 9 years ago), however, this is a great price for a pair of flat irons that will last you along time with proper care and reveal fantastic results!</li>
            <li>Hope I can always get this particular iron!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>This straightener does not straighten really curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys, but I was just under 50lbs.</li>
            <li>then the red light started flashing on and off and the plates kept turning off.  </li>
            <li>.. Makes the hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is also very well made.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product - my friend used it at my bachelorette party in Vegas</li>
            <li>the heating is fast and adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(hair keeps straight alllll day and night), doesn&#x27;t snag hair as much as the cheap-o brands.</li>
            <li>Has really burnt the</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of my Favorites</li>
            <li>It heats up fast every time and you can have the temprature up to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>and I can get my hair stick straight.  </li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to return so I will use it until it croaks.</li>
            <li>Much prefer Solia and Chi products to this.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this item.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the price this time .</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener in hopes of having healthier hair (ironic, I know) and in the month</li>
            <li>You can really tell a difference between this straightener and the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>and they were very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no complaints and i will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product as it has the type of electrical connection that makes it easy to connect to the same outlet as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I did extensive research to buy the best possible flat iron, because my daughter has kinky curly hair, and I wanted an iron that left hair straight and glossy without frying it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this flat iron works well for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this product; it glides through your hair and makes it behave.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite straightner I have ever bought, however, the product began to lose its heat after about 4 months, using it probably every to every other day.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this, for a girl that has been using this tool for the last 10 years, its worth it!</li>
            <li>I decided on this (it was given great reviews) rather than my favorite brand OnePass, and was disappointed.</li>
            <li>I found the Hai Classic and am very grateful that I found it.</li>
            <li>It was a good product at first, but after a while it made my hair worse.</li>
            <li>I bought the 2nd one 8/26/10 and used it just as much as my old one that I&#x27;d had for 4-5 years except this time around it worked great until the blue ceramic coating started wearing off of the plates earlier this summer (2012).</li>
            <li>ALSO MORE AFFORDABLE THAN OTHER BRANDS!</li>
            <li>Just needed a new one now!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this flat iron ten years ago at a local beauty supply store about 10 years ago for MUCH more.</li>
            <li>... however, my previous model, and I don&#x27;t remember the model name, was straightening my hair better than this one.</li>
            <li>however i was able to get it here for half the price</li>
            <li>It left her hair looking like straw, and freezed up quickly.</li>
            <li>I may order again but most likely will purchase from a local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same as the first one I had</li>
            <li>thick hair love it worth the money</li>
            <li>It feels sturdy and looks very well made, looks very professional too.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, mostly straight hair that usually responds well to straighteners.</li>
            <li>It gets nice and hot, which is great for my thick hair; very little time is spent straightening my hair!</li>
            <li>the first and only time I have used it,  it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The construction is also high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and bought one for my mom and sister.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than my last flat iron</li>
            <li>After using the HAI for about 10 years and being loyal, I am going to have to try another flat iron.</li>
            <li>I need a very hot, high powered flat iron which this is not.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft straight, but with volume.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the $65 price tag for a straightener that leaves hair straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this lovely hair tool will last me.</li>
            <li>I am African American and it not only makes my hair look nice, it helps keep mostiure in my hair</li>
            <li>I also got it for a cheaper price than it normally sells in salons.</li>
            <li>My hair is very course and this flat iron can get my hair very straight.</li>
            <li>I loved it, dropped it at least 10 times, to the point that even one of the plates popped out and it snapped back in and worked like a charm for a few more months.</li>
            <li>When putting iron away after its cool, loosely fold cord according to the curves already in the cord.</li>
            <li>While it is covered under the warranty, I have to pay to ship it and then have to pay HAI $14.95 to send me a new one.</li>
            <li>so here I am ordering a new one.</li>
            <li>Ordered the new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>and I will probably continue buying this straightener every time I need a new one.</li>
            <li>If I could afford a new one, I would replace this one in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>and she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>I looked on amazon for a new one but</li>
            <li>I went to a new salon about a year ago and got a hair cut.</li>
            <li>This new one Is made in China.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this item in January, have only had it for 4month and hardly used it brand new and in good condition and just stopped heating up.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and it&#x27;s simple design</li>
            <li>This new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one.</li>
            <li>I usually buy a Chi and that works so much better.</li>
            <li>it doesnt get hot enough.</li>
            <li>this hot iron is for my wife she loves it and stays off my back</li>
            <li>It got really hot and then turned off and now it will not turn back on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that with my first one, and that&#x27;s why I had to buy a second.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands (chi, T3, hot tools, Paul Mitchell, etc)</li>
            <li>I broke my first one and bought a second one.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more in the past .</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve owned it so far I have noticed a difference!  </li>
            <li>and so this gets plenty hot enough (and some) for me.</li>
            <li>I am able to strighten my hair with ease and you don&#x27;t have to constantly got over the same area to get it flat.</li>
            <li>They also could give me no extimate or timeline of a turnaround with the new or fixed straightener.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 3 years and this second one 4 years so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that at first because the chi was a step up from my walmart flat iron(literally an iron!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my first Hai flat iron for 6 year before I dropped it on my ceramic floor and broke it.</li>
            <li>I love my new straightener, my hair is really thick.</li>
            <li>I find that my hair looks better the next day (less puffy).</li>
            <li>First, let me began to say that I have had these flat irons for ALMOST 10 YEARS now!</li>
            <li>This flat iron did not last as long as it should if it would have been an authentic Hai brand.</li>
            <li>I use this in my professional salon.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair, and this straightener really only damaged my hair completey and caused it to frizz up after an hour.</li>
            <li>I received it for Christmas and on May 17th it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>but it was old.</li>
            <li>It still works but being so old it doesn&#x27;t turn on from time to time.</li>
            <li>If you move the cord around it works sometimes, but mine just now completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>They then told me to call HAI directly</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural stubborn wave that requires I iron it twice---sometimes three times in stubborn areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of Hair that is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>and it only takes about 20 minutes to get my hair stick and shiny straight.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the old one which was stolen.  </li>
            <li>Snags on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting straight style.</li>
            <li>but when I go out I like my hair to be extra straight and with this iron</li>
            <li>but actually this iron made her hair straight</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>Replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair like her old one did.</li>
            <li>Of course it was no longer under warranty so after much research I purchased a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium off Amazon last week.</li>
            <li>so I think this is old inventory as well.</li>
            <li>I am a male with 28 inches of real grown out hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would have kept my old one.</li>
            <li>It has blades with curved edges so you can put a soft curl at the end of your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like my old one but isn&#x27;t made in Korea.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t order a replacement fast enough.</li>
            <li>My old one lasted over 4 years.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted---gentle to my hair---but takes the uneven curl out---and leaves my hair shinny and straight !</li>
            <li>This was the first flat iron I bought that worked on my extremely curly coarse red hair (imagine Macy Gray and Carrot Top having kids).  </li>
            <li>Loved my HAI until this happened and sorry - not going to risk it happening again</li>
            <li>so if you want the original product   make sure it has an \\&quot;R\\&quot; next to the logo and not a \\&quot;TM\\&quot;  Also guarantee is useless with the TM product.   </li>
            <li>My wife wanted a new flat iron and this came highly recommend from her hair stylist -</li>
            <li>i really didnt like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron makes my hair perfectly straight and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>and I have owned flat irons that cost 3 times as much</li>
            <li>I need something that can keep my hair from frizzing right back up after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I can straighten my hair in half the time is used to take me.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>Having chemically straightened my hair for years now, I would highly recommend using a serum, especially at your ends, to protect your hair.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>Major difference!</li>
            <li>I asked why 9 dollars, and they said to pay for shipping for a fixed/and or new straightner back to me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I only rate it 4 stars because there are more expensive units that may be better in terms of less drying out of the hair.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was a little wider because my hair is long but the 1 1/4 width makes it more versatile.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot and cheaper here than other places.</li>
            <li>second flat iron of the exact same model</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t live without a Hai Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is left soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I owned this same straightener for about 2 years and used it every day before my old one died.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T leave the cord wrapped around the straightener, especially when you study abroad for a year and decide to go ~all natural~ for your time there.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how big the difference was.  </li>
            <li>This seemed ok when I received it however, the temperature gauge seems to be broken.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Hai Classic Convertible Ceramic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>My kids - especially my teenaged son who is a fanatic about his hair - love the Hair flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, Hai is better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron for my niece because i bought this exact same flat iron for my self back in 06</li>
            <li>I really should have listened to other reviews.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li>My old flat iron lasted ages and was sturdy as a rock.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and gets very big in humidity especially.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews from various websites and reviews on Amazon too, I decided to step up my game and pay a bit more for a Hai.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, fine hair which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to being straigtened.  </li>
            <li>As long as I also use Kerastase oleo relax slim, this flat iron does the job and keeps my hair straight all day long in the humid Georgia summers.</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron to replace my old HAI flat iron which lasted me 4 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied since the item is almost new and hardly used it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my previous flat iron (exact same one) when it died on me after 7 years.</li>
            <li>They are very smooth and don&#x27;t catch the hair on any weird edges.</li>
            <li>Discount Jungle had fast shipping though the price of it could have been a little lower considering it was being shipped from within my same city!</li>
            <li>This is the only flat iron i&#x27;ve used that does not dry out my hair or make it frizzy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, consider on buying this one.</li>
            <li> Takes for EVER to heat up and doesn&#x27;t have the weight the CROC to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The straightner is a good quality product that arrived in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> My friends who borrowed mine, loved it all.</li>
            <li> WISE UP AND CHECK YOUR ORDERS.</li>
            <li> but this is still a good product and even  though it breaks often.</li>
            <li> One or two strokes and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> help keep the iron in good conditions, I do not wrap the cord around the iron to store it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s got to be that good for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over all, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I bought solia and they were good</li>
            <li> Good customer service from this company.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I had my original one for 7 years in PERFECT CONDITION.</li>
            <li> So glad not to have paid full price again!!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, does a great job on my waist length hair!</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a great straightener for a great price, this one certainly is worth considering.</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Outstanding Delivery time!</li>

            <li> The iron is good, but the one shipped to me (in particular) isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews.  </li>

            <li> Very practical and works great!  </li>
            <li> I have now had this since January 2012 and waited to review it because I wanted to see what kind of longevity it has.  </li>
            <li> also can curl the hair nicely.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job straightening my very curly hair</li>
            <li> This one is the absolute best!!</li>

            <li> It hears up quickly and evenly and works great.</li>
            <li> keeps it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is way more affordable and works better!</li>
            <li> I stepped on the old one and broke the plastic, otherwise it still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I even bought a Chi but returned it because I liked this one better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this straightener!  </li>
            <li> works great, my hair gets so hot</li>
            <li> so that wouldn&#x27;t be very cheap.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up, straightens FOR GOOD</li>

            <li> simply the best.</li>
            <li> The updated model is even better, with a rounded edge so I can curl and flip my hair was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has a dial to change the temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would like to order more Hai products.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It used to take me an hour or more to straighten my hair before i found this one.</li>
            <li> Still, the results seemed to be ok.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job straightening her hair, and it is one of the better units that don&#x27;t damage her hair as much as the cheaper none ceramic types.</li>
            <li> All my friends love using it when I have it around.</li>
            <li> and it worked way better on their hair than mine.</li>
            <li> most importantly, I LOVE my hair :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> once more if neded 2</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my babybliss, I also bought a Solia and I must say I love it way more than babybliss</li>
            <li> but I think I prefer the Solia more than the Hai.</li>
            <li> and I love it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Love my hai straightner.</li>
            <li> but they have been my favorite out of all I have tryed.</li>
            <li> I love how it straightens and</li>
            <li> you guys will love it</li>
            <li> So, no complaints from me.:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and my hair is thanking me for it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still pleased.</li>
            <li> CAN&amp;#34;T say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I love this straightner.</li>
            <li> Anyway, don&#x27;t expect magical results.</li>
            <li> This is my third one, love it!!!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted almost 15 years!!!</li>

            <li> The Hai flat iron works wonderfully on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and very pleased w/ this product!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and dies it fast!</li>
            <li> + years - lived by Rule #1 and have had ZERO problems, still works as good today as it did when first purchased.</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> So excited to get another HAI!</li>
            <li> I had this same HAI Classic for a good 4-5 years and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> so glad I found it here more cheap then beauty salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I spent my money wisely</li>
            <li> Flat iron came in perfect timing and works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I was overjoyed to see it available for much cheaper and it works wonderfully, just like my first one.</li>
            <li> and I decided to get the hai instead of a new chi because its soooo much better!!</li>
            <li> (you know, when it&#x27;s SUPER important to look cute!)</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and was very pleased at first.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this brand and the size is perfect for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> So far this product is working well and does a great job straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> So w/ that said, the hunt was on to find a reasonably priced iron, w/ good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot really quick and makes my hair nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> The Hai straightener heats up fast and is so easy to use and it just feels good.  </li>
            <li> It also heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Conair, Remington and Chi and this is the best, quickest hair straightner for ladies with natural curly hair who like straight hair on occation.</li>
            <li> easy to use -</li>
            <li> This is a shame because I think more than a decade of regular use is a great deal.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> THIS HEATS UP FAST, LEAVES HAIR SOFT, AND IT AN AWESOME STRAIGHTENER.</li>
            <li> It sustains heat well, and it fits easily into my hand.</li>
            <li> It gets so hot and works great on my very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener over 7 years ago and it had been working perfectly fine over all that time.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> but both of mines are from China and work fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the first but for the affordable price it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and leaves my daughter &#x27;s kinky curly hair so smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> This made my hair a lot smoother, heated a lot more quickly, and straightened my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> This powerful iron overheats easily and it&#x27;s able to melt some of its plastic parts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still just as good as my old one: heats up very quickly, has variable heat settings, swivel cord to prevent tangles, and straightens my hair without any tugging or frizz.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly, feels solid, and works great.</li>
            <li> I had always used cheap straighteners from Target, etc, but they wouldn&#x27;t quite straighten out all my hair (fine, color-treated, abused hair) and keep it that way all day.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever used, super powerful and does not feel like it&#x27;s ruining my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Your hair will look silky and smooth upon hairstyling.</li>
            <li> well, it felt cheap, the plates didn&#x27;t come fully together, and I had to pass it like 6 times to get hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I confirmed the email address, and they told me I must not have sent it because they would have received it.  </li>
            <li> I have had this iron prior to buying this one on Amazon, and it worked great...</li>
            <li> It is working GREAT, does not burn my hair and straightens in only one pass!  </li>
            <li> Also, another great plus is that it takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my entire head of hair</li>
            <li> I had never straightened my hair before, but this makes it really smooth, sleek and</li>
            <li> The connector stop working, where the light flickers and I have to position the cord</li>
            <li> Throw away those cheap Conair brands you have and put this on your shopping list.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of this one, it seemed that overall everyone was happy.</li>
            <li> Light starts flashing when it is heated to the temp you set it for.</li>
            <li> The gold one felt cheap.  </li>
            <li> , I bought it, its worth the money, better than the CHI</li>
            <li> It started off as a winner--better and cheaper than the CHI--but after having it for about a year, the light started going on the fritz.  </li>
            <li> After seeing my wife go through cheap flat-iron after cheap flat-iron, I ordered this for her.  </li>
            <li> I liked so much I bought another for traveling.</li>
            <li> Im a bit dissatisfied with how cheap it feels.</li>
            <li> I just tried it and it made my hair shiny,soft,and fizz free.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> I did just get it a couple of weeks ago, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Was pretty good for the first six months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was in love, but i wasn&#x27;t just going to go buy another flat iron just because i liked it more than my chi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous flat iron at a great price.  </li>
            <li> This Hai flat iron was the best price on the web and shipping was fast as promised.  </li>

            <li> It heats up quick and is easy on her hair.</li>
            <li> This unit heated quickly, was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am very much against the Chi I bought of Amazon, but I am in love with the Hai Convertible has been a hit with me.  </li>
            <li> it heats up very quickly which is handy on busy mornings</li>
            <li> It is perfect because it heats up quick and cools down quick.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, gets hotter than most other brands, and works great for them.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Definently worth the money!</li>
            <li> I resent the original email to prove my point.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited for all the reviews,  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener, it works really well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>

            <li> heats QUICKLY, straightens and curls very easily, leaves hair with a nice shine - im constantly getting compliments asking what products/etc i use.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly &amp; kinky &amp; it made it super silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Ive used many and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> So happy to see it is still available, as I will buy it again anyway over a CHI or other brand name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even certain that HAI would honor the warranty on this sold through discountjungle, ask them directly to be sure.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightner!!  </li>
            <li> I love the fast heat up.</li>
            <li> Love the straightener because it gets hot extremely quickly (in less than a minute at the highest setting)and works great.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly and the price was right!</li>
            <li> My first great flat iron was a HAI, but after it broke, I tried and CHI and one of those mall kiosk brands.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron; the iron is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality flat iron</li>
            <li> I have used Hai for years and it is good quality and compares to the mos pricey of flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always loved these flat irons.</li>
            <li> My hair looks SO good since I have been using this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I think this new one doesn&#x27;t get the hair as smooth nor does it have a good weight in my hand like the old one.</li>
            <li> received really quickly packaged well.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>

            <li> I did more research, and found the highly rated Jilbere Nano Ceramic one...</li>
            <li> She will enjoy it very much</li>
            <li> and i approve :) highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It gets really hot for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron and was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> But she did say that investing in a good flat iron was worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great, straightens my hair very fast, flat iron gets very hot very fast, it does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how perfect this flat iron is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times and it&#x27;s still intact and looks new; sort of.  </li>
            <li> It was fast and easy to used   </li>
            <li> Love it and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was described!  </li>
            <li> I always thought that the only way to keep my hair from getting frizzy from humidity when it was straight was but making sure it was hydrated and super healthy (which never happens).</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> , it is the best one out there, I have fluffy hair and it flattens it out, I get tons of compliments, takes only 5 minutes to make is silky smooth.  </li>

            <li> The light to indicate when it&#x27;s heated is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> i had a rusk flat iron berfore and that 1 is way better!</li>
            <li> If you can put up with that, then this iron is definitely worth the  money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reliable flat iron for sure!</li>
            <li> For the price you pay, its so worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product hope it does last a good time and wood buy</li>
            <li> I believe it was still the authentic HAI, it looked identical to my old one but something changed in their manufacturing.</li>
            <li> With Hai, I can finally straighten my hair on my own (not that I want to do it often).</li>
            <li> They are super hot, but the ceramic heated plates has not damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought the same exact model because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s pretty good, especially because I used it so much.</li>
            <li> As described and came right as scheduled</li>
            <li> Does the job with no problem at the right price.</li>
            <li> just right for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral: buy this, treat it right.</li>
            <li> but right when I got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Ceramic Flat Irons but this is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reliable, heats up quickly, and makes your hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided on the Hai because I had had one years and years ago, and was extremely happy with it, but because of reviews from customers saying they weren&#x27;t built the same, and they were cheaper built now, I was hesitant to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Had one previously and loved it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair super straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and it was packaged well too.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the way it performs - if it didn&#x27;t pull out my hair I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Again I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> This Hai Convertable heats up super fast, and flattens with ease (section your thick hair of course), makes your hair shiny smooth - You&#x27;ll LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> but it is pretty hot to the touch after a bit.  </li>
            <li> I told them that I thought they should pay the shipping because it was within warranty,and I was going to have to ship it and pay for that to them and already paid shippping when I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t has hot as the one I had before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same exact product before and the iron was hotter therefore straightened better.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s pretty affordable.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third Hai Convertible Iron in 5 years, they do only last 1.5 years, but for the price, it is excellent.  </li>
            <li> About a week after having the product it stopped getting as hot and stopped straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I hope they get exactly what they deserve.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought it was in 2005 for $125.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted me 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I had my first one for about 6 years before I blew the fuse on it when I was traveling in NZ and forgot to use a converter.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> At first it let off a burning smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible there are better ones out there</li>
            <li> It gets hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6-7 years but eventually the ceramic wore out</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-It gets really hot</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> the actual straightening part is ok its the snagging and pulling I cant deal with.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> These always break on me after about 12-14 months, never fails.</li>
            <li> first one just broke after 2 years&lt;</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> Very reliable!</li>
            <li> Makes a  big diffrence in the way I style my clients hair with soft,bouncy,&lt;br /&gt;silky healthy hair.</li>
            <li> and it is always the first tool they go to.</li>
            <li> Heats up Fast!.</li>
            <li> thank you so much Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have had yet, and believe me I am a girl with weird kinks and curls in her hair.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted probably about 3 years.</li>
            <li> The ceramic never wore off my first HAI.</li>
            <li> If you see the blue ceramic wearing off your plates and it is during the warranty period, be sure to contact HAI for a replacement as the metal under the coating will fry your hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would give it 1 more star is an auto shut off..</li>
            <li> It produces great results and is convenient to use on short or long hair</li>
            <li> Not to mention you may have to use a higher temperature, which I find troubling.</li>
            <li> It always heated right away and straightened my hair really well, including the shine it gave.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much that I got 2!  </li>
            <li> Flat iron is OK....</li>
            <li> This is a top quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this flat Iron.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron..</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and she said it was better than the chi flat iron</li>
            <li> so i was glad i got this flat iron</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron ..</li>
            <li> but there are better flat irons out there.</li>
            <li> I Love this Hai Ceramic Flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset that I broke such a reliable product, but happy to see that it was still being sold on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these flat irons!</li>
            <li> My favorite brand of flat irons!</li>
            <li> is perfect for thick or coarse hair and the plates dont pull or cause damage.</li>
            <li> The green light just turns on, contact the seller for a replacement and since it has been more than 30days</li>
            <li> I have relatively straight her to begin with, so I&#x27;m able to keep the heat at a low temperature and still achieve straighter hair.  </li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up and leaves hair smooth and silky; however, the heat/ceramic plate isn&#x27;t as hot as the other Hai Classic</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> So maybe spending more money on a flat iron is a smart thing to do.</li>
            <li> so when I sweat or its hot outside, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizzier nearly as easy as it use to.</li>
            <li> This straightener works very well, heats up fast, and had many different heat settings.</li>
            <li> Just as hot and fast as the Croc.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything is good so far.</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a flat iron spray and so i get build up from that, which it wipes off very easily which is nice.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to find it online for about half the price.  </li>
            <li> She said the cheaper flat irons do get very hot, but do not give off the right kind of heat, which results in damage, and less than stellar results.  </li>
            <li> Huge quality difference compared to the cheap conair one I had previously.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and is very hot.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn, right?</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I did not purchase these flat ions from Amazon ($200 bucks 9 years ago), however, this is a great price for a pair of flat irons that will last you along time with proper care and reveal fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Hope I can always get this particular iron!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> This straightener does not straighten really curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys, but I was just under 50lbs.</li>
            <li> then the red light started flashing on and off and the plates kept turning off.  </li>
            <li> .. Makes the hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is also very well made.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product - my friend used it at my bachelorette party in Vegas</li>
            <li> the heating is fast and adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (hair keeps straight alllll day and night), doesn&#x27;t snag hair as much as the cheap-o brands.</li>
            <li> Has really burnt the</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of my Favorites</li>
            <li> It heats up fast every time and you can have the temprature up to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> and I can get my hair stick straight.  </li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to return so I will use it until it croaks.</li>
            <li> Much prefer Solia and Chi products to this.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this item.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the price this time .</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in hopes of having healthier hair (ironic, I know) and in the month</li>
            <li> You can really tell a difference between this straightener and the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> and they were very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and i will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as it has the type of electrical connection that makes it easy to connect to the same outlet as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I did extensive research to buy the best possible flat iron, because my daughter has kinky curly hair, and I wanted an iron that left hair straight and glossy without frying it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this flat iron works well for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this product; it glides through your hair and makes it behave.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightner I have ever bought, however, the product began to lose its heat after about 4 months, using it probably every to every other day.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this, for a girl that has been using this tool for the last 10 years, its worth it!</li>
            <li> I decided on this (it was given great reviews) rather than my favorite brand OnePass, and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found the Hai Classic and am very grateful that I found it.</li>
            <li> It was a good product at first, but after a while it made my hair worse.</li>
            <li> I bought the 2nd one 8/26/10 and used it just as much as my old one that I&#x27;d had for 4-5 years except this time around it worked great until the blue ceramic coating started wearing off of the plates earlier this summer (2012).</li>
            <li> ALSO MORE AFFORDABLE THAN OTHER BRANDS!</li>
            <li> Just needed a new one now!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this flat iron ten years ago at a local beauty supply store about 10 years ago for MUCH more.</li>
            <li> ... however, my previous model, and I don&#x27;t remember the model name, was straightening my hair better than this one.</li>
            <li> however i was able to get it here for half the price</li>
            <li> It left her hair looking like straw, and freezed up quickly.</li>
            <li> I may order again but most likely will purchase from a local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same as the first one I had</li>
            <li> thick hair love it worth the money</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and looks very well made, looks very professional too.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, mostly straight hair that usually responds well to straighteners.</li>
            <li> It gets nice and hot, which is great for my thick hair; very little time is spent straightening my hair!</li>
            <li> the first and only time I have used it,  it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The construction is also high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and bought one for my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than my last flat iron</li>
            <li> After using the HAI for about 10 years and being loyal, I am going to have to try another flat iron.</li>
            <li> I need a very hot, high powered flat iron which this is not.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft straight, but with volume.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the $65 price tag for a straightener that leaves hair straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this lovely hair tool will last me.</li>
            <li> I am African American and it not only makes my hair look nice, it helps keep mostiure in my hair</li>
            <li> I also got it for a cheaper price than it normally sells in salons.</li>
            <li> My hair is very course and this flat iron can get my hair very straight.</li>
            <li> I loved it, dropped it at least 10 times, to the point that even one of the plates popped out and it snapped back in and worked like a charm for a few more months.</li>
            <li> When putting iron away after its cool, loosely fold cord according to the curves already in the cord.</li>
            <li> While it is covered under the warranty, I have to pay to ship it and then have to pay HAI $14.95 to send me a new one.</li>
            <li> so here I am ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> Ordered the new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> and I will probably continue buying this straightener every time I need a new one.</li>
            <li> If I could afford a new one, I would replace this one in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> and she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> I looked on amazon for a new one but</li>
            <li> I went to a new salon about a year ago and got a hair cut.</li>
            <li> This new one Is made in China.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this item in January, have only had it for 4month and hardly used it brand new and in good condition and just stopped heating up.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and it&#x27;s simple design</li>
            <li> This new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a Chi and that works so much better.</li>
            <li> it doesnt get hot enough.</li>
            <li> this hot iron is for my wife she loves it and stays off my back</li>
            <li> It got really hot and then turned off and now it will not turn back on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that with my first one, and that&#x27;s why I had to buy a second.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands (chi, T3, hot tools, Paul Mitchell, etc)</li>
            <li> I broke my first one and bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more in the past .</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve owned it so far I have noticed a difference!  </li>
            <li> and so this gets plenty hot enough (and some) for me.</li>
            <li> I am able to strighten my hair with ease and you don&#x27;t have to constantly got over the same area to get it flat.</li>
            <li> They also could give me no extimate or timeline of a turnaround with the new or fixed straightener.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me 3 years and this second one 4 years so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that at first because the chi was a step up from my walmart flat iron(literally an iron!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my first Hai flat iron for 6 year before I dropped it on my ceramic floor and broke it.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightener, my hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> I find that my hair looks better the next day (less puffy).</li>
            <li> First, let me began to say that I have had these flat irons for ALMOST 10 YEARS now!</li>
            <li> This flat iron did not last as long as it should if it would have been an authentic Hai brand.</li>
            <li> I use this in my professional salon.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, and this straightener really only damaged my hair completey and caused it to frizz up after an hour.</li>
            <li> I received it for Christmas and on May 17th it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> but it was old.</li>
            <li> It still works but being so old it doesn&#x27;t turn on from time to time.</li>
            <li> If you move the cord around it works sometimes, but mine just now completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> They then told me to call HAI directly</li>
            <li> My hair has a natural stubborn wave that requires I iron it twice---sometimes three times in stubborn areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of Hair that is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> and it only takes about 20 minutes to get my hair stick and shiny straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the old one which was stolen.  </li>
            <li> Snags on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting straight style.</li>
            <li> but when I go out I like my hair to be extra straight and with this iron</li>
            <li> but actually this iron made her hair straight</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> Replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair like her old one did.</li>
            <li> Of course it was no longer under warranty so after much research I purchased a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium off Amazon last week.</li>
            <li> so I think this is old inventory as well.</li>
            <li> I am a male with 28 inches of real grown out hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would have kept my old one.</li>
            <li> It has blades with curved edges so you can put a soft curl at the end of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like my old one but isn&#x27;t made in Korea.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t order a replacement fast enough.</li>
            <li> My old one lasted over 4 years.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted---gentle to my hair---but takes the uneven curl out---and leaves my hair shinny and straight !</li>
            <li> This was the first flat iron I bought that worked on my extremely curly coarse red hair (imagine Macy Gray and Carrot Top having kids).  </li>
            <li> Loved my HAI until this happened and sorry - not going to risk it happening again</li>
            <li> so if you want the original product   make sure it has an \\&quot;R\\&quot; next to the logo and not a \\&quot;TM\\&quot;  Also guarantee is useless with the TM product.   </li>
            <li> My wife wanted a new flat iron and this came highly recommend from her hair stylist -</li>
            <li> i really didnt like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron makes my hair perfectly straight and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> and I have owned flat irons that cost 3 times as much</li>
            <li> I need something that can keep my hair from frizzing right back up after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I can straighten my hair in half the time is used to take me.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> Having chemically straightened my hair for years now, I would highly recommend using a serum, especially at your ends, to protect your hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Major difference!</li>
            <li> I asked why 9 dollars, and they said to pay for shipping for a fixed/and or new straightner back to me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I only rate it 4 stars because there are more expensive units that may be better in terms of less drying out of the hair.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little wider because my hair is long but the 1 1/4 width makes it more versatile.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot and cheaper here than other places.</li>
            <li> second flat iron of the exact same model</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t live without a Hai Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is left soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I owned this same straightener for about 2 years and used it every day before my old one died.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T leave the cord wrapped around the straightener, especially when you study abroad for a year and decide to go ~all natural~ for your time there.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how big the difference was.  </li>
            <li> This seemed ok when I received it however, the temperature gauge seems to be broken.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Hai Classic Convertible Ceramic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> My kids - especially my teenaged son who is a fanatic about his hair - love the Hair flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, Hai is better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my niece because i bought this exact same flat iron for my self back in 06</li>
            <li> I really should have listened to other reviews.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li> My old flat iron lasted ages and was sturdy as a rock.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and gets very big in humidity especially.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews from various websites and reviews on Amazon too, I decided to step up my game and pay a bit more for a Hai.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, fine hair which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to being straigtened.  </li>
            <li> As long as I also use Kerastase oleo relax slim, this flat iron does the job and keeps my hair straight all day long in the humid Georgia summers.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my old HAI flat iron which lasted me 4 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied since the item is almost new and hardly used it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my previous flat iron (exact same one) when it died on me after 7 years.</li>
            <li> They are very smooth and don&#x27;t catch the hair on any weird edges.</li>
            <li> Discount Jungle had fast shipping though the price of it could have been a little lower considering it was being shipped from within my same city!</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron i&#x27;ve used that does not dry out my hair or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Hai produces quality flat irons that make it such that it takes me no more than 15 minutes for my hair to be totally straight!</li>
            <li> The temperature settings go up high enough to tame my frizzy mess of waves into a sleek and straight style in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this same flat iron several years ago from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I use to pay almost $100 for this same flat iron at my local hair salon/supply</li>
            <li> I reported it to the manufacturer as my prior flat iron from a different brand lasted for 7+ years.  </li>
            <li> Over the last several years, I always stuck w/ a cheaper flat iron, prob in the $25-$35 price bracket.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron that I have ever owned.    </li>
            <li> I have now had this flat iron for a month and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> This has been my only flat iron for years.</li>
            <li> Replaced my flat iron the same type that lasted over 8 years!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this same flat iron for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Hai is the only brand of flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this same flat iron for 9 years!</li>
            <li> I had a CHI flat iron for 7 years and definitely regret purchasing this flat iron.</li>
            <li> ceramic plates do wonders for your hair - it keeps your hair soft, rather than damaging it like other flat irons</li>
            <li> I went from dry Curly hair (with a little Ion silk drops) to bone straight hair in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would have to twist the end of the straightener every which way to get the light to turn back on, and sometimes the flat iron would turn off midway through the straightening process, which was super annoying.  </li>
            <li> Not happy because now I will have to go and buy a new one from a beauty supply store and ensure its a real Hai product...</li>
            <li> Only problem with this brand is they do not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very old Solano Sapphire which worked very well but was outdated.  </li>
            <li> , usually irons don&#x27;t work much on her hair</li>
            <li> My hair glides through flat irons with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read through the reviews before I purchased this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It was a 1/4 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My HAI flat iron just died on me.</li>
            <li> would recommend a CROC flat iron over this one...</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after doing a ton of research</li>
            <li> Flat iron works well.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend users don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the flat iron when they&#x27;re done using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been sharing this flat iron for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I purchased my HAI flat iron through Vendor:  InVanity.  </li>
            <li> I am a GHD girl by nature, but I bought this flat iron based on price and a referral from one of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for years, after using cheaper drugstore (e.g., Conair) brands in my college days.  </li>
            <li> plus i got a deal on this flat  iron she paid 100+ on her flat iron</li>
            <li> For the price, this flat iron does the job.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Croc, but after 2 burnouts over the years I researched for another flat iron.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Hai flat iron.</li>
            <li> I know people who&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for YEARS</li>
            <li> flat irons,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Nothing does the join like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Rule #1 of Flat Iron Ownership - do NOT coil or wind the cord around ANY flat iron -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for about maybe 4 years now</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> New iron is a little defective as the 2 plates are not in alignment.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is a dream!</li>
            <li> Awsome flat iron!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> I kept it in a secure place, didn&#x27;t throw it around and this is unacceptable for such an expensive item.</li>
            <li> my hair always felt burnt and dry, even after using deep conditioners and heat protection sprays with the chi.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes to smooth my mixed-texture, average thickness, long hair and give it just a little bend at the end.</li>
            <li> While delivery was prompt and met Amazons usual high standards, the Flat Iron itself is defective and will not maintain temperature.  </li>
            <li> I always left the cord loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this regularly for 11 year and always have stored with the cord loose and never wrapped.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned this same brand flat iron for 8 years before finally the switch broke.</li>
            <li> AND it will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how long ago I purchased it</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even know how long I&#x27;ve had it for, seems like forever.  </li>
            <li> and I do not even have long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this when my hair was just a couple of inches long, as well as below shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this straightner really makes my hair sleek.</li>
            <li> i love this brand of flat irons but in the last few years they have been manufactured in china instead of Korea and the quality has really diminished, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I thought that 1 1/4 was a 1 and 1/4 inch wide flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I only straighten my hair one day a week and leave my hair curly the other 6 days, and my hair still gets fried.</li>
            <li> but this is my second Hai (I accidentally fried the other in Europe using what I thought was a working converter)</li>
            <li> and it does break off due to any short of heat</li>
            <li> I have tried other irons, but I keep going back to this one and always buy a spare just in case.</li>
            <li> flat iron was ok..did not perform how I expected..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guaranteed, anyone who rated this product low due to complaints about function &amp; product dying, didn&#x27;t apply said rule.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a totally different looking ceramic flat iron with black plates</li>
            <li> and it took a very long time to get an exchange for the correct one I wanted.</li>
            <li> My GF let me borrow this straightner and it works A-mazingly well on dry hair.</li>
            <li> (Keeping hair dry of course though).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for another HAI straightener, my last one died after 6 years of constant everyday use.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty tough to straighten.</li>
            <li> I bought this version of Hai for my wife thinking its better then the other less expensive one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After 7 months, the product became defective and the plates came loose.  </li>
            <li> The wire cord is somehow loose on the inside and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> so i recommend it if for nothing else to quiet down your wife</li>
            <li> Plus, back when I got one, it was very expensive, and now they are so cheap that it made me doubt the quality...</li>
            <li> This totally gets my hair straighter, smoother, and sleeker in half the time.  </li>
            <li> This one feels less solid.  </li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s was super expensive, so there was not way I could afford it.  </li>
            <li> After the last trip to the salon, the hair dresser used her very fancy, expensive flat iron on my hair...and what a difference!!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this expensive flat iron because it got such high ratings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one for MYSELF today; no more back &amp; forth between bathrooms, \\&quot;Who&#x27;s got the flat</li>
            <li> I have been using the iron for several months now and completely hate it, I am giving it 2 stars because it does iron OK, but it catches my hair EVERY SINGLE TIME I use it</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t the curliest but it is definitely curly and can be a little frizzy at times.</li>
            <li> I finally buckled in buying a little bit more expensive hair straightener because I have thick, course, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long straighteners usually last, but this straightener has worked well for me being that I use it every day.</li>
            <li> i wish it were a wide plate</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering.</li>
            <li> After using it everyday for years, it got a short in the cord</li>
            <li> Does not really work well with longer or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I only need to pass it over my dried hair twice</li>
            <li> **** out of my hair in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> i can say the the company is very helpful with replacing a broken product through their 1 year warrenty</li>
            <li> The hai makes my hair look shiny and thin and straight.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll come back to America with a dead straightener</li>
            <li> The only think I can complain about is that the transition between the blue plate and the black plastic sometimes catches my hair when I&#x27;m straightening my hair and takes a few strands with it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a little wider than I like-</li>
            <li> This one gears up fast and does not rip my hair like my other thin iron.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product since the reviews were so high, but ended up being very disappointed.</li>
            <li> She tells me her hair seem much less dry after using it (compared to the con-air one she had).</li>
            <li> She wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected!  </li>
            <li> I was kinda mad because I thought I had purchased the Original HAI.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say specifically what it didn&#x27;t do, other than it did not work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener died faster than any other straightener i&#x27;ve ever owned....</li>
            <li> It is the 1 1/4 iron not the 1/4 like the other reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It, along with all her other junk, takes up a lot of space on the countertop</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t get any other brand.</li>
            <li> and I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> Does not work like my other one</li>
            <li> In the past I could only get it straightened at the hair</li>
            <li> Also, the only negative reviews were that some long time users felt the product was not as heavy duty as it once was.</li>
            <li> It claims to be ceramic; but, I&#x27;ve had ceramic in the past and it has never left my hair so dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with turning the temp down a bit</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wave hair so with cheaper flat irons it can take hours to straighten.</li>
            <li> The ceramic coating on this iron started to wear off in less than 15 days.</li>
            <li> The previous iron bought was made in USA and had no problems.</li>
            <li> Works just like my previous one that I had for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I was very worried there was something wrong, but within a few weeks the smell went away.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the previous one I had for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> It took less effort and time.</li>
            <li> It took less than a 45 seconds to heat up to 400.</li>
            <li> I bought this becasue my previous hair straightener broke.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid at first it might be a knock-off, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed at the cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair</li>
            <li> It is still a time-consuming process if you have long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I put them away after purchasing them a few months ago and tried again last night-STILL NO good.</li>
            <li> If you just need a little bit of heat this would probably work for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it damages my hair compared to other straighteners I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I works really well on thick hair!!!  </li>
            <li> Other that that , my wirey, frizzy lid loves it!!</li>
            <li> First I bought a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, the ultra slim one, which was very expensive.</li>
            <li> It stopped working about few weeks ago, do note that I am now 22.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> At the 12 month point it would decide to turn on whenever it wanted to and now after 16 months its completely dead.  </li>
            <li> It was heavy for its size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday though.  </li>
            <li> And I used it almost everyday for those 6 years.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I found that they are heavy which i can deal with</li>
            <li> I switched to a Chi and it conked out after a few years.</li>
            <li> Dropped it a few times and the tile floor and never had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> and i strightnen my hair almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased almost 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This replaces my previous Hai Iron----an iron I purchased 13 years ago!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how absolutely terrible my cheap 20 dollar flat iron was until I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron to replace my girls broken one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord on this is really long, so it&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience to ensure we drape the cord to the left and tuck it behind our electric toothbrush base to keep it there while using it.</li>
            <li> I still got probably 5 years out of the first one before the cord went bad.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the flat iron stopped working after less than 12 months.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li> iron??!!\\&quot;  Someone (who shall remain nameless) did yank the cord from the very tight wall sockets we have and we now have to plug it in strategically - propping the cord angled to the left to get it to heat up, but that \\&quot;someone\\&quot; learned a lesson in propper unplugging.</li>
            <li> This past weekend, i wore it down w/ no issues!!</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Iron portion was too small.</li>
            <li> It said mini however was way too small.</li>
            <li> Does not love.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Whenever it would rain in the past, I would automatically just wear my hair up to not have to deal w/ my hair fighting the humidity.</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased it in the past from salon stores</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing considering I only used the flat iron a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I usually set it to 390 since my hair is hard to manage but it goes up to 400.  </li>
            <li> It finally gave out on me due to some bad wiring, so I decided to check to see if Amazon sold it.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to grab with the chubby design.</li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s hard to believe I have curly hair at all.  </li>
            <li> negative is that it took almost 2 wks to arrive ???</li>
            <li> Now its too late to get a refund</li>
            <li> I would guess that this could have something to do with the way I store the cord, but the product shouldn&#x27;t be made so shoddily that wrapping the cord up causes it to malfunction.  </li>
            <li> have thick, curly hair and this iron</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this straightener works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> There are no more frizzies!</li>
            <li> Overall this product left my hair looking awful.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t fry my hair as bad, but I only straighten it about once or twice a month</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after 2 years, the power mechanism completely failed and the wiring is loose on the inside.  </li>
            <li> Both were very disappointing, so I went back to the HAI.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair (course texture)</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick Hispanic hair</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> With this product I couldn&#x27;t even tuck my hair behind my ear without it leaving a wave.</li>
            <li> because when you do, it will slowly bend the contacts inside of the swivel cord making it useless as it gets old.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s my girls</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really ridiculous!</li>
            <li> My hair is so bad from the iron that I have to put my hair in a bun after using it to make it appear less frizzy.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> So sad (((</li>
            <li> they were unable to exchange.</li>
            <li> unless I wanted to look like a scary clown.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> highest heat setting on dial is 400, very thin model, comparable to np group straightner at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I like that the cord swivels so as I turn my hand it doesn&#x27;t get awkward.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> She loves it and doesn&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not TOO bad.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer said that had a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how atrocious the smell is -regardless</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It looks like an alligator&#x27;s mouth, which is also a painful place to put your hand</li>
            <li> I hate to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Flat iron is OK....after a while the metal plates get worn.</li>
            <li> i wish it were a wide plate BUT as with all the HAIs i&#x27;ve had; a great product!</li>
            <li> i have very coarse, curly hair. I need a very hot, high powered flat iron which this is not. I usually buy a Chi and that works so much better. If you just need a little bit of heat this would probably work for you.</li>
            <li> Works great, straightens my hair very fast, flat iron gets very hot very fast, it does not pull my hair.  This is a top quality flat iron.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product is great especially for the price! I have owned this exact iron twice in the past and always come back to it.You can good a good 3/4 yrs out of the iron, comparable to CHI or T3.The heat is perfect for thick or coarse hair and the plates dont pull or cause damage.If you want a warranty for the product do not buy it on amazon, all online purchases void the warranty.  Discount Jungle had fast shipping though the price of it could have been a little lower considering it was being shipped from within my same city!</li>
            <li> The ceramic coating on this iron started to wear off in less than 15 days. I am having to return it to One Stop for repairs. The previous iron bought was made in USA and had no problems. This one was made in China (?).</li>
            <li> My kids - especially my teenaged son who is a fanatic about his hair - love the Hair flat iron.  It heats up quickly, gets hotter than most other brands, and works great for them.  I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times - I like the way the plates feel.  A big recommendation from our household.</li>
            <li> Love! Doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.  My hair glides through flat irons with ease. My hair is left soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightner!!  It works amazing! This is the only straightner that does not make my hair smell like burn! I reccommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is to be a Christmas gift so has not been opened yet.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: This is the only flat iron that I have ever owned.    My hair looks SO good since I have been using this flat iron! It takes just a few minutes to smooth my mixed-texture, average thickness, long hair and give it just a little bend at the end. There are no more frizzies! The only reason that I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut-off. Other than that, I love this product; it glides through your hair and makes it behave.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Outstanding Delivery time!</li>
            <li> Works so much better than my last flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read through the reviews before I purchased this flat iron.  Unfortunately, the flat iron stopped working after less than 12 months.  I never wrapped the cord around it .. (I&#x27;d read in the reviews not to do this .. for whatever reason). However, it worked great while it lasted but I won&#x27;t purchase another. I&#x27;ll stick with the regular Chi which has never gone out and I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> i really didnt like this flat iron. it doesnt get hot enough. i had a rusk flat iron berfore and that 1 is way better!</li>
            <li> My hair is very course and this flat iron can get my hair very straight. Great for curling as well</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my old HAI flat iron which lasted me 4 1/2 years.  I bought the same exact model because I loved it so much.  It is so easy to use and very light weight.  I use it to straighten my ends and use it to curl my hair.  I LOVE THIS product.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well !!:(</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these flat irons! First, let me began to say that I have had these flat irons for ALMOST 10 YEARS now! They are super hot, but the ceramic heated plates has not damaged my hair. I also, like how the heated plates are 100% ceramic, hence, this a plus because ceramic coated plates tend to get scratches over time. The scratches expose metal (underneath the ceramic) which in turn create heat damage to the hair (ceramic is what actually protect the hair). Furthermore, I did not purchase these flat ions from Amazon ($200 bucks 9 years ago), however, this is a great price for a pair of flat irons that will last you along time with proper care and reveal fantastic results!</li>
            <li> This is not the product I thought it was. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The best flattening iron out there. Your hair will look silky and smooth upon hairstyling. Its a must get</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Be careful when ordering. I thought that 1 1/4 was a 1 and 1/4 inch wide flat iron.  It was a 1/4 inch flat iron.  I had to return it and it took a very long time to get an exchange for the correct one I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it. And i got it what I wanted it. On time 😁😀</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one that my wife has used for over 3 years. She wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected!  Great iron.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this flat iron.  I bought this same flat iron several years ago from my hairdresser.  After using it everyday for years, it got a short in the cord so I needed to replace it.  My hairdresser was selling them for $120.  It&#x27;s a fabulous flat iron at a great price.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I did extensive research to buy the best possible flat iron, because my daughter has kinky curly hair, and I wanted an iron that left hair straight and glossy without frying it. First I bought a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, the ultra slim one, which was very expensive. It left her hair looking like straw, and freezed up quickly. I did more research, and found the highly rated Jilbere Nano Ceramic one...I bought ot at Sally&#x27;s, well, it felt cheap, the plates didn&#x27;t come fully together, and I had to pass it like 6 times to get hair smooth. Returned that one, too. Finally, I decided on the Hai because I had had one years and years ago, and was extremely happy with it, but because of reviews from customers saying they weren&#x27;t built the same, and they were cheaper built now, I was hesitant to buy another one. Plus, back when I got one, it was very expensive, and now they are so cheap that it made me doubt the quality...WRONG! I just bought one of these and I am sooooo happy! This flat iron is a dream! It heats up quickly, and leaves my daughter &#x27;s kinky curly hair so smooth and shiny! It feels sturdy and looks very well made, looks very professional too.</li>
            <li> My first great flat iron was a HAI, but after it broke, I tried and CHI and one of those mall kiosk brands. Both were very disappointing, so I went back to the HAI. This is the only flat iron i&#x27;ve used that does not dry out my hair or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> this hot iron is for my wife she loves it and stays off my back so i recommend it if for nothing else to quiet down your wife</li>
            <li> Love this flat Iron. Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> works very well.  i like the adjustable temperature.  after having a CHI for four years, it works just as well.  it heats up very quickly which is handy on busy mornings</li>
            <li> I use this in my professional salon. I straightens even the thickest, curly hair but it is pretty hot to the touch after a bit.  Definently worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, and this straightener really only damaged my hair completey and caused it to frizz up after an hour. My hair is so bad from the iron that I have to put my hair in a bun after using it to make it appear less frizzy. It was a good product at first, but after a while it made my hair worse. Note: I only straighten my hair one day a week and leave my hair curly the other 6 days, and my hair still gets fried. This straighten does, however, work well for my best friend who happens to have wavy hair. I suppose what I am saying is that get 100% ceramic plates(this one is not 100% ceramic) if you have culy hair like mine, or invest in this one if your hair is just wavy. This straightener does not straighten really curly hair. Oh, and the blue ceramic coat scraps off after a month and causes the metal underneath to become exposed... which is probably why it kills my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  It gets so hot and works great on my very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightner I have ever bought, however, the product began to lose its heat after about 4 months, using it probably every to every other day.  I emailed Hai and heard nothing.  A week later, I called them, only to have them tell me that they never received my email.  I confirmed the email address, and they told me I must not have sent it because they would have received it.  I resent the original email to prove my point.  I told them my issue, they told me I would have to mail them the product, with a check for 9 dollars and the receipt.  I asked why 9 dollars, and they said to pay for shipping for a fixed/and or new straightner back to me.  I told them that I thought they should pay the shipping because it was within warranty,and I was going to have to ship it and pay for that to them and already paid shippping when I first purchased it.  They said that is policy.  Anyways good product but don&#x27;t expect any customer service from this company.  They also could give me no extimate or timeline of a turnaround with the new or fixed straightener.</li>
            <li> Works just like I thought it would.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Very affordable!</li>
            <li> This Hai flat iron was the best price on the web and shipping was fast as promised.  Because the price was so low I was afraid at first it might be a knock-off, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It works perfectly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Ok. It isn&#x27;t has hot as the one I had before. I&#x27;ve had this same exact product before and the iron was hotter therefore straightened better. I did wonder if it is defective. I may order again but most likely will purchase from a local beauty supply. I think retailers should inspect the products before selling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Not as great as the Solia.</li>
            <li> This is my third one, love it!!!</li>
            <li> My sister owned this straightener about 8 years ago.  I started using it, and I fell in love. She bought me one for my 18th birthday, and I used it A LOT. It stopped working about few weeks ago, do note that I am now 22. Basically, my straightener lasted for 4 years. I think that&#x27;s pretty good, especially because I used it so much. I am now re purchasing this straightener because it is good quality. It leaves my hair very shiny and smooth. I don&#x27;t feel like it damages my hair compared to other straighteners I used in the past. It straightens my hair quick and easy. I recommend this straightener to anybody. It works on any type of hair too. It&#x27;s an amazing product. I honestly can&#x27;t live without a Hai Flat Iron. If you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, consider on buying this one. Plus, it&#x27;s pretty affordable. You wont regret getting it! I hope they never stop making it because this is definitely my fave straightener of all times.</li>
            <li> Okay, these are the best. They are sturdy. I had my original one for 7 years in PERFECT CONDITION. Until I went on a trip. Baggage claim guys snapped it because I had a &amp;#34;Heavy&amp;#34; tag on my luggage. Thanks guys, but I was just under 50lbs. Still the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had! And you&#x27;ll love it too!  AND it will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was so excited for all the reviews,  but after checking the box and the product I saw a TM next to the HAI logo.  I was kinda mad because I thought I had purchased the Original HAI.  (I purchased it from amazon products)but the first and only time I have used it,  it worked better than expected. It was fast and easy to used   and my hair looked great. I would give it 4 stars,   if it wasnt for the TRADE MARK. so if you want the original product   make sure it has an \\&quot;R\\&quot; next to the logo and not a \\&quot;TM\\&quot;  Also guarantee is useless with the TM product.   Other than that everything is good so far.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have owned. My first one lasted almost 15 years!!! Highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My HAI flat iron just died on me. I received it for Christmas and on May 17th it completely stopped working. It got really hot and then turned off and now it will not turn back on. While it is covered under the warranty, I have to pay to ship it and then have to pay HAI $14.95 to send me a new one. I had a CHI flat iron for 7 years and definitely regret purchasing this flat iron. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron prior to buying this one on Amazon, and it worked great...but it was old. This new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one. I wonder if it might be defective? The iron is good, but the one shipped to me (in particular) isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Does not really work well with longer or curly hair.  Does not straighten hair at all. I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Had one previously and loved it.</li>
            <li> This powerful iron overheats easily and it&#x27;s able to melt some of its plastic parts.</li>
            <li> Very practical and works great!  I cannot remember how long ago I purchased it but it still works great!  I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times and it&#x27;s still intact and looks new; sort of.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s sturdy and awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My 1st one lasted 7 years. It still works.  It&#x27;s is great on all hair types.</li>
            <li> Awsome flat iron! I love it!</li>
            <li> Works just like my previous one that I had for over 5 years.  I did just get it a couple of weeks ago, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am on my third Hai Convertible Iron in 5 years, they do only last 1.5 years, but for the price, it is excellent.  It will just stop working, the lights will stop blinking after this 1.5 year.  Other than that, it is the best one out there, I have fluffy hair and it flattens it out, I get tons of compliments, takes only 5 minutes to make is silky smooth.  I am very much against the Chi I bought of Amazon, but I am in love with the Hai Convertible has been a hit with me.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Takes for EVER to heat up and doesn&#x27;t have the weight the CROC to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a CROC flat iron over this one...sorry</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after doing a ton of research and I don&#x27;t regret my decision one bit. It has worked wonderfully on my hair. I would recommend it to anyone that asked. And the price is great, also. My hair isn&#x27;t the curliest but it is definitely curly and can be a little frizzy at times. This flat iron makes my hair perfectly straight and not frizzy at all. I straighten my hair in the morning and this iron does it in no time. Again I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> received really quickly packaged well. Flat iron works well.  It heats up quickly. No damage to my hair.  I have some short hair int he back and it is hard to grab with the chubby design.</li>
            <li> Bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews.  Was pretty good for the first six months then the red light started flashing on and off and the plates kept turning off.  At the 12 month point it would decide to turn on whenever it wanted to and now after 16 months its completely dead.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> My favorite straightener. Love it!!</li>
            <li> love this flat iron..best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and I have owned flat irons that cost 3 times as much.. Makes the hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> I have now had this flat iron for a month and use it daily.  It is working GREAT, does not burn my hair and straightens in only one pass!  It also heats up very quickly.  I am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 5 years and never had a problem. It always heated right away and straightened my hair really well, including the shine it gave. I have really long, thick hair and it worked great. Anyways, it finally stopped working so here I am ordering a new one. I know there&#x27;s newer, wazoo straighteners out there, but for the price this straightener is a must have!! I also recommend users don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the flat iron when they&#x27;re done using it. I always left the cord loose. That could be people only have it last a year.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a new flat iron and this came highly recommend from her hair stylist - she uses it in her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!  She loves it and doesn&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about it.  This was a win.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, it works really well! It leaves hair soft straight, but with volume. If you need a straightener this is the one!</li>
            <li> This has been my only flat iron for years. I previously purchased almost 10 years ago! It still works but being so old it doesn&#x27;t turn on from time to time. Ordered the new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love HAI!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hai Classic Convertible Ceramic Flat Iron.  Heats up quickly, does a great job on my waist length hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and was very pleased at first. About a week after having the product it stopped getting as hot and stopped straightening my hair. Overall this product left my hair looking awful. I was very excited to get this product since the reviews were so high, but ended up being very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been sharing this flat iron for over a year now. I&#x27;m buying one for MYSELF today; no more back &amp; forth between bathrooms, \\&quot;Who&#x27;s got the flat iron??!!\\&quot;  Someone (who shall remain nameless) did yank the cord from the very tight wall sockets we have and we now have to plug it in strategically - propping the cord angled to the left to get it to heat up, but that \\&quot;someone\\&quot; learned a lesson in propper unplugging. Live and learn, right? The cord on this is really long, so it&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience to ensure we drape the cord to the left and tuck it behind our electric toothbrush base to keep it there while using it. Don&#x27;t yank by the cord! Grasp by the plug as it&#x27;s meant to be done!!  This Hai Convertable heats up super fast, and flattens with ease (section your thick hair of course), makes your hair shiny smooth - You&#x27;ll LOVE it!  Got to go order my second one now....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two of these straighteners already, and am now purchasing a third. This straightener works very well, heats up fast, and had many different heat settings. I have pretty thick hair and it usually only takes me about 30 minutes to straighten it with this straightener. The only problem is about every two years it breaks, and just starts shutting itself off. If you move the cord around it works sometimes, but mine just now completely stopped working. I&#x27;m not sure how long straighteners usually last, but this straightener has worked well for me being that I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Awesome flat iron, makes great curls as well if you know how to do it. I had one for 7 years and it worked great until it died on me so I recently purchased a replacement hope it lasts another 7 years.</li>
            <li> Too small. Iron portion was too small. It said mini however was way too small. It was heavy for its size. Returned iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Ceramic Flat Irons but this is the best. I have thick course hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very old Solano Sapphire which worked very well but was outdated.  It was bulky and had metal plates.  My sleek Hai came with a heat proof case which comes in very handy.  I have very thick wavy hair (course texture) and this iron does the trick. I only wish it was a little wider because my hair is long but the 1 1/4 width makes it more versatile.  I like that I can control the temperature too.  I usually set it to 390 since my hair is hard to manage but it goes up to 400.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and so far so good.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday though.  Maybe 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased my HAI flat iron through Vendor:  InVanity.  After 7 months, the product became defective and the plates came loose.  I contacted the vendor regarding a warranty and InVanity told me to basically screw off.  They were 100% unwilling to assist me with repairs or replacement.  They then told me to call HAI directly and when I did, HAI said they would not assist because InVanity was an unauthorized vendor.  I am 100% FURIOUS and DISSATISFIED with this vendor InVanity.  I hope they get exactly what they deserve.  NOTHING!</li>
            <li> I am a GHD girl by nature, but I bought this flat iron based on price and a referral from one of my friends. This flat iron is a little wider than I like- I prefer a 1inch for manipulation purposes.  I have now had this since January 2012 and waited to review it because I wanted to see what kind of longevity it has.  It&#x27;s still working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly hair and this iron definitely does the job. The only thing I do not like is that if you leave the room you are in and come back, it smells like you had a bonfire of hair in the room.  I cannot tell you how atrocious the smell is -regardless if I use product or not. If you can put up with that, then this iron is definitely worth the  money.</li>
            <li> The straightner is a good quality product that arrived in a timely fashion.  Please note that the manufacturer does not honor the warranty if purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> works great, my hair gets so hot i can&#x27;t touch it</li>
            <li> Replaced my flat iron the same type that lasted over 8 years!!! Does the job quickly without any problem. I received it quickly and in great condition. Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My hair is curly &amp; kinky &amp; it made it super silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron; the iron is a good value for the money. It heats up quickly and does not damage the hair. My hair has a natural stubborn wave that requires I iron it twice---sometimes three times in stubborn areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replaces my previous Hai Iron----an iron I purchased 13 years ago!  Hope it lasts as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of Hair that is naturally curly. My GF let me borrow this straightner and it works A-mazingly well on dry hair. I went from dry Curly hair (with a little Ion silk drops) to bone straight hair in about 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried Conair, Remington and Chi and this is the best, quickest hair straightner for ladies with natural curly hair who like straight hair on occation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener. I have bought this straightener twice. The first time I bought it was in 2005 for $125. When it finally stopped working earlier this year I searched for it on Amazon and found it for $65!! It works exactly the same as the first one I had and I will probably continue buying this straightener every time I need a new one. You can&#x27;t beat the $65 price tag for a straightener that leaves hair straight, shiny, and soft. Also, another great plus is that it takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my entire head of hair (mind you I have hair that falls between my shoulder blades and my waist). If you are in the market for a great straightener for a great price, this one certainly is worth considering.</li>
            <li> I started using this hair straightener for about 7 years. The first one lasted me 3 years and this second one 4 years so far. Amazingly, it&#x27;s still working just fine. This hair straightener heats up within 10 seconds, gives my hair the shiny look and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. My friends who borrowed mine, loved it all. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this lovely hair tool will last me.</li>
            <li> I just came on here to see how it was reviewed and decided to give my opinion.  I love mine!!!!!  It has lasted me many many years, I don&#x27;t even know how long I&#x27;ve had it for, seems like forever.  It still heats up instantly and is just like how it was in the beginning.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I bought a HAI straightener in 2005, and the plates were 100% ceramic. I bought this straightener because I needed a smaller one, and the ceramic coating chipped off and exposed metal plates, which burned my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. My first one lasted me 6 years.  It leaves your hair super straight and shiny. I bought one for my mom and sister too.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It gets hot really quick and makes my hair nice and shiny! The price for this product was a a bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for years, after using cheaper drugstore (e.g., Conair) brands in my college days.  This totally gets my hair straighter, smoother, and sleeker in half the time.  Having chemically straightened my hair for years now, I would highly recommend using a serum, especially at your ends, to protect your hair.  This product is also very well made.  I had my first one for about 6 years before I blew the fuse on it when I was traveling in NZ and forgot to use a converter.  And I used it almost everyday for those 6 years.  I bought two replacement ones.  That&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - my friend used it at my bachelorette party in Vegas (you know, when it&#x27;s SUPER important to look cute!) I had never straightened my hair before, but this makes it really smooth, sleek and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use - I&#x27;ve been experimenting with turning the temp down a bit so I don&#x27;t fry my hair as bad, but I only straighten it about once or twice a month so it&#x27;s not TOO bad.  I like that the cord swivels so as I turn my hand it doesn&#x27;t get awkward.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality flat iron and I really like it! It heats up fast and leaves my hair very smooth and soft. I have fine hair and this flat iron works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  At first it let off a burning smell and I was very worried there was something wrong, but within a few weeks the smell went away.  It&#x27;s possible there are better ones out there but this is my second Hai (I accidentally fried the other in Europe using what I thought was a working converter) and I think it is great!.  I only need to pass it over my dried hair twice and my hair looks great!  It also arrived quickly and the price was right!</li>
            <li> I decided on this (it was given great reviews) rather than my favorite brand OnePass, and was disappointed. This did not compare in anyway. It was more time consuming and didn&#x27;t perform. . I can&#x27;t say specifically what it didn&#x27;t do, other than it did not work well on my hair. I returned this and bought my OnePass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I love this flatiron because it is spring loaded as to help with the ease is use. It gets really hot for a smooth finish. And with he ceramic plates it&#x27;s heat is controled and with stay at the temperature you set it at. Expert advice...don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week. Your hair will stay straight for a few days and will not need to be touched up.</li>
            <li> I have used Hai for years and it is good quality and compares to the mos pricey of flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;great size and fits well in hands. the heating is fast and adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it always.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my previous flat iron (exact same one) when it died on me after 7 years. Great product, received it quickly and it perfect condition from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I havent tried it yet my friend had one and she said it was better than the chi flat iron so i was glad i got this flat iron and plus i got a deal on this flat  iron she paid 100+ on her flat iron i paid only 50!</li>
            <li> I had a T3 that finally died after a several years.  this is way more affordable and works better!</li>
            <li> My husband recommended this one.  He did research online and I am so glad he bought this for me. I love it.</li>
            <li> I had always used cheap straighteners from Target, etc, but they wouldn&#x27;t quite straighten out all my hair (fine, color-treated, abused hair) and keep it that way all day. After reading reviews from various websites and reviews on Amazon too, I decided to step up my game and pay a bit more for a Hai. And I will never go back! Quick heat up, straightens FOR GOOD (hair keeps straight alllll day and night), doesn&#x27;t snag hair as much as the cheap-o brands. Definitely give it a try; I LOVE mine.</li>
            <li> WISE UP AND CHECK YOUR ORDERS. I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM NOR DID I GET IT. GO BACK TO SLEEP.STUPID</li>
            <li> I have been using the iron for several months now and completely hate it, I am giving it 2 stars because it does iron OK, but it catches my hair EVERY SINGLE TIME I use it and I do not even have long hair. If I could afford a new one, I would replace this one in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> For the price, this flat iron does the job.  I have long, thick, fine hair which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to being straigtened.  As long as I also use Kerastase oleo relax slim, this flat iron does the job and keeps my hair straight all day long in the humid Georgia summers.</li>
            <li> Has really burnt the **** out of my hair in the last few weeks. I really should have listened to other reviews. Have been straightening my hair since 9th grade Im 23 now and it does break off due to any short of heat but this is different! my hair is almost 2 inches shorter since using this!!! YES I use protect-ant always have....get something better....</li>
            <li> This straightener died faster than any other straightener i&#x27;ve ever owned....and I straighten my hair only about 2x/month.  That&#x27;s really ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. I have two others that no longer get use. This one gears up fast and does not rip my hair like my other thin iron. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite flat iron.  I used it when I was a hair stylist on all my clients, and they always wanted to know what it was.  It gets hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.  The heat seating is adjustable also, which is a must.  The only thing about this, is you can&#x27;t wrap the cord around it when you put it away, it damages the cord.  I didn&#x27;t realize that with my first one, and that&#x27;s why I had to buy a second.  I still got probably 5 years out of the first one before the cord went bad.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands (chi, T3, hot tools, Paul Mitchell, etc) and I always go back to this one.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I keep on buying the Hai Classis. My 3rd one in 10 years.</li>
            <li> i love this brand of flat irons but in the last few years they have been manufactured in china instead of Korea and the quality has really diminished, very disappointing. but this is still a good product and even  though it breaks often. i can say the the company is very helpful with replacing a broken product through their 1 year warrenty</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted---gentle to my hair---but takes the uneven curl out---and leaves my hair shinny and straight !&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that it took almost 2 wks to arrive ???</li>
            <li> ...for my daughter and she loves it!  The first one lasted 6-7 years but eventually the ceramic wore out and she needed a new one.  She asked to have this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this same flat iron for over 10 years. I have very thick wavy hair and it only takes about 20 minutes to get my hair stick and shiny straight. I have tried other irons, but I keep going back to this one and always buy a spare just in case. I ordered this on Thursday morning from Amazon and by Friday afternoon DiscountsJungle had already delivered the package. It is the 1 1/4 iron not the 1/4 like the other reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> Service and delivery were awsome i had no problems with my product or the service thank you.</li>
            <li> I owned this style before.  I bought this one to replace the old one which was stolen.  It&#x27;s very good quality and affordable price.  The shipping was very much faster than expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and I love it! I know people always think CHI when discussing hair products but I love love love HAI. I have used them for over 15 years and it would take quite a lot to make me switch to anything else!</li>
            <li> Replacement for same iron. Our broke after 10 years.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron .. Absolutely one of my Favorites</li>
            <li> I do not actually use this but my wife does. She tells me she loves it, I bought her a $150 Chi straightener for a present a couple years ago and it actually fell apart in her hand one day so she replaced it with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t pull or catch her hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Her hair looks great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It, along with all her other junk, takes up a lot of space on the countertop&lt;br /&gt;-It gets really hot and I get scared to be around it&lt;br /&gt;-It looks like an alligator&#x27;s mouth, which is also a painful place to put your hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought about 4 of them since I started straightening my hair. wouldn&#x27;t get any other brand. simply the best.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightener, my hair is really thick. The hai makes my hair look shiny and thin and straight.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of weeks it doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and registered it with HAI for the warranty. I received an email asking me for the seller, I informed the and was informed that Premier beauty was not an authorized vendor and the warranty needed to be handled through Premier Beauty because HAI would not honor it!</li>
            <li> Flat iron came in perfect timing and works perfectly fine. Packaging was great for protecting the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good flat iron. Comparable to Chi but without the price tag!</li>
            <li> I owned this same straightener for about 2 years and used it every day before my old one died.  I purchased this one as a replacement.  Love the straightener because it gets hot extremely quickly (in less than a minute at the highest setting)and works great.  When I purchased this straightener, it was shipped and sold through amazon.com.  The description says that there is a \\&quot;thermal bag\\&quot; included and there is a picture.  The product I received was only the straightener and NO THERMAL BAG so keep that in mind before buying.  Since mine did not come as described the best I could give it was 4 stars.</li>
            <li> As described and came right as scheduled</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It gets rid of frizziness and leaves hair shiny.  It&#x27;s great for both straightening hair and make beachy waves.</li>
            <li> Does the job with no problem at the right price. Heats up fast and cools down fast. I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this flat iron. My last one I had for about 3 years and it finally gave out one day. I have never had any problems with it. It heats up fast every time and you can have the temprature up to 400 degrees. I am able to strighten my hair with ease and you don&#x27;t have to constantly got over the same area to get it flat. One or two strokes and you are good to go. I usually use a flat iron spray and so i get build up from that, which it wipes off very easily which is nice. The ceramic plates work awesome and I use this every other day. It&#x27;s a reliable flat iron for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron after doing a lot of research.  I found that they are heavy which i can deal with but the BIGGEST problem is that they pull and snag your hair.  I tried using smaller sections of course which takes forever and mine and my daughters hair still got caught somehow. I put them away after purchasing them a few months ago and tried again last night-STILL NO good. Now its too late to get a refund so I will try to sell them at work or something!   PS. the actual straightening part is ok its the snagging and pulling I cant deal with.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much that I got 2!  I works really well on thick hair!!!  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have had my HAI flag iron for four or five years, and it is still working! Great flat iron with adjustable heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this version of Hai for my wife thinking its better then the other less expensive one on Amazon. Wrong.  She likes it. Does not love.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Croc, but after 2 burnouts over the years I researched for another flat iron. I found the Hai Classic and am very grateful that I found it. So far so good. Just as hot and fast as the Croc.</li>
            <li> I truly believe it is a knockoff. It claims to be ceramic; but, I&#x27;ve had ceramic in the past and it has never left my hair so dry and dull. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Everything went great with the seller. This review is for the Hai flat iron. These always break on me after about 12-14 months, never fails. The connector stop working, where the light flickers and I have to position the cord just right for it to stay on. After using the HAI for about 10 years and being loyal, I am going to have to try another flat iron. I think for the money it should last longer than a year. WHEN it works, it works great. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener over 7 years ago and it had been working perfectly fine over all that time. Recently I traveled to Asia and forgot to use a power converter when I plugged this in and blew a fuse. *Note: it is NOT dual voltage! I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset that I broke such a reliable product, but happy to see that it was still being sold on Amazon! Replacing it was a no brainer. The updated model is even better, with a rounded edge so I can curl and flip my hair was well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still just as good as my old one: heats up very quickly, has variable heat settings, swivel cord to prevent tangles, and straightens my hair without any tugging or frizz. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Not as use to be. Very poor quality. Stoped working after 3m. So sad (((</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my niece because i bought this exact same flat iron for my self back in 06 and i still have it today. It is still workinf like a champ. I have very thick Hispanic hair and I can get my hair stick straight.  It heats up quickly, too.</li>
            <li> This seemed ok when I received it however, the temperature gauge seems to be broken.  Too much of a hassle to return so I will use it until it croaks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron at a mall kiosk 11 years ago on a whim. This week, it finally gave out on me and I had to throw it away. I looked on amazon for a new one but an concerned about some of the reviews claiming this model is a knock off. This is a shame because I think more than a decade of regular use is a great deal. I was hoping to replace it with an identical one...</li>
            <li> I have owned this iron for years! And have purchased them for all of my friends and family. It gets really hot quickly and does not damage your hair!</li>
            <li> The best straightener ever. Arrived quickly and well-packaged. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this actually because I DID break my last one. DON&#x27;T leave the cord wrapped around the straightener, especially when you study abroad for a year and decide to go ~all natural~ for your time there. You&#x27;ll come back to America with a dead straightener and you&#x27;ll be sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral: buy this, treat it right.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned. Heats quickly and sickens African-American hair. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner. It heats up fast &amp; leaves my hair looking smooth.</li>
            <li> Snags on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting straight style. I have very fine, mostly straight hair that usually responds well to straighteners. With this product I couldn&#x27;t even tuck my hair behind my ear without it leaving a wave. And humidity? Forget about it. Pretty disappointed. Much prefer Solia and Chi products to this. They give a longer lasting, softer finish on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Hai since before I can remember and I will never change. I switched to a Chi and it conked out after a few years. This item lasts FOREVER. It is perfect because it heats up quick and cools down quick. Adjustable heat is key if you have thinner or silkier hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic plates do wonders for your hair - it keeps your hair soft, rather than damaging it like other flat irons can do. I cannot stress enough how perfect this flat iron is!</li>
            <li> Does not heat well. Returned.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this Christmas gift. Gets hot and cheaper here than other places.</li>
            <li> I use to pay almost $100 for this same flat iron at my local hair salon/supply so I was thrilled to find it online for about half the price.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love love love this straightener!  It takes a beating and keeps working every time.  Dropped it a few times and the tile floor and never had a problem with it.  I bought one for my daughter as well.  Great buy and works great!</li>
            <li> I had one for 2 years works perfect thick hair love it worth the money first one just broke after 2 years&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found it here more cheap then beauty salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightening iron for about 5+ years now. It still works great! It gets really hot and I love that it has a dial to change the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;To help keep the iron in good conditions, I do not wrap the cord around the iron to store it. If you wrap the cord around the iron, it could kink the cord and wires inside and cause it to stop working.</li>
            <li> I always thought that the only way to keep my hair from getting frizzy from humidity when it was straight was but making sure it was hydrated and super healthy (which never happens). This is an AMAZING flat iron. I am African American and it not only makes my hair look nice, it helps keep mostiure in my hair so when I sweat or its hot outside, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizzier nearly as easy as it use to.</li>
            <li> It does the job but there are better flat irons out there. I do like that it has a temp setting though.</li>
            <li> This is honestly a great iron , I have wavy hair but when I go out I like my hair to be extra straight and with this iron it&#x27;s perfect ! My sister used it as well and she has curly hair , usually irons don&#x27;t work much on her hair but actually this iron made her hair straight doesn&#x27;t even seem like she has curly hair at all ! I&#x27;m happy I spent my money wisely (:</li>
            <li> This thing is a work horse. Very reliable! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, delivered as stated!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this flat iron. It works beautifully and it heats up quickly. The adjustable temperature is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the previous one I had for almost 10 years. I stepped on the old one and broke the plastic, otherwise it still worked perfectly. I have thick curly hair and this straightener works like a charm. When I lived in a sorority house everyone always asked to borrow it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very happy with results. No regret&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved product on time and i felt my need is met. Would like to order more Hai products. Makes a  big diffrence in the way I style my clients hair with soft,bouncy,&lt;br /&gt;silky healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item in January, have only had it for 4month and hardly used it brand new and in good condition and just stopped heating up. The green light just turns on, contact the seller for a replacement and since it has been more than 30days they were unable to exchange. Very dissatisfied since the item is almost new and hardly used it. Waist of money!</li>
            <li> heats up fast, no frizz, leaves a shiny smooth look. also can curl the hair nicely. the perfect buy! highest heat setting on dial is 400, very thin model, comparable to np group straightner at a cheaper price. great deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive flat iron because it got such high ratings.  Unfortunately after 2 years, the power mechanism completely failed and the wiring is loose on the inside.  It won&#x27;t turn on at all. I reported it to the manufacturer as my prior flat iron from a different brand lasted for 7+ years.  They said they only offer a 1 year warranty.  They did not offer any type of repairs or service.  This is very disappointing considering I only used the flat iron a few times a week.  The wire cord is somehow loose on the inside and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I kept it in a secure place, didn&#x27;t throw it around and this is unacceptable for such an expensive item.</li>
            <li> I finally buckled in buying a little bit more expensive hair straightener because I have thick, course, unmanageable hair. The straightener heats up quickly and does what you want it to with ease. Curling is a breeze as well. Throw away those cheap Conair brands you have and put this on your shopping list.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this item. It heats very quickly, feels solid, and works great. The light to indicate when it&#x27;s heated is very helpful.  Nice quality product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I have used this straightener for years. It&#x27;s reliable, heats up quickly, and makes your hair smooth and soft. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate to do my hair. I do not like fussing with weird gadgets and if it takes more than 10 minutes for me to do my hair, I will never do it. A friend of mine told me to invest in this flat iron and I am so happy that I did. The temperature settings go up high enough to tame my frizzy mess of waves into a sleek and straight style in no time at all. It heats up very fast and it&#x27;s simple design keeps it very easy to use. The construction is also high quality. I know people who&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for YEARS and it is always the first tool they go to. Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron to replace my girls broken one.&lt;br /&gt;It works the best as it heats up the hottest!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this design is the swivel power cord, it will stop working over time.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Don&#x27;t wind up the cord around itself! because when you do, it will slowly bend the contacts inside of the swivel cord making it useless as it gets old.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s my girls second flat iron of the exact same model so it&#x27;s got to be that good for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I should know because she rewarded me for getting her the same one!.... :)</li>
            <li> flat iron was ok..did not perform how I expected..</li>
            <li> Been using this HAI straightener for almost 15 years!  Have bought several over the years.... I straighten my hair often so they get lots of use and usually last me about 5 or so years.  Great straightener, great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent, Excellent straightener. Ive used many and so far this is my favorite. I broke my first one and bought a second one. I also purchased one for my daughter. It used to take me an hour or more to straighten my hair before i found this one. Now it only takes me 20 minutes and my hair stays straightened all day, with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Over the last several years, I always stuck w/ a cheaper flat iron, prob in the $25-$35 price bracket. I constantly would try different hair products, thinking that was the issue. My hair is naturally curly, and gets very big in humidity especially.  After the last trip to the salon, the hair dresser used her very fancy, expensive flat iron on my hair...and what a difference!!!!  Her&#x27;s was super expensive, so there was not way I could afford it.  But she did say that investing in a good flat iron was worth it. She said the cheaper flat irons do get very hot, but do not give off the right kind of heat, which results in damage, and less than stellar results.  So w/ that said, the hunt was on to find a reasonably priced iron, w/ good reviews.  After reading the reviews of this one, it seemed that overall everyone was happy. Also, the only negative reviews were that some long time users felt the product was not as heavy duty as it once was. Still, the results seemed to be ok.  I looked up various lists on line for &amp;#34;best flat irons,&amp;#34; and this one made a couple lists. So after reading the reviews, and seeing the sale price, i went for it. I must say that i absolutely love it!!!  Whenever it would rain in the past, I would automatically just wear my hair up to not have to deal w/ my hair fighting the humidity. This past weekend, i wore it down w/ no issues!! lol (Keeping hair dry of course though).  I highly recommend and very pleased w/ this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoys this iron. It does a great job straightening her hair, and it is one of the better units that don&#x27;t damage her hair as much as the cheaper none ceramic types. I only rate it 4 stars because there are more expensive units that may be better in terms of less drying out of the hair. Over all, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this product once every 5-6 Years. I Love this Hai Ceramic Flat iron. I have bought the same one for just about 12 years now. After I fell in love with it the first time I used it I knew I could not use anything else. Nothing does the join like this flat iron. Heats up Fast!. easy to use. Temp adjustable. Light starts flashing when it is heated to the temp you set it for. All my friends love using it when I have it around. Not heavy. travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Love this flat iron and was glad to find it. Shipping was super fast and it was packaged well too.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I saw someone on YouTube use this and it worked way better on their hair than mine. I need something that can keep my hair from frizzing right back up after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Hai is the only brand of flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. This is my third one and the only one I&#x27;ve had a problem with. It does an excellent job straightening my very curly hair but it pulls out strands of hair because they get caught in the ceramic plates. The price is very reasonable for the way it performs - if it didn&#x27;t pull out my hair I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this Hai straightener to replace my last Hai straightener that died after TEN years.  I had a gold one I bought at a beauty supply store years ago - this is no comparison.  The Hai straightener heats up fast and is so easy to use and it just feels good.  The gold one felt cheap.  That is all.</li>
            <li> I went to a new salon about a year ago and got a hair cut. As I was sitting in the chair as the stylist cut and straightened my hair(i have curly hair), i wanted to know what straighter she was using because my hair was like SILK! she told me it was the HAI. Never heard of it before. I was in love, but i wasn&#x27;t just going to go buy another flat iron just because i liked it more than my chi and I&#x27;m a college student so that wouldn&#x27;t be very cheap. Well, eventually, my chi finally stopped working after 3 years and I decided to get the hai instead of a new chi because its soooo much better!! my hair always felt burnt and dry, even after using deep conditioners and heat protection sprays with the chi. I didn&#x27;t notice that at first because the chi was a step up from my walmart flat iron(literally an iron!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I bought it, its worth the money, better than the CHI and I LOVE IT! most importantly, I LOVE my hair :)</li>
            <li> ... however, my previous model, and I don&#x27;t remember the model name, was straightening my hair better than this one. It took less effort and time. Nevertheless, Hai is better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more in the past . I really appreciate the price this time . Will definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this regularly for 11 year and always have stored with the cord loose and never wrapped. A friend of mine had this same flat iron for 9 years! I swear by this product. Highly recommend and bought one for my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever used</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever used, super powerful and does not feel like it&#x27;s ruining my hair.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this item. She will enjoy it very much thank you so much Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have had yet, and believe me I am a girl with weird kinks and curls in her hair. For the price you pay, its so worth it. Heats up super fast, works perfectly, has the heat control which is key!! I recommend this, for a girl that has been using this tool for the last 10 years, its worth it!</li>
            <li> THIS HEATS UP FAST, LEAVES HAIR SOFT, AND IT AN AWESOME STRAIGHTENER. IT IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ALSO MORE AFFORDABLE THAN OTHER BRANDS!</li>
            <li> omg I love it !!! it gives great heat and makes my hair more smooth.  I bought solia and they were good but it broke every year for no reason so i tried this product and my sisters and i approve :) highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Replacement for my old one. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Heats up in seconds. Perfect size for shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty tough to straighten. I have thick curly/wave hair so with cheaper flat irons it can take hours to straighten. Hai produces quality flat irons that make it such that it takes me no more than 15 minutes for my hair to be totally straight!</li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves my hair so smooth! It gets nice and hot, which is great for my thick hair; very little time is spent straightening my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she LOVES IT!!!!  It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair like her old one did.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product I&#x27;m happy with it so far! It hears up quickly and evenly and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best straigtener on the market. My daughter dropped the one I had previiously and broke it and I ordered this one the same day. It is a necessity.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  It started off as a winner--better and cheaper than the CHI--but after having it for about a year, the light started going on the fritz.  I would have to twist the end of the straightener every which way to get the light to turn back on, and sometimes the flat iron would turn off midway through the straightening process, which was super annoying.  I would guess that this could have something to do with the way I store the cord, but the product shouldn&#x27;t be made so shoddily that wrapping the cord up causes it to malfunction.  Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this flat iron ten years ago at a local beauty supply store about 10 years ago for MUCH more. It finally gave out on me due to some bad wiring, so I decided to check to see if Amazon sold it. I was overjoyed to see it available for much cheaper and it works wonderfully, just like my first one. Huge fan of this brand and the size is perfect for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> best hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Does not work like my other one did I had it streightens my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> After seeing my wife go through cheap flat-iron after cheap flat-iron, I ordered this for her.  She is in love with it! It heats up quick and is easy on her hair. She tells me her hair seem much less dry after using it (compared to the con-air one she had). It has been working well for the 6-months we have had it (used daily).</li>
            <li> I really like this product hope it does last a good time and wood buy once more if neded 2</li>
            <li> Works great! Bought this as recommended by my stylist to replace my CHI. I liked so much I bought another for traveling. Highly recommend this product as it has the type of electrical connection that makes it easy to connect to the same outlet as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great price, this is my replacement since I left my original in a hotel while on vacation. So glad not to have paid full price again!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for another HAI straightener, my last one died after 6 years of constant everyday use. I even bought a Chi but returned it because I liked this one better. So excited to get another HAI! I&#x27;ll never use another brand.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and dies it fast! Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my babybliss, I also bought a Solia and I must say I love it way more than babybliss but I think I prefer the Solia more than the Hai. Still a great flat iron and I love it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Love my hai straightner. The only straightner I have been using for years. I have thick curly hair and this straightner really makes my hair sleek.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!! Heats up fast and lasts forever!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive flat irons. This one is the absolute best!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved these flat irons. I bought this one to replace my last one that I had for over five years and i strightnen my hair almost everyday. I dont know if they are the best but they have been my favorite out of all I have tryed. They are very smooth and don&#x27;t catch the hair on any weird edges. If you aren&#x27;t picky (like a hair dresser or something) this is a great straighter.</li>
            <li> This is works so well! I love how it straightens and curls!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing. &amp;#60;3 try it you guys will love it</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in hopes of having healthier hair (ironic, I know) and in the month that I&#x27;ve owned it so far I have noticed a difference!  My hair is smoother and shinier.  I have relatively straight her to begin with, so I&#x27;m able to keep the heat at a low temperature and still achieve straighter hair.  This straightener has exceeded the expectations I&#x27;d had of it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. I have fine hair and so this gets plenty hot enough (and some) for me. Huge quality difference compared to the cheap conair one I had previously. So, no complaints from me.:)</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying the Hai straightener.  It works well.  My first one lasted probably about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I had this same HAI Classic for a good 4-5 years and it was awesome. I had purchased it at a salon for around $130 back in 2005/2006-ish. I loved it, dropped it at least 10 times, to the point that even one of the plates popped out and it snapped back in and worked like a charm for a few more months. When it finally died, I bought it again but this time off of Amazon and through discountsjungle. I believe it was still the authentic HAI, it looked identical to my old one but something changed in their manufacturing. I bought the 2nd one 8/26/10 and used it just as much as my old one that I&#x27;d had for 4-5 years except this time around it worked great until the blue ceramic coating started wearing off of the plates earlier this summer (2012). The ceramic never wore off my first HAI. Of course it was no longer under warranty so after much research I purchased a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium off Amazon last week. It&#x27;s fantastic and my hair is thanking me for it! If you see the blue ceramic wearing off your plates and it is during the warranty period, be sure to contact HAI for a replacement as the metal under the coating will fry your hair. Loved my HAI until this happened and sorry - not going to risk it happening again so I went with a product that carries a 4 year warranty. I&#x27;m not even certain that HAI would honor the warranty on this sold through discountjungle, ask them directly to be sure. They don&#x27;t even list the HAI converible on their website anymore, it&#x27;s a totally different looking ceramic flat iron with black plates so I think this is old inventory as well.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and is very hot.  It sustains heat well, and it fits easily into my hand.</li>
            <li> You can really tell a difference between this straightener and the cheaper brands. It heats up quickly and I can straighten my hair in half the time is used to take me.</li>
            <li> Rule #1 of Flat Iron Ownership - do NOT coil or wind the cord around ANY flat iron - ever.&lt;br /&gt;Guaranteed, anyone who rated this product low due to complaints about function &amp; product dying, didn&#x27;t apply said rule. Failing to do so messes with the wiring. When putting iron away after its cool, loosely fold cord according to the curves already in the cord. Let it flatten out over time, don&#x27;t try to force flatten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my HAI for 5 (FIVE) + years - lived by Rule #1 and have had ZERO problems, still works as good today as it did when first purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for about maybe 4 years now and I&#x27;m still pleased. I am a male with 28 inches of real grown out hair.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned this same brand flat iron for 8 years before finally the switch broke. Otherwise I would have kept my old one. I think this new one doesn&#x27;t get the hair as smooth nor does it have a good weight in my hand like the old one. Im a bit dissatisfied with how cheap it feels.</li>
            <li> This unit heated quickly, was easy to use.  My hair is too short for the size I purchased and was returned without any problems.  Good customer service from this company.  I would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> The perfect straightener!! The only think I can complain about is that the transition between the blue plate and the black plastic sometimes catches my hair when I&#x27;m straightening my hair and takes a few strands with it!</li>
            <li> Just like the one i bought 7 years ago! Works great. Some one mentioned the manufacture made a difference but both of mines are from China and work fine</li>
            <li> This was the first flat iron I bought that worked on my extremely curly coarse red hair (imagine Macy Gray and Carrot Top having kids).  I bought this iron in 2002 and it is just now starting to wear out...12 years later!!  When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s hard to believe I have curly hair at all.  I&#x27;ve used this when my hair was just a couple of inches long, as well as below shoulder length.  It has never pulled my hair.  It has blades with curved edges so you can put a soft curl at the end of your hair.  The only problem I&#x27;m starting to have now is that the cord I think is shorting out, either from storing it wrapped around the iron or from the swiveled end.  I always use it at 400 degrees and it has never burned my hair.  So happy to see it is still available, as I will buy it again anyway over a CHI or other brand name.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. Was actually recommended by my hair cutter.  Best one ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this straighter for my wife 2 years ago. Last summer the plates started chipping and turning white. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. The manufacturer said that had a bad batch. That don&#x27;t make these like they used to. They&#x27;re trying to save money and rip us off.....skip this straightener</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how absolutely terrible my cheap 20 dollar flat iron was until I bought this.  Major difference! This made my hair a lot smoother, heated a lot more quickly, and straightened my hair faster.  I was actually surprised how big the difference was.  So maybe spending more money on a flat iron is a smart thing to do.</li>
            <li> This flat iron did not last as long as it should if it would have been an authentic Hai brand. Its not even a year n the plates are yellow n sometimes it doesn&#x27;t reach the heat temperature I set it at.  Not happy because now I will have to go and buy a new one from a beauty supply store and ensure its a real Hai product...</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron in the mail. I just tried it and it made my hair shiny,soft,and fizz free. I love the fast heat up. It took less than a 45 seconds to heat up to 400. It is the best flat iron i have ever had in my life. I am now hooked on hai.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier... heats QUICKLY, straightens and curls very easily, leaves hair with a nice shine - im constantly getting compliments asking what products/etc i use. CAN&amp;#34;T say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up and leaves hair smooth and silky; however, the heat/ceramic plate isn&#x27;t as hot as the other Hai Classic I bought for $200 from a private hair salon.  It&#x27;s not as good as the first but for the affordable price it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like my old one but isn&#x27;t made in Korea.  This new one Is made in China.  My old flat iron lasted 10 years.  New iron is a little defective as the 2 plates are not in alignment.  It does the job for now.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would give it 1 more star is an auto shut off.. Other that that , my wirey, frizzy lid loves it!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was described!  My favorite brand of flat irons!</li>
            <li> Had this iron for ten years. Just needed a new one now! Hope I can always get this particular iron!</li>
            <li> Great price and product!!</li>
            <li> Great accurate iron. I verified the temps on the dial with an IR thermometer and they were very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these for a friend because she liked mine and I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner. Ive purchased it in the past from salon stores however i was able to get it here for half the price and it is still working perfectly even till now. I have no complaints and i will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and it&#x27;s still working great. Heats up fast and gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Hai used to make durable products.  My old flat iron lasted ages and was sturdy as a rock.  This one feels less solid.  It works but right when I got it I was disappointed at the cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 4 months</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever! Glides through your hair - never pulling. I had my first Hai flat iron for 6 year before I dropped it on my ceramic floor and broke it. I couldn&#x27;t order a replacement fast enough.</li>
            <li> While delivery was prompt and met Amazons usual high standards, the Flat Iron itself is defective and will not maintain temperature.  I am returning this item and will look for another brand.</li>
            <li> The Hai flat iron works wonderfully on my curly hair. It produces great results and is convenient to use on short or long hair</li>
            <li> A++ seller, great product</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and came earlier than expected! I am very satisfied and would buy from this seller again and recommend them to my friends!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair. In the past I could only get it straightened at the hair salon- unless I wanted to look like a scary clown. With Hai, I can finally straighten my hair on my own (not that I want to do it often). Anyway, don&#x27;t expect magical results. It is still a time-consuming process if you have long and thick hair. Not to mention you may have to use a higher temperature, which I find troubling. Overall, though, I&#x27;m quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I find that my hair looks better the next day (less puffy).</li>
            <li> My second time buying it. My old one lasted over 4 years. Good product</li>
            <li> I bought this becasue my previous hair straightener broke.  So far this product is working well and does a great job straightening my hair.  Heats up quickly and does a good job with my hair</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I also got it for a cheaper price than it normally sells in salons.</li>
            <li> 10+ year user of HAI. Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything. Best quality I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Only problem with this brand is they do not last very long.  To get a replacement you have to pay for shipping to and from.  These are great otherwise.</li>
