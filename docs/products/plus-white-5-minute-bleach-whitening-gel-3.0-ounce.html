            <li>Check on youtube there are plenty of folks using this with moldable athletic mouthguards from walmart and getting great results and provide follow up recommendations.</li>

            <li>The sample was great</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I did!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product that works.  </li>
            <li>This whitener is a good price.</li>
            <li>Price was good, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>SOME GOOD</li>
            <li>effective though, and cheap, wonderful.</li>
            <li>With your own molded teeth trays this product does a good job bleaching my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Nice whitening</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and very effective.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have the whitest smile ever!!!  </li>
            <li>I have used both and found the Q-tip more effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a year, and it works great, and gives lift to my smile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take forever to get amazing</li>
            <li>I honestly - and surprisingly - noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>However, when I opened the Amazon box, the gel had somehow exploded through the top of the bottle (the non-capped side) and was all over everything.</li>
            <li>Works better than Crest whitening strips and the Crest whitening mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My issue was mostly my bottom teeth, but I use it on the top as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it three times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a one time thing.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than five years, and swear by it.  </li>
            <li>I bought many of these at a time</li>
            <li>I love this whitening gel.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any of the do it yourself whitening strips and costs 1/5 the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and love it.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to apply, foamed and stuck to the tray pretty good.</li>
            <li>really works and got a good price</li>
            <li>Overall, good product!</li>
            <li>You can apply just as easily with a toothbrush or Q-tip.</li>
            <li>Anytime I have an important event, date, job interview, meeting, etc....</li>
            <li>I also listened to one reviewer&#x27;s advice and bought a cheap mouth guard to use as a &amp;#34;whitening tray&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh (like my dentist does ) but being hydrogen peroxide, I find it healthy for my gums.</li>
            <li>and I would feel better about my smile.</li>
            <li>Works really fast with amazing results and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li>do wonder if I received a different version of this product from the one that got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Works pretty ok but takes a lot of applications to get a kick start.</li>
            <li>consistent, just use your toothbrush to apply it, the electrical one worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>so just buy the right amount you&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li>Also works great for cleaning white gold jewelry ;)</li>
            <li>I ordered the full size.</li>
            <li>Caused sensitivity, but whitened really well!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to use it a few times to get the whiteness you desire, I&#x27;ve yet to reach that, but it&#x27;s my own fault for not using it more</li>
            <li>It definitely works and it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth or gums feeling sensitive, which is great.</li>
            <li>It makes sense to me, based on my own personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cute young lady that does make up at JcPenny&#x27;s recommend this whitener.</li>
            <li>but it sure was worth it for a last minute thing.</li>
            <li>I got it and tried it on the first day and my teeth did appear brighter (not whiter)</li>
            <li>My teeth are really white and healthy.  </li>
            <li>But I once read that hydrogen peroxide was first used to treat dental disease</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so consistent with it</li>
            <li>and like I said before I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it</li>
            <li>First of all, the package comes with a picture of a mouthpiece.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>First found this product in a discount store and tried it.  </li>
            <li>Would use it more religiously if I had a try.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t need more for a long time.</li>
            <li>If you consume something that will stain your teeth shortly after using this it will stain more than it normally would.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Apparently, after whitening, the teeth are more sensitive to staining than otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing my teeth went from yellow to white</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference#</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to pay that much anymore to get</li>
            <li>I put it on while I get ready and by the time I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>not to get it on your gums too much, owch.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t leave it on for the whole five minutes.</li>
            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>I thought because of the hydrogen peroxide content I would see brilliant results, unfortunately this was not the case.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>how much drool you&#x27;re having to deal with inside your mouth.</li>
            <li>The trays are cheap enough on Amazon, and make all the difference with the whitening results.  </li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be only available at CVS or online at amazon.</li>
            <li>It seems to be whitening my teeth and doing a decent job.</li>
            <li>I do highly, highly recommend getting the whitening trays and not just wiping it on with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li>You definitely have to use it consistently to get the whiter teeth, but it does work!</li>
            <li>This little $6 tube does more than the $120 garbage I bought at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I combine a little amount with my normal toothpaste &amp; it&#x27;s not as potent, but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I leave it on for 5 minutes, then brush as normal,</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with White Smile&#x27;s D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself)</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit, though, and you get a huge tube</li>
            <li>My gums were very sensitive afterwards...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>made my teeth VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first week, and I got a lot of compliments from people who didn&#x27;t know that I was using the gel about how white my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>dental trays (price $40 for one pair that will last many years) and one tube of Plus White will last about 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t drink coffee or dark liquids for several hours or more after use.</li>
            <li>This one was a clear sticky gel.</li>
            <li>This really makes my teeth white!</li>
            <li>I use custom-made soft silicone (?)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s whitening effect was an unexpected  side effect.  </li>
            <li>I know it works because my teeth is now whiter than an old crown I have.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference until 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li>My dentist thought I was using professional strength bleaching trays.  </li>
            <li>May try again IF it didn&#x27;t make my teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li>same as any other cheap tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li>The old crown will have to be replaced to match the new white color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply this gel, usually at night time before an important event.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with whitening tooth paste (Crest 3D white), but I don&#x27;t believe those actually work THAT much.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not amazingly white, but I can see a clear difference from before.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply to much</li>
            <li>Since I am the only user, it probably lost its effectiveness before it was used completely.</li>
            <li>White sometimes comes with a soft blue one-size-fits-all dental tray.  </li>

            <li> My teeth are not amazingly white, but I can see a clear difference from before.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply to much</li>
            <li> Since I am the only user, it probably lost its effectiveness before it was used completely.</li>
            <li> White sometimes comes with a soft blue one-size-fits-all dental tray.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to keep it in for the entire 5 minutes (10-15 minutes for the first several times).</li>
            <li> I have seen better results from using a whitening toothpaste and strips which don&#x27;t contain hydrogen peroxide and are much gentler on gums, sadly this gets a thumbs down 👎 from me!!</li>
            <li> Gave me shooting electric pain in my teeth, and my teeth felt very sensitive for a few days.</li>
            <li> For all those who spent a fortune (like me) on expensive and fancy dentistry whitening solutions that come in syringes or blue light ... this product will amaze you.  </li>
            <li> but then I haven&#x27;t used it long.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time, twice or three times a week</li>
            <li> Instead, try to get two of them and slice them apart with a very sharp knife in the middle to create one upper and one lower tray.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as some more expensive teeth whiteners and takes less time in your mouth.</li>
            <li> so I let them sit around for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> this stuff works like nobody&#x27;s business, an entire tube used non-stop would leave your mouth ultra sensitive, but if you take it slow</li>
            <li> But the tube wasn&#x27;t full and posting was ridiculously expensive for Australia</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its expectations!</li>
            <li> I would say that my yellow bottom teeth are at least 2 shades whiter after only 2 days.</li>
            <li> The Plus White box was slimy and hard to open as some of the gel had already dried.</li>
            <li> other times I mix it with my organic toothpaste</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestrips before and they didn&#x27;t hurt me as much as other people have complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects</li>
            <li> I mean I still used it and it worked regularly.</li>
            <li> It works fine, except that the upper and lower jaw are in one tray so if you are claustrophobic, it is not nice.  </li>
            <li> but without that blue white color that looks so fake.  </li>
            <li> and they are MUCH less messy.</li>
            <li> basically use it like toothpaste with an electrical toothbrush and a little of baking soda and apply for about 3 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> so I have zero expertise in this field, but after a few days of using this whitening gel, any gum inflammation is gone.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY WASTE MONEY,</li>
            <li> I usually pop those in with the gel in them when I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it does work!</li>
            <li> Usually no more than three days in a row</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure the health conditions of that</li>
            <li> They are at least 3 shades whiter than before.</li>
            <li> you want to see immediate results, don&#x27;t eat or drink anything that will stain your teeth for at least a day if not longer.</li>
            <li> You need to leave it it on for at least a 1/2 hour</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s peroxide based so it does cause a little gum irritation, but it&#x27;s usually gone within 30-60 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many expensive whitening products, even ones form my dentist and that awful kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how white my teeth have gotten.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff</li>
            <li> So tired of Whitestrips, the expense and how awkward they are on your teeth for so long!  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to sit there with this tray full of gross crap in your mouth like with this product, trying to ignore how disgusting you feel and</li>
            <li> Works, happy with it, but it does taste horrible, very very bad.</li>
            <li> it can be quiet expensive!!</li>
            <li> no difference at all, another disappointment isn&#x27;t there anything out there that works?</li>
            <li> I have bad gag reflexes</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just a bad box?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly disappointed and doubt I would purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> HATE IT  KEEP YOUR MONEY</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using this brand for awhile and ordered it here.</li>
            <li> I have been doing 5 min a day for 14 days and I can really see a difference#</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!! Sometimes I leave it on for 5 minutes, then brush as normal, other times I mix it with my organic toothpaste and I get the same results. I&#x27;m a tea drinker especially in winter, so I like to use this a couple times a week to keep my teeth as white as I can get them with this paste. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This really makes my teeth white! I don&#x27;t have to pay that much anymore to get my teeth bleached cause it can be quiet expensive!! I will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I&#x27;ve loved it. However, when I opened the Amazon box, the gel had somehow exploded through the top of the bottle (the non-capped side) and was all over everything. The Plus White box was slimy and hard to open as some of the gel had already dried. I was thoroughly disappointed and doubt I would purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> Caused sensitivity, but whitened really well!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. Anytime I have an important event, date, job interview, meeting, etc....I put it on while I get ready and by the time I&#x27;m done my teeth look flawless! It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take forever to get amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Also works great for cleaning white gold jewelry ;)</li>
            <li> delivered on time!! Liked it!!</li>
            <li> really works and got a good price</li>
            <li> Works great. The longer you leave the gel on your teeth the whiter they get. Using twice a day makes the teeth whiter as well. Works better than Crest whitening strips and the Crest whitening mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Amazing my teeth went from yellow to white</li>
            <li> I bought this and am using it with a tray that I had from another system that did not work.  I have used this TWICE and already the yellowing is gone (coffee stains, never smoked). My issue was mostly my bottom teeth, but I use it on the top as well. I&#x27;m using it with whitening tooth paste (Crest 3D white), but I don&#x27;t believe those actually work THAT much.  I would say that my yellow bottom teeth are at least 2 shades whiter after only 2 days. I&#x27;m shocked.  I have only left it on for 5 and 7 minutes.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s peroxide based so it does cause a little gum irritation, but it&#x27;s usually gone within 30-60 minutes.  I&#x27;m used to that, though, because I used to brush with peroxide and baking soda (leaves your gums white in some spots).</li>
            <li> do not do it my teeth hurt now and can my teeth don&#x27;t look any whiter</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading some of the other reviews. I also listened to one reviewer&#x27;s advice and bought a cheap mouth guard to use as a &amp;#34;whitening tray&amp;#34;. I usually pop those in with the gel in them when I&#x27;m in the shower. I noticed a difference within the first week, and I got a lot of compliments from people who didn&#x27;t know that I was using the gel about how white my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it does work! I didn&#x27;t think it would work well until I missed part of my tooth and could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it a few times to get the whiteness you desire, I&#x27;ve yet to reach that, but it&#x27;s my own fault for not using it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice a color difference but then I haven&#x27;t used it long.  I&#x27;ve used strips before and they are MUCH less messy.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to use it consistently to get the whiter teeth, but it does work! I have bad gag reflexes so it is hard to keep it in for the entire 5 minutes (10-15 minutes for the first several times). Overall, good product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works amazingly. I was shocked at how white my teeth have gotten. They are at least 3 shades whiter than before. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff this is it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work  at all, and also burnt my gums. Gave me shooting electric pain in my teeth, and my teeth felt very sensitive for a few days. I tried it three times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a one time thing. But no different experience. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> It definitely works and it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth or gums feeling sensitive, which is great. I would definitely buy again. You only need a tiny bit, though, and you get a huge tube so I won&#x27;t need more for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! great price too!</li>
            <li> I apply this gel, usually at night time before an important event. Usually no more than three days in a row and then won&#x27;t use it for another month or longer.&lt;br /&gt;The key I have found is to apply with a Q-tip (you don&#x27;t need to use a tray or a toothbrush because you&#x27;ll just get it all over your mouth and no one sees the back of your teeth) and wash the dishes or take a shower while it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see immediate results, don&#x27;t eat or drink anything that will stain your teeth for at least a day if not longer. If you consume something that will stain your teeth shortly after using this it will stain more than it normally would.&lt;br /&gt;Try not to get it on your gums too much, owch.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective though, and cheap, wonderful.</li>
            <li> I got it and tried it on the first day and my teeth did appear brighter (not whiter) but after that I saw no results. I didn&#x27;t use a mouth guard so that might have been my issue because I have seen it work for a lot of people. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> use it several times a week .love it .does get rid of nasty stains  and buildup.customer</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year, and it works great, and gives lift to my smile.</li>
            <li> Works pretty ok but takes a lot of applications to get a kick start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many expensive whitening products, even ones form my dentist and that awful kiosk at the mall. This little $6 tube does more than the $120 garbage I bought at Sephora. You will be pleased. No sensitivity either. And I don&#x27;t leave it on for the whole five minutes. Works fast.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work,</li>
            <li> For all those who spent a fortune (like me) on expensive and fancy dentistry whitening solutions that come in syringes or blue light ... this product will amaze you.  it&#x27;s cheap and very effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than five years, and swear by it.  I use custom-made soft silicone (?) dental trays (price $40 for one pair that will last many years) and one tube of Plus White will last about 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus White sometimes comes with a soft blue one-size-fits-all dental tray.  It works fine, except that the upper and lower jaw are in one tray so if you are claustrophobic, it is not nice.  Instead, try to get two of them and slice them apart with a very sharp knife in the middle to create one upper and one lower tray.  Use for up 3-5 days at a time, maximum ten days in a month, for a maximum of 5-10 minutes each time.  I use them when I shower.  My teeth are really white and healthy.  Don&#x27;t drink coffee or dark liquids for several hours or more after use. Apparently, after whitening, the teeth are more sensitive to staining than otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best of all for me?  Don&#x27;t laugh (like my dentist does ) but being hydrogen peroxide, I find it healthy for my gums. I&#x27;m not a dentist or a doctor so I have zero expertise in this field, but after a few days of using this whitening gel, any gum inflammation is gone.  This is my experience, and I am not claiming it will have the same effect on you.  But I once read that hydrogen peroxide was first used to treat dental disease and it&#x27;s whitening effect was an unexpected  side effect.  It makes sense to me, based on my own personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYW, I use the Plus White whitening gel as well as the gel toothpaste.  So far, it seems to be only available at CVS or online at amazon.</li>
            <li> This bleach works wonders. My teeth are not amazingly white, but I can see a clear difference from before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time, twice or three times a week and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;I basically use it like toothpaste with an electrical toothbrush and a little of baking soda and apply for about 3 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results don&#x27;t show up instantaneously but they do show up. I know it works because my teeth is now whiter than an old crown I have. My dentist realized the difference. The old crown will have to be replaced to match the new white color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be consistent, just use your toothbrush to apply it, the electrical one worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference until 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li> Works like a gem! I had seen reviews about this product on youtube a lot, so I tested it out &amp; IT WORKS! I combine a little amount with my normal toothpaste &amp; it&#x27;s not as potent, but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Actually whitens teeth. I wasn&#x27;t so consistent with it so I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects but it sure was worth it for a last minute thing. If I felt as if my teeth were looking yellow I would use this before I left the house and I would feel better about my smile. I bought many of these at a time and like I said before I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it so I let them sit around for a very, very long time. They ended up dissolving into a liquid. I mean I still used it and it worked regularly. I&#x27;m just not sure the health conditions of that lol so just buy the right amount you&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its expectations! I thought because of the hydrogen peroxide content I would see brilliant results, unfortunately this was not the case. My gums were very sensitive afterwards...even if I left it on for 20 - 30 minutes my teeth were no whither. Idont have very badly stained teeth but I drink tea and coffee and smoke . I have seen better results from using a whitening toothpaste and strips which don&#x27;t contain hydrogen peroxide and are much gentler on gums, sadly this gets a thumbs down 👎 from me!!</li>
            <li> Good product that works.  I have been using for years.  My dentist thought I was using professional strength bleaching trays.  Nice whitening but without that blue white color that looks so fake.  My brother is using it too for stain removal since he chews tobacco from time to time and his teeth have lightened several shades after only 3 applications.  Great for coffee and tea stains too.</li>
            <li> I love this whitening gel. Works really fast with amazing results and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth. After using this product for 5 years now I definitely  recommend it above the rest.</li>
            <li> I use this with my tooth paste and it works wonderfully :o)</li>
            <li> same as any other cheap tooth whitener.  Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I only tried this once, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness. I used this in a pre-fitted tray and followed instructions. It burned my gums and I had a sore mouth for two days with puffy tender gums. I will not use this again. I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive teeth or gums. I&#x27;ve used whitestrips before and they didn&#x27;t hurt me as much as other people have complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder if I received a different version of this product from the one that got so many good reviews. This one was a clear sticky gel. Someone else compared it to vaseline, and it is a bit like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Rembrandt whitening mouth wash now. I really like it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt! And as a big bonus, it&#x27;s just a mouth wash so you don&#x27;t have to sit there with this tray full of gross crap in your mouth like with this product, trying to ignore how disgusting you feel and how much drool you&#x27;re having to deal with inside your mouth. Yuck and ouch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t spend a fortune to whiten your teeth.  I&#x60;&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works great.  You need to leave it it on for at least a 1/2 hour</li>
            <li> The stuff was too liquidy when we received it. There was no gel consistency to it at all and it didn&#x27;t work. Maybe it was just a bad box? Who knows.</li>
            <li> I bought this just as a &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have the time or money to go to the dentist to have my teeth bleached&amp;#34; thought.  I am thrilled that I did!  First of all, the package comes with a picture of a mouthpiece. Just know that it does NOT come with one. You can apply just as easily with a toothbrush or Q-tip. I have used both and found the Q-tip more effective. Five minutes and there was a noticeable difference!  So tired of Whitestrips, the expense and how awkward they are on your teeth for so long!  This is a great solution!  Five stars!</li>
            <li> Works, happy with it, but it does taste horrible, very very bad. Be careful not to apply to much so you don&#x27;t taste it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.  I honestly - and surprisingly - noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> It seems to be whitening my teeth and doing a decent job. I do highly, highly recommend getting the whitening trays and not just wiping it on with a q-tip.  The trays are cheap enough on Amazon, and make all the difference with the whitening results.  I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I was getting 3.0 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;It was only 2.0 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a rip off since the reason I bought it was for the extra ounce.</li>
            <li> Got a bit sensetive gums so I stopped but the product seems to work.  The product was easy to apply, foamed and stuck to the tray pretty good. So I was sattisfied.</li>
            <li> had to stop using after the forth day... made my teeth VERY sensitive. (didn&#x27;t see any results within the 4 days of use). May try again IF it didn&#x27;t make my teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li> box was opened though.</li>
            <li> With your own molded teeth trays this product does a good job bleaching my teeth. It won&#x27;t zoom whiten them in one sitting BUT your pocket won&#x27;t be zoomed either. Check on youtube there are plenty of folks using this with moldable athletic mouthguards from walmart and getting great results and provide follow up recommendations.</li>
            <li> This whitener is a good price. A cute young lady that does make up at JcPenny&#x27;s recommend this whitener. Her teeth was really white. I guess it will work.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly great. Will definitely be buying more But the tube wasn&#x27;t full and posting was ridiculously expensive for Australia</li>
            <li> this stuff works like nobody&#x27;s business, an entire tube used non-stop would leave your mouth ultra sensitive, but if you take it slow you&#x27;ll have the whitest smile ever!!!  I used it in conjunction with White Smile&#x27;s D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) Moldable THERMOFITTING 3 Teeth Whitening Trays and that helps it sit on the teeth rather than just foam off....</li>
            <li> I have been using it two week no difference at all, another disappointment isn&#x27;t there anything out there that works?</li>
            <li> Excellent value, great product</li>
            <li> First found this product in a discount store and tried it.  The sample was great but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  I ordered the full size. Price was good, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> People are always commenting on how white my teeth are!!!! Only a couple of uses and there is a BIG difference!!!</li>
            <li> Works as well as some more expensive teeth whiteners and takes less time in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a maintenance boost. Works well.</li>
            <li> A very good product for the price.  If several people in the household used it, then it would definitely be the one to keep ordering. Since I am the only user, it probably lost its effectiveness before it was used completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it now because I think  it didn&#x27;t works..</li>
            <li> Product probably works, but I&#x27;ve lost interest in doing it twice a day cause I don&#x27;t have a mouth try.  Putting it on my teeth with a q-tip works, but it&#x27;s a bit of a pain.  Would use it more religiously if I had a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any of the do it yourself whitening strips and costs 1/5 the cost. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and love it. I don&#x27;t get any of that tooth sensitivity that I get with the strips and you can notice results in a couple of days if you leave it in for 20-25 min</li>
            <li> Just another jell you must put on your teeth, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait....  You get the picture.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY WASTE MONEY, HATE IT  KEEP YOUR MONEY AN GET  SOME GOOD ONE TIME DIDN&#x27;T DO ANY THING</li>
