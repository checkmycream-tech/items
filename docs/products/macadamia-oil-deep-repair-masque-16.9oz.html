            <li>and it works just fine to keep it out of my way while the rest of my life goes on.</li>

            <li>The scent is pretty and light and who wouldn&#x27;t like the cute packaging?</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for my hair to restore it&#x27;s original state</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it prevents damage since I use many products to protect my hair, but with how soft my hair is after I shower I like to believe it is doing something :)</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly to make my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I could literally comb right through my hair!</li>

            <li>have damaged hair and spilt ends from coloring and hair that already tangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Besides It&#x27;s a great deal, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li>It has a tropical, fresh clean scent that is irresistible.</li>
            <li>and you get a super dooper mask.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has some super ingredients and I like to change around my products as my hairdresser recommended I do this so even though you can get a lower priced product as one reviewer claimed that works as well</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never seen a better day since high school</li>
            <li>I normally use Pureology&#x27;s Hydrate, but this stuff works better for me.</li>
            <li>Like I never used color or hot tools in my hair!</li>
            <li>Highly recomended!!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, mine was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>DEF WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>It is on the pricey side, but it is SO WORTH</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been more moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was literally in tears, FINALLY something that agrees with my hair AND its almost as effective as a perm.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft while keeping my hair healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels really fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li>The exciting part everyone could notice the change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and so far I love</li>
            <li>I just reordered it because it does a nice job adding extra conditioning to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I mean cheap price for too may things Happy about it</li>
            <li>so it gets dry easily, but after using this product I never have that problem any more.</li>
            <li>works just as good as other brand names products.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair and after I used the macadamia oil masque, I noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Both provide the super moisturizing, hydration my very thirsty 3c/4a curls need.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>It feels so light , smooth and like I&#x27;d mentioned it earlier, the scent is just to die for.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li>Best to use a dark towel to dry hair afterwards!</li>
            <li>Another plus is that if u need to wash your hear more often (i do it every other day) you can use your regular cinditioner and be sure that your hair will stay smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>but I can say that this mask is definitely giving a huge helping hand!</li>
            <li>The first word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li>I initially bought the one ounce sample and realized I needed more.</li>
            <li>It has not worked any miracles, but it works much better than regular conditioners do.</li>
            <li>Love this product,  it is truly a deep conditioning masque that does not require heat.  </li>
            <li>I love to dye my hair and it brings back all the bounce and volume and softness!</li>
            <li>so not too much to release dandruff !</li>
            <li>Amount is also pretty sufficient(got</li>
            <li>is my hair after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>When I ordered it, it was my first think I ordered from Amazon</li>
            <li>I just started using this product about two weeks ago, and I can see the different, my hairs became more a life, not like before.</li>
            <li>I really love this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different hair masks to repair my damaged hair but this one just blows them all out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!  </li>
            <li>I bleached my hair, so my hair is pretty damaged now.  </li>
            <li>Macademia has long lasting efect and even if used only twice a week it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>However, I personally found it wasn&#x27;t any better than Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Hydrating Masque at Sallys Beauty Supply for $7.99.</li>
            <li>I use this every day, and it always makes my hair super soft...</li>
            <li>It smells incredible and a little REALLY goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is after rinsing as directed, the product seems to leave a light brown stain on the towel.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS, ITS VERY RUNNY</li>
            <li>and it was processed rather fast.</li>
            <li>Using it will see how well it is really.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li>I work in a very dehydrating environment and use it either once or twice a week, depending on my schedule.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I will stick to Pantene Pro- V Intense treatment.....</li>
            <li>Really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this about 2x/week after my violet shampoo which REALLY dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it really works.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>and did wonders fro my daughters hair...in fact any family member who stays long enough to shower is talking into trying it, and everyone has loved it thus far, something i will repurchase!</li>
            <li>I originally heard about it from several, and</li>
            <li>I use the Macadamia healing oil as well, and love the way it makes my dry hair soft and silky!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure you get a super big amount that is guaranteed to last you through many many hair conditioning sessions.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged and dry because of using iron but by using this product, now I have my healthy, soft hair.</li>
            <li>I got my hair done with a halo look, so it is bleached thru out my top half of my head.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair tangle free, soft, and smelling delicious; and the smell really lingers which I like but may be annoying for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive products and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it out with high expectations.</li>
            <li>The 16.9 oz is really big and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is soft, easy to brush wet</li>
            <li>and I loved it, a little goes a long way and it made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tryied dozens of live in or rinse of masks or conditioners but none of them can compare to this one.</li>
            <li>so I have always trying new product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>so well and makes my hair seem very soft.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I usually have to use tons of hair gel to get it in to place, but with this masque my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>So soft!  </li>
            <li>I first used this product 3 years ago after I burned my hair with a flat iron and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Seems to last long because you are only suppose to use it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>I have such coarse hair that my scalp dries up so quickly &#x3D; knots up.</li>
            <li>Terrific prize for the large size.</li>
            <li>the large bowl)  will last me for a year if used as adviced which is twice a week.</li>
            <li>But after I used this and used my blow drier for the first time in years I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron!!  </li>
            <li>Wow wow wow</li>
            <li>Recently, my hair began not responding to the WEN, much to my dismay.  </li>
            <li>Protein bonds to the hair and makes it stronger, but too much will cause it to become coarse and lifeless.</li>
            <li>It was hydrating and softened my natural curls as promised.</li>
            <li>However, unlike my Biolage conditioner, the hair still feels lush and soft even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>AND I DIDNT REALLY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, smooth,and it give it lots of moisture .I</li>
            <li>do get lot of shine but its a natural shine not an oily shine it</li>
            <li>I use this every week and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>again afterwards~  soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if your hair is damaged by too much coloring or bleaching.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>So far, I like the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>(my hair is naturally oily</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky soft and shiny without having to use any shine enhancement products after.  </li>
            <li>I noticed people complained about the smell, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money since the smaller 8oz tub is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone looking for extra moisture, manageable and soft hair!</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice subtle scent in your hair after being rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the deep repair masque works wonders.</li>
            <li>I DEF recommend this product if you&#x27;re serious about restoring your hair and making it healthy or just maintaining it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I only left it on for 3 minutes instead of the recommended 6-7mins.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I left it for about 10 minutes with a shower cap on so the mask can soak in a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample package a few times and had to buy a full size one.</li>
            <li>It brought life back to my damaged hair and now it makes it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s shine due to too much heat styling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this for dry, damaged, flat, frizzy, color treated, oily or any combination of hair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY, I compared the ingredients and definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>This works great,,makes my hair soft and manageable and last several days.</li>
            <li>My hair is very wild, dry, and curly.</li>
            <li>Your hair is so soft once you start rinsing and after I air dry my hair its even softer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and soft with no residue left in it when its dry.</li>

            <li> It cost a bit more, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I used it only once and plan on using it once/week for maintenance, smells really good too!</li>
            <li> ,only shipping is more but great price</li>

            <li> I have to say I completely agree.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the masque smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair mask I tried, better than Kerastaste Nutritive Masquintense &amp; Professional Expert Serie-Absolut Repair Cellular Mask and etc.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine to keep it out of my way while the rest of my life goes on.</li>

            <li> The scent is pretty and light and who wouldn&#x27;t like the cute packaging?</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for my hair to restore it&#x27;s original state</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it prevents damage since I use many products to protect my hair, but with how soft my hair is after I shower I like to believe it is doing something :)</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly to make my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I could literally comb right through my hair!</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to see how quickly I received.</li>
            <li> From the first use my hair are smooth silky and freez free.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much smoother and more manageable.</li>

            <li> My wife says that the product is fabulous and leaves hair healthy and very soft has recommended it to her friends</li>
            <li> have damaged hair and spilt ends from coloring and hair that already tangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Besides It&#x27;s a great deal, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> It has a tropical, fresh clean scent that is irresistible.</li>
            <li> and you get a super dooper mask.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has some super ingredients and I like to change around my products as my hairdresser recommended I do this so even though you can get a lower priced product as one reviewer claimed that works as well</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never seen a better day since high school</li>
            <li> I normally use Pureology&#x27;s Hydrate, but this stuff works better for me.</li>
            <li> Like I never used color or hot tools in my hair!</li>
            <li> Highly recomended!!!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, mine was the real thing.  </li>
            <li> DEF WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It is on the pricey side, but it is SO WORTH</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been more moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was literally in tears, FINALLY something that agrees with my hair AND its almost as effective as a perm.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft while keeping my hair healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels really fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li> The exciting part everyone could notice the change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and so far I love</li>
            <li> I just reordered it because it does a nice job adding extra conditioning to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean cheap price for too may things Happy about it</li>
            <li> so it gets dry easily, but after using this product I never have that problem any more.</li>
            <li> works just as good as other brand names products.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and after I used the macadamia oil masque, I noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Both provide the super moisturizing, hydration my very thirsty 3c/4a curls need.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> It feels so light , smooth and like I&#x27;d mentioned it earlier, the scent is just to die for.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> Best to use a dark towel to dry hair afterwards!</li>
            <li> Another plus is that if u need to wash your hear more often (i do it every other day) you can use your regular cinditioner and be sure that your hair will stay smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> but I can say that this mask is definitely giving a huge helping hand!</li>
            <li> The first word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the one ounce sample and realized I needed more.</li>
            <li> It has not worked any miracles, but it works much better than regular conditioners do.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  it is truly a deep conditioning masque that does not require heat.  </li>
            <li> I love to dye my hair and it brings back all the bounce and volume and softness!</li>
            <li> so not too much to release dandruff !</li>
            <li> Amount is also pretty sufficient(got</li>
            <li> is my hair after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, it was my first think I ordered from Amazon</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about two weeks ago, and I can see the different, my hairs became more a life, not like before.</li>
            <li> I really love this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different hair masks to repair my damaged hair but this one just blows them all out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!  </li>
            <li> I bleached my hair, so my hair is pretty damaged now.  </li>
            <li> Macademia has long lasting efect and even if used only twice a week it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> However, I personally found it wasn&#x27;t any better than Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Hydrating Masque at Sallys Beauty Supply for $7.99.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, and it always makes my hair super soft...</li>
            <li> It smells incredible and a little REALLY goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is after rinsing as directed, the product seems to leave a light brown stain on the towel.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS, ITS VERY RUNNY</li>
            <li> and it was processed rather fast.</li>
            <li> Using it will see how well it is really.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li> I work in a very dehydrating environment and use it either once or twice a week, depending on my schedule.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I will stick to Pantene Pro- V Intense treatment.....</li>
            <li> Really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this about 2x/week after my violet shampoo which REALLY dries my hair out.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really works.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> and did wonders fro my daughters hair...in fact any family member who stays long enough to shower is talking into trying it, and everyone has loved it thus far, something i will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I originally heard about it from several, and</li>
            <li> I use the Macadamia healing oil as well, and love the way it makes my dry hair soft and silky!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure you get a super big amount that is guaranteed to last you through many many hair conditioning sessions.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and dry because of using iron but by using this product, now I have my healthy, soft hair.</li>
            <li> I got my hair done with a halo look, so it is bleached thru out my top half of my head.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair tangle free, soft, and smelling delicious; and the smell really lingers which I like but may be annoying for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive products and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it out with high expectations.</li>
            <li> The 16.9 oz is really big and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is soft, easy to brush wet</li>
            <li> and I loved it, a little goes a long way and it made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tryied dozens of live in or rinse of masks or conditioners but none of them can compare to this one.</li>
            <li> so I have always trying new product.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> so well and makes my hair seem very soft.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I usually have to use tons of hair gel to get it in to place, but with this masque my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> So soft!  </li>
            <li> I first used this product 3 years ago after I burned my hair with a flat iron and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Seems to last long because you are only suppose to use it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> I have such coarse hair that my scalp dries up so quickly &#x3D; knots up.</li>
            <li> Terrific prize for the large size.</li>
            <li> the large bowl)  will last me for a year if used as adviced which is twice a week.</li>
            <li> But after I used this and used my blow drier for the first time in years I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron!!  </li>
            <li> Wow wow wow</li>
            <li> Recently, my hair began not responding to the WEN, much to my dismay.  </li>
            <li> Protein bonds to the hair and makes it stronger, but too much will cause it to become coarse and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It was hydrating and softened my natural curls as promised.</li>
            <li> However, unlike my Biolage conditioner, the hair still feels lush and soft even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> AND I DIDNT REALLY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, smooth,and it give it lots of moisture .I</li>
            <li> do get lot of shine but its a natural shine not an oily shine it</li>
            <li> I use this every week and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> again afterwards~  soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if your hair is damaged by too much coloring or bleaching.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> So far, I like the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> (my hair is naturally oily</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky soft and shiny without having to use any shine enhancement products after.  </li>
            <li> I noticed people complained about the smell, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money since the smaller 8oz tub is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone looking for extra moisture, manageable and soft hair!</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice subtle scent in your hair after being rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the deep repair masque works wonders.</li>
            <li> I DEF recommend this product if you&#x27;re serious about restoring your hair and making it healthy or just maintaining it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I only left it on for 3 minutes instead of the recommended 6-7mins.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I left it for about 10 minutes with a shower cap on so the mask can soak in a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample package a few times and had to buy a full size one.</li>
            <li> It brought life back to my damaged hair and now it makes it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s shine due to too much heat styling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this for dry, damaged, flat, frizzy, color treated, oily or any combination of hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY, I compared the ingredients and definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> This works great,,makes my hair soft and manageable and last several days.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wild, dry, and curly.</li>
            <li> Your hair is so soft once you start rinsing and after I air dry my hair its even softer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and soft with no residue left in it when its dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair after a lot of abuse..coloring, blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that this tub will last me for a long while~</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve dye, flat iron, blow dry my hair often so it has been physically and chemically abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually use it every day since I have wavy/curly and prone to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I switch it around with Kheil&#x27;s Olive Hair Masque and Aveda&#x27;s  hair Masque and find this product definitely in the same class with other well known products so to those who give it less stars for the pricing I don&#x27;t agree due to the large quantity, amount needed and results.</li>
            <li> I have to blow dry and flat iron every time I wash</li>
            <li> it left my hair so soft its hard to use it ONLY once a week</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it coats onto your hair making even wet hair feel soft and lush and thick.</li>
            <li> i ordered to help the ends of my hair which are so damaged and also for my daughter who has really bad dry damaged hair, THIS STuFF IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> First, in all fairness to my five star review you get a lot of product for the money and only need a little to cover my longish thick hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use any other products after I get out of shower because this works so well, and oh BTW I use this as my conditioner because I only wash my hair like 3 days a eel anyway!</li>
            <li> I know all hair types are different, but if you have dry&amp;coarse African American hair, Buy a small case off of here and try it out.</li>
            <li> I have dry damaged hair from years of abuse from hair color and styling.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, curly hair, like me, this product is a MUST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, damaged, bleached hair, and it seems to help it.</li>
            <li> I color it, I beach it, and I have it thinned out which makes it dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> hair before was dry and damaged but this product saved my hair</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair (half black, half white), so it&#x27;s more difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair, use this product!</li>
            <li> Had I not found a similar product for less money that works just as well on my hair</li>
            <li> So I would recommend it but rather get the same result for less money.</li>
            <li> It cost me less than it would at Ulta, and it&#x27;s the same product!</li>
            <li> Cut down air drying time and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it had little affect on the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pity</li>
            <li> I have middle length hair with coloring and a few days per week of heat styling.</li>
            <li> So when I put this on and combed it through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy naturally curly hair and this conditions</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time, you just need a little bit each use.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for several hours before washing out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can built up; so you need a clarifying shampoo every other Sunday when you don&#x27;t do hair</li>
            <li> bath tube will be extremely slippery, so be-careful.</li>
            <li> I use it once every other week and my hair is  looking healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 30 different hair masks, which I will wear over night.</li>
            <li> have thick coarse strands that lost it</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with an extra volume shampoo from garnier fructis, I toweled dry the hair, scooped out approximately 3 tbsp of the creamy mask and raked it into the hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean SEVERAL, beauty gurus on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I have black hair.</li>
            <li> so I found the 500ml for less than 30 bucks but let me tell u,</li>
            <li> Seems to keep my hair straighter and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> and my hair is long and can get hard and snarled.</li>
            <li> Over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on hair products trying to find something that would repair my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have long THICK hair.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is so thick that if I let it air dry it would take literally 4 hours)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my hair is soft, thick, doesn&#x27;t get oily/greasy as fast, is shinier, styles easier, isn&#x27;t as frizzy or poofy, and has grown like crazy!</li>
            <li> i like to use it when i feel my hair is getting a little dry&lt;</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few days ago</li>
            <li> It had a lot of split ends and it looked soooo dead.</li>
            <li> and I use this for a few months.</li>
            <li> Then I squeezed all the water out and blow dried my hair to minimize frizz.</li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased everything under sun and spare not cost because I have unhealthy and dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, bouncy and shiny which is difficult to achieve when you have thick, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> When a product says resorative, reconstructing or repair treatment it usually means they&#x27;re protein based</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair after work and put in the mask then make dinner,eat,watch a movie and rinse it out before bed.</li>
            <li> I have hair past my hips</li>
            <li> I want to use this everyday!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of this melts away all my tangles and leaves my hair supersoft and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any ordinary conditioner.</li>
            <li> so no need to go overboard)</li>
            <li> I leave it on my hair under a shower cap, usually with a towel wrapped around my head for about 30-60 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I usually keep it in my hair for a couple of hours</li>
            <li> It was very thick, has a slight yellowish pearlized color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I will saturate my hair with the conditioner, and leave it in for at least 4 hours then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thick, curly hair that I get chemically straightened every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the results of the hair mask as it restored some shine and smoothness of my thick strands after just one use.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> pumps, I hate scooping the product out with my hands, because it gets too slippery to put the cap back</li>
            <li> Reading all the negative reviews on fake products, I was afraid of the purchase I&#x27;d just made thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this product for the longest time but its way too expensive</li>
            <li> Some say they received a fake.</li>
            <li> so my hair is always desperate for any type of moisture it can get.</li>
            <li> so I desperately needed something to save my strands.</li>
            <li> I blew it out with cold air</li>
            <li> After I would wash my hair and condition it, brushing was painful.</li>
            <li> I hate writing reviews</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This masque smells really, REALLY good (like I could still smell it in my hair 12 hours later) but I feel like it had little affect on the overall health of my hair. On the days where I would use it, my hair was noticeably softer and smoother but in the long run, I feel like it&#x27;s not worth the price because it didn&#x27;t really have any lasting affects.</li>
            <li> The first word that comes to mind. I hate writing reviews but I can go on all day about how great this product is. I use it twice a week, I rub it in, put my hair in a pony tail, wash my body and face,then rinse out the masque. Your hair is so soft once you start rinsing and after I air dry my hair its even softer. I could go for days on this product. DEF WORTH THE PRICE. It lasts a really long time, you just need a little bit each use.</li>
            <li> My roommate bought this product and insisted I try it and I instantly fell in love!!! I bleach my hair blonde so my hair is always desperate for any type of moisture it can get. I tried every product out there from Dove leave in conditioners to hair milk and nothing worked like this!! It leaves my hair silky and soft with no residue left in it when its dry. I don&#x27;t even need to use straightning products anymore because my hair always feels like I just came back from the salon. This is a must have and is a great deal for the amount of product you get &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am and have been a regular WEN user, for close to a year.  I have dry damaged hair from years of abuse from hair color and styling.  Recently, my hair began not responding to the WEN, much to my dismay.  I&#x27;ve recently come to the conclusion that I may be using the styling cream incorrectly, however, I bought this in hopes that I could get similar results while I gave my hair a rest from the WEN.  I definately like it!  I will keep this stuff on hand as a back up to my WEN.  I use the Macadamia healing oil as well, and love the way it makes my dry hair soft and silky!  Try it!  :)</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have tried. If you have really dry hair, use this product! The only drawback is after rinsing as directed, the product seems to leave a light brown stain on the towel. Best to use a dark towel to dry hair afterwards!</li>
            <li> If you have dry, curly hair, like me, this product is a MUST. It&#x27;s very thick &amp; heavy. I use this every day, and it always makes my hair super soft...I&#x27;ve never had the feeling that the conditioner \\&quot;stopped working.\\&quot; Great price on Amazon, too...it goes for much more in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. It&#x27;s truly for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Terrific prize for the large size. I like to wash my hair, leave the masque on, and go workout. When I shower after the gym my hair is so silky and smooth. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Not very often do I find a product that blows my mind, but this one surprised me. I initially bought the one ounce sample and realized I needed more. During the application I noticed my fingers easily gliding through, immediate results! Cut down air drying time and flat ironing. The end result? My hair is soft, bouncy and shiny which is difficult to achieve when you have thick, wavy, color treated hair. When a product says resorative, reconstructing or repair treatment it usually means they&#x27;re protein based so make sure to follow the alloted usage. Protein bonds to the hair and makes it stronger, but too much will cause it to become coarse and lifeless. I use it twice a week and look forward to it every time! I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this for dry, damaged, flat, frizzy, color treated, oily or any combination of hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few days ago and I got it in only about 3 days! Fastest shipment yet! I tried this product tonight and I loved it, a little goes a long way and it made my hair feel so soft. Like I never used color or hot tools in my hair! I recommend this to anyone! I don&#x27;t have to use any other products after I get out of shower because this works so well, and oh BTW I use this as my conditioner because I only wash my hair like 3 days a eel anyway!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair tangle free, soft, and smelling delicious; and the smell really lingers which I like but may be annoying for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It smells great and does exaclty what it says it&#x27;s supposed to. It moisturizes and helps keep your hair managable and healthy. I use it for longer than 7 minutes which is the recommended time. I usually wash my hair after work and put in the mask then make dinner,eat,watch a movie and rinse it out before bed. So a good 3 hours I would say. I keep my hair wrapped in like a disposable shower cap while I have it in my hair and it works just fine to keep it out of my way while the rest of my life goes on. I DEF recommend this product if you&#x27;re serious about restoring your hair and making it healthy or just maintaining it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have TYPE 3B curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I have dry, damaged, bleached hair, and it seems to help it. It has not worked any miracles, but it works much better than regular conditioners do. I normally use Pureology&#x27;s Hydrate, but this stuff works better for me. When I use it, I will saturate my hair with the conditioner, and leave it in for at least 4 hours then rinse it out. It also smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Makes hair super soft and smells wonderful!  I highly recommend to anyone looking for extra moisture, manageable and soft hair!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair after a lot of abuse..coloring, blow drying and flat ironing. It was hydrating and softened my natural curls as promised. However, I personally found it wasn&#x27;t any better than Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Hydrating Masque at Sallys Beauty Supply for $7.99. Had I not found a similar product for less money that works just as well on my hair I would have given it five stars. Both provide the super moisturizing, hydration my very thirsty 3c/4a curls need. So I would recommend it but rather get the same result for less money.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after some intensive research. I originally heard about it from several, and I mean SEVERAL, beauty gurus on YouTube. Then I looked up online reviews and such. In all my research, I read/saw no bad reviews. NONE! I have to say I completely agree.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the masque smells AMAZING! It has a tropical, fresh clean scent that is irresistible. The smell is strong, but its not a bad or overpowering smell at all. It leaves a nice subtle scent in your hair after being rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the deep repair masque works wonders. When you apply it, it coats onto your hair making even wet hair feel soft and lush and thick. It feels a lot like my Biolage Hydratherapie Conditioner (which I love!). However, unlike my Biolage conditioner, the hair still feels lush and soft even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a definite buy! It is on the pricey side, but it is SO WORTH THE MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;I have damaged hair and spilt ends from coloring and hair that already tangled pretty easily. This product has brought my hair back to life. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my hair is soft, thick, doesn&#x27;t get oily/greasy as fast, is shinier, styles easier, isn&#x27;t as frizzy or poofy, and has grown like crazy! This product is a definite MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> This is just one of those products that you have to keep in your shower, it is great for regular use or a mask. I love all of their products. Works best in combination with their oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  it is truly a deep conditioning masque that does not require heat.  I have tried many expensive products and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel wonderful.  I usually leave it on for several hours before washing out.  I love to dye my hair and it brings back all the bounce and volume and softness!</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONING MASQUE DOESNT SEEM LIKE IT WORKS, ITS VERY RUNNY AND I DIDNT REALLY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Great, awesome, amaizing, fantastic!! Mix it with the macademia oil and you get a super dooper mask. Take your time and keep it on your hair for more than 15 minutes and you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> The produtct is wonderfull! My hair is much better since I&#x27;ve been using it. Besides, the smell of it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hair because its make my head so many dandruff..&lt;br /&gt;I use it 1 time a week ..so not too much to release dandruff !</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great for my hair.  second time buying this.  works just as good as other brand names products.  worth the money.</li>
            <li> This thing really works !!!  I&#x27;ve tryied dozens of live in or rinse of masks or conditioners but none of them can compare to this one. From the first use my hair are smooth silky and freez free. Amount is also pretty sufficient(got the large bowl)  will last me for a year if used as adviced which is twice a week. Another plus is that if u need to wash your hear more often (i do it every other day) you can use your regular cinditioner and be sure that your hair will stay smooth and silky. Macademia has long lasting efect and even if used only twice a week it does the job perfectly. Highly recomended!!! Give it a try i&#x27;m sur you will not regret.</li>
            <li> It does what it said it will.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth untangled  hair.&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasted 30+ hours after last use.&lt;br /&gt;Silky effect lasted for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Make my colored-hair more vibrant :)&lt;br /&gt;This is my hair after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It can built up; so you need a clarifying shampoo every other Sunday when you don&#x27;t do hair masque.&lt;br /&gt;Can get pricey, so wait for sales.&lt;br /&gt;No pumps, I hate scooping the product out with my hands, because it gets too slippery to put the cap back on.&lt;br /&gt;Your bath tube will be extremely slippery, so be-careful.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Unbelieveably low price.  My hair has never been more moisturized and soft.  This is a great deal. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This Product is amazing! I tried a sample package a few times and had to buy a full size one. I use it as directed, and it makes my hair extremely smooth and shinny. I have hair past my hips so it gets dry easily, but after using this product I never have that problem any more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. When I ordered it, it was my first think I ordered from Amazon and it was processed rather fast. It was shipped even sooner and I received it in no time. I was soo excited to see how quickly I received. I recommend this product to everyone. It makes your hair feel soooo GREAT and smells even GREATER! Give it a try.. I promise you will fall in love!</li>
            <li> Over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on hair products trying to find something that would repair my damaged hair. I&#x27;ve purchased at least 30 different hair masks, which I will wear over night. This one has been the most effective so far. I love it! It makes my hair soft and strong. And it smells amazing too. The 16.9 oz is really big and definitely worth the money. Great product!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, smooth,and it give it lots of moisture .I like this stuff alot i just wish it was cheap .i do get lot of shine but its a natural shine not an oily shine it and it really great for new growth plus you don&#x27;t have to use alot you just need  alittle bit its great.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells absolutely amazing and has a lot of slip for a conditioner.  I actually use it every day since I have wavy/curly and prone to dry hair.</li>
            <li> The mask smells wonderful and the hair is soft after the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pity there is a recommended limit to the number of times I can use this a week. I want to use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this was a quicker shipping and that you also put trial sizes of the agadir argan oil in the package! it was so great! I just ran out of my own so its awesome to have extras!</li>
            <li> I have black hair. I got my hair done with a halo look, so it is bleached thru out my top half of my head. After I would wash my hair and condition it, brushing was painful. It felt like hay. I found this stuff at one of my local stores so I got it. WOW!!! Now my hair is soft, easy to brush wet and it looks smooth. I recommend this stuff to everyone. It cost a bit more, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this every week and it makes my hair so soft. I don&#x27;t know how well it prevents damage since I use many products to protect my hair, but with how soft my hair is after I shower I like to believe it is doing something :)</li>
            <li> Reading all the negative reviews on fake products, I was afraid of the purchase I&#x27;d just made thru Amazon.  Fortunately, mine was the real thing.  It was very thick, has a slight yellowish pearlized color.  The scent is just heaven!  After washing my hair with an extra volume shampoo from garnier fructis, I toweled dry the hair, scooped out approximately 3 tbsp of the creamy mask and raked it into the hair.  Washed it out after 5 min or so ( don&#x27;t try to rinse all of it out).  My hair has never seen a better day since high school and I&#x27;m 38.  It feels so light , smooth and like I&#x27;d mentioned it earlier, the scent is just to die for.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  pricey and there was no factory seal</li>
            <li> This has totally transformed my hair. No, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of split ends-- you still have to get a hair cut for that; but it did hydrate my hair like nothing else has.  I use this after a clarifying shampoo once a week-- which has worked out perfectly. The scent is pretty and light and who wouldn&#x27;t like the cute packaging? I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> Very good as I wished.But it will do for now. Using it will see how well it is really. would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and leaves my hair soft and silky. I am in the ocean many times a week and my hair is long and can get hard and snarled. Just a small amount of this melts away all my tangles and leaves my hair supersoft and silky. This size container will last me months it&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li> Really nice and Good product I ordered ,only shipping is more but great price I mean cheap price for too may things Happy about it</li>
            <li> My hair is overprocessed and this masque is the best I have tried.  Hair feels like &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34; again afterwards~  soft and manageable.  The scent is great and the texture is very creamy.  Love this.</li>
            <li> this product works amazingly good. i like to use it when i feel my hair is getting a little dry&lt;br /&gt;i totally recommend it</li>
            <li> Large size, this is a great repair masque for hair.  Product came quickly.  I definitely recommend this product if your hair is damaged by too much coloring or bleaching.</li>
            <li> I have middle length hair with coloring and a few days per week of heat styling. It had a lot of split ends and it looked soooo dead. Decided to trimmed 2 inches off and I use this for a few months. Now my hair feels amazing. It&#x27;s softer and the leftover split ends are being nourished. Great price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I had de Moroccan oil mask, and it didn&#x27;t work as good as this one. Besides It&#x27;s a great deal, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other places. Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything AMAZING. It&#x27;s just like any ordinary conditioner. Believe me ladies -if a product that can \\&quot;repair\\&quot; hair existed, then no one would complain about their hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel wonderful!  I recommend this to any one with color-treated/damaged hair.  Leave it on for 7 min and have beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I have used in years.  I use it twice a week and it nourishes my hair without causing greasiness.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow wow wow! I have such coarse hair that my scalp dries up so quickly &#x3D; knots up.So when I put this on and combed it through my wet hair. I was in AWE. I could literally comb right through my hair! And i wast fighting with it. I was literally in tears, FINALLY something that agrees with my hair AND its almost as effective as a perm. My hair LOVES Macadamia. I know all hair types are different, but if you have dry&amp;coarse African American hair, Buy a small case off of here and try it out. Just once, try it. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I now have manageable hair. And at that price, using it only once a week, I can afford to put some money aside each week to make sure my hair is looking GOOD :D</li>
            <li> I first used this product 3 years ago after I burned my hair with a flat iron and have used it ever since.  It brought life back to my damaged hair and now it makes it soft and silky.  My daughters use it as well as thier friends.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet! I will update my review after usage! So far, I like the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> i ordered to help the ends of my hair which are so damaged and also for my daughter who has really bad dry damaged hair, THIS STuFF IS AMAZING. it left my hair so soft its hard to use it ONLY once a week (my hair is naturally oily so no need to go overboard) and did wonders fro my daughters hair...in fact any family member who stays long enough to shower is talking into trying it, and everyone has loved it thus far, something i will repurchase!</li>
            <li> My wife says that the product is fabulous and leaves hair healthy and very soft has recommended it to her friends</li>
            <li> My grandaughter uses this product she was very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two of them i would order them again</li>
            <li> I bought this since i was needing a deep repair masque for my split ends and i use it twice a week for 20minutes at a time and it has made my hair soft, untangled,less frizzy,smoothed out my split ends and smells wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected: great product, very hydrating, loved it. I have curly frizzy hair and this smooths it very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and after I used the macadamia oil masque, I noticed the difference right away.  My hair feels so much smoother and more manageable. I used it only once and plan on using it once/week for maintenance, smells really good too! very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this product for the longest time but its way too expensive so I found the 500ml for less than 30 bucks but let me tell u, DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY, I compared the ingredients and definitely not the same. I bought mine from canasbeauty so don&#x27;t trust them.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about two weeks ago, and I can see the different, my hairs became more a life, not like before. I like this product.</li>
            <li> It cost me less than it would at Ulta, and it&#x27;s the same product! Helps my bleach-damaged hair recover, I use it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> i never whrite reviews but i had to tell the world how amazing this product is, your hair smells great when you put this repair masque, but the best part is that it does repair your hair, and your hair is so soft and smooth.. i just love this thing and you have to try this...</li>
            <li> I really love this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque. It makes my hair so soft while keeping my hair healthy and moisturized. Some say they received a fake. but mine was authentic.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioning masque we have ever used.  My hair has never been as strong as it is with the use if Macadamia.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  It leaves my hair silky soft and shiny without having to use any shine enhancement products after.  I leave it on my hair under a shower cap, usually with a towel wrapped around my head for about 30-60 minutes.  I&#x27;ll do housework  or work on the computer to kill the time.  I noticed people complained about the smell, but I love it.  I work in a very dehydrating environment and use it either once or twice a week, depending on my schedule.  My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair mask I tried, better than Kerastaste Nutritive Masquintense &amp; Professional Expert Serie-Absolut Repair Cellular Mask and etc. I have purchased everything under sun and spare not cost because I have unhealthy and dry hair so I have always trying new product. I noticed the difference after the first use. This product was suggested by a youtube beauty channel (Missglamorazzi)</li>
            <li> First, in all fairness to my five star review you get a lot of product for the money and only need a little to cover my longish thick hair. This product really works. It has some super ingredients and I like to change around my products as my hairdresser recommended I do this so even though you can get a lower priced product as one reviewer claimed that works as well I am not sure you get a super big amount that is guaranteed to last you through many many hair conditioning sessions. This works great,,makes my hair soft and manageable and last several days. I have used many top salon products like Chi, Aveeda etc. and this holds it&#x27;s own. My daughter used the hair shampoo and that is how I found this product. I switch it around with Kheil&#x27;s Olive Hair Masque and Aveda&#x27;s  hair Masque and find this product definitely in the same class with other well known products so to those who give it less stars for the pricing I don&#x27;t agree due to the large quantity, amount needed and results. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Reading all the great reviews, I was hoping this masque could revive my dry/course hair. It didn&#x27;t. I tried three times and nothing...I will stick to Pantene Pro- V Intense treatment.....</li>
            <li> Smells really good and it leaves my hair feeling really soft. Just a great conditioner that you won&#x27;t regret trying out.</li>
            <li> Really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Feels really fresh when I use it. The exciting part everyone could notice the change</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and dry because of using iron but by using this product, now I have my healthy, soft hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  Product arrived quickly.  I have thick frizzy naturally curly hair and this conditions so well and makes my hair seem very soft.  I love that it does not need heat to condition well.  I will be buying more when this tub is out!  Seems to last long because you are only suppose to use it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and so far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thick, curly hair that I get chemically straightened every couple of months. I have mixed hair (half black, half white), so it&#x27;s more difficult to manage. But this product makes it much more manageable! Seems to keep my hair straighter and less frizzy. Just two treatments a week keep my hair nice and shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep my hair from breaking off as easily. Hopefully it helps my hair grow!</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING hair mask, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried so many different hair masks to repair my damaged hair but this one just blows them all out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I&#x27;ve dye, flat iron, blow dry my hair often so it has been physically and chemically abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick coarse strands that lost it&#x27;s shine due to too much heat styling so I desperately needed something to save my strands. Many beauty gurus have had so many good things to say about this mask so I decided to try it out with high expectations. After rinsing shampoo out of my hair, I just lather the mask on, concentrating on the ends. The first time I used it, I only left it on for 3 minutes instead of the recommended 6-7mins. I rinsed it off and immediately felt the smoothness in my hair. Then I squeezed all the water out and blow dried my hair to minimize frizz. I was amazed at the results of the hair mask as it restored some shine and smoothness of my thick strands after just one use. The second time I used it, I left it for about 10 minutes with a shower cap on so the mask can soak in a little bit more. After blowdrying, my hair was noticeably shinier and healthier. Now I use this mask about once to twice a week. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for my hair to restore it&#x27;s original state but I can say that this mask is definitely giving a huge helping hand! I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now, and still have plenty left in this giant tub. I&#x27;m thinking that this tub will last me for a long while~ it&#x27;s worth the money since the smaller 8oz tub is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that healthy hair comes from a good diet and proper hair care so don&#x27;t forget to eat and sleep well!</li>
            <li> I use this about 2x/week after my violet shampoo which REALLY dries my hair out. This stuff is a life-saver!</li>
            <li> Macadamia products are awesome! My hair is very wild, dry, and curly. I usually have to use tons of hair gel to get it in to place, but with this masque my hair looks healthy and shiny. I have always had problems brushing it, but since I started using this product my hair is manageable and I don&#x27;t have to use tons of conditioner any more!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a 16.9 oz jar almost a year ago and I use it almost everyday.  I just reordered it because it does a nice job adding extra conditioning to your hair.  It&#x27;s been highly recommended by many and I think it&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It smells great and it does a great job at making my hair really soft. I usually keep it in my hair for a couple of hours and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get great results.</li>
            <li> I have long THICK hair.  I color it, I beach it, and I have it thinned out which makes it dry and frizzy.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but OMG this stuff works wonders!!  I followed the directions but I left it in for about 10 minutes instead of 7, rinsed it out and I could feel the difference when I got out of the shower.  So soft!  I blew it out with cold air (my hair is so thick that if I let it air dry it would take literally 4 hours) and I was amazed with the results.  I have to blow dry and flat iron every time I wash or I look like a poodle.  But after I used this and used my blow drier for the first time in years I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron!!  It was so smooth and soft and laid perfectly and there is NO residue on my hair!  I highly recommend this!!  I wish I could post before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really works. I&#x27;m satisfy with the results. My hair looks healthier and feels smooth. I will definitely recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I found my holy grail masque&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soo moisturized and healthy&lt;br /&gt;My hair before was dry and damaged but this product saved my hair&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this masque! It makes my hair feel really soft and it smells good. It has helped with my hair breakage. However, I only use it once a month</li>
            <li> I purchase this once every couple of months. It smells incredible and a little REALLY goes a long way! It leave a very strong and beautiful smell in your hair, i have never gotten so many compliments! I use it for my daily conditioner and about a quarter size will do the trick! LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!!</li>
            <li> A little expensive but I love the way my hair feels now. I would recommend this to anyone with brittle or damaged hair!</li>
            <li> First off this stuff smells so good you are going to want to eat it! After one use my hair already felt stronger, looked shinier, and was so smooth.  This stuff is a must have.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair, so my hair is pretty damaged now.  I feel that leaving this treatment in my hair for 7 minutes without needing to go under the hair dryer and/or add heat is s blessing. I use it once every other week and my hair is  looking healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly so I use a straightener quite often and it dries out my ends. I read about this product and thought I would give it a try. It worked amazingly to make my hair soft and smooth. Now when I straighten my hair I no longer have  that frizz.</li>
