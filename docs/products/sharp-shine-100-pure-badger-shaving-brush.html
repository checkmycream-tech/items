            <li>when you consider the higher price badger brushes.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottom of the handle is flat so that the brush can stand on</li>
            <li>This badger brush has led me to believe that China realized if they put badger on the packaging they will sell more, not soft like my wife&#x27;s badger makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is the right size to use, with a nice solid wooden handle.</li>
