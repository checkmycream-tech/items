            <li>Love all cervave products</li>
            <li>Amazing as I did not think there was a product available that would help me.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am very happy to have found a lotion that does the the job on dry skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion recommended to me by a dermatologist...makes my skin feel very smooth and keeps eczema from coming back.</li>

            <li>Keeps your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks of using the renewing lotion, the skin on my arms and legs were smooth.</li>
            <li>and the skin is still light colored; it hasn&#x27;t darkened.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This is the best product we have tried for dry, wrinkled skin, particularly for finger tips.</li>
            <li>It does great on dry skin, as well as with bumps from shaving, etc.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry skin.</li>

            <li>Great for my psorosis &amp; sun damaged, dry skin!</li>
            <li>Great for rough and cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>I still love this product and don&#x27;t believe I lost too much of the lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite new lotion!</li>
            <li>No greasy feel and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many, many different kinds.</li>
            <li>Much better than lotions that cost 20 times more such a s Dovonex.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that CeraVe is light, non-greasy and free from a strong/overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend Cera Ve any more highly.</li>
            <li>It is really good for dry skin .</li>
            <li>She said her entire office staff uses them, and all of them had clear, beautiful skin - so we tried it.</li>
            <li>Great product, works really well on dry skin</li>
            <li>fantastic for acne, non-drying for the skin (does dry clothes), exfoliates great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is great for moisturizing, but also helps soften the effects of keratosis pilaris (those little bumps on the backs of your arms).  </li>
            <li>the foaming facial cleanser &amp; my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Applying this lotion keep my legs smooth for the whole day.</li>
            <li>But, worth it.</li>
            <li>Good on rough places on skin.</li>
            <li>and it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>WORTH the price.  </li>
            <li>I have bought liquid body soaps online similar in consistency and did not have this kind of issue.  </li>
            <li>The quality of CeraVe and the results I&#x27;ve seen from using it are worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>Just after a week I noticed a significant difference and now after 2 weeks, they are beach ready...</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Excellent lotion for dry, rough, damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far, but I need a few more weeks or a month to see how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>Amazing lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li>I like this lotion very much.  </li>
            <li>They tell you to used your moisture lotion first</li>
            <li>This feels similar but has ingredients that are more helpful for my skin.  </li>
            <li>They stopped carrying it locally, so I was glad to see I could order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose too.</li>
            <li>Great for extra dry skin.</li>
            <li>He puts it on after a shower and the bumps on his arms have pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li>This has worked better than anything I have tried for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I smoothes the skin and is very comforting.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Thicker, but found the cream is what I really needed for my scleroderma.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>It is very costly but my foot doctor uses it and that is how I heard of it.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li>Using this lotion consistently, is key to maintaining smooth skin.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>Really works for us.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft &amp; young skin.</li>
            <li>This is great for giving skin a continuing exfoliation so it looks less dry and wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly on just regular dry skin, too.</li>
            <li>As you get older your skin needs all the help it can get.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions and this is the only one that has made an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Cerave skin care products and use several different products in their line.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job restoring the skin to normal if used daily, rubbing it into the rough areas.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for all skin types</li>
            <li>The cost is a little more, but, the lotion works well.</li>
            <li>and what really surprised me, is my husband likes it much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Renewing was recommended to me by my dermatologist, in order to smooth slightly bumpy skin caused by keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>for some reason, this is the only lotion we&#x27;ve found that keeps certain break-outs from happening.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t have to clear out your wallet to get it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old and started noticing changes that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Actually, can&#x27;t say I have really seen him use lotion, but this he likes.  </li>
            <li>allot and my hands no longer itch from dryness and they are soft.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it at the doctor&#x27;s office but now find it is more convenient to order it from Amazon and in addition the price is a little less.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion to work on my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My dermo highly recommended this, and I&#x27;m a big fan now.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry skin</li>
            <li>Really helps dry and flaky skin on chin</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much that I bought it for someone who suffers from extremely dry skin.  </li>

            <li> It is very costly but my foot doctor uses it and that is how I heard of it.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li> Using this lotion consistently, is key to maintaining smooth skin.</li>

            <li> Works amazingly on just regular dry skin, too.</li>
            <li> As you get older your skin needs all the help it can get.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions and this is the only one that has made an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Cerave skin care products and use several different products in their line.</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend it for all skin types</li>

            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to clear out your wallet to get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and started noticing changes that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Actually, can&#x27;t say I have really seen him use lotion, but this he likes.  </li>
            <li> allot and my hands no longer itch from dryness and they are soft.</li>
            <li> I first purchased it at the doctor&#x27;s office but now find it is more convenient to order it from Amazon and in addition the price is a little less.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion to work on my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My dermo highly recommended this, and I&#x27;m a big fan now.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin</li>

            <li> I have hidradentitis suppurativa and as long as I use this product regularity</li>
            <li> After trying other lotions with &amp;#34;renewing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin smoothing&amp;#34; claims, I now only use CeraVe Renewing.</li>
            <li> It took about 1 week to completely eradicate the flakiness on one elbow and about a week and a half on the other elbow.</li>
            <li> and it does help my arms and legs from looking so dry.  </li>
            <li> I started using it for my uber dry skin too</li>
            <li> Ecellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Their is something about the SA that  helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry, callused skin that won&#x27;t come off, even with a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it for one area of rough dry skin</li>
            <li> Gets rid of rough, dry, bumpy patches.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dry and have tried every product ever made...</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and rough also.</li>
            <li> My children and I all have little red bumps on our arms-- and 2 of my sons have it on their faces.  </li>
            <li> The lotion simply sinks in when applied.</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> A bit greasy on the face, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my rough, bumpy skin</li>
            <li> this is the one with Salicylic Acid and is expensive, but very much worth the money if you need it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for my rough and cracked skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> Have been using it every other day since I received it</li>
            <li> Not greasy sticky or anything other than bliss.</li>
            <li> Cleared up rashes &amp; other funky looking scaly skin patches that I have had for years &amp; tried everything on them.</li>
            <li> I have frequent problems with dry skin when the weather is cold and dry.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little reading and work to get it on the phone</li>
            <li> I tried a little bit of everything -- heavy moisturizing creams, exfoliating gloves, scrubs, etc.</li>

            <li> Not sure if these were defective pump containers, or the shrink wrapping of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> It has succeeded where all others have failed to help my painfully dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a month (because I got lazy!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent lotion for dry, rough, damaged skin.  Recommended by my Dermatologist, and, I have seen a difference!  The cost is a little more, but, the lotion works well.</li>
            <li> Great  product and price is lower than local stores.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial  moisturizer  I have ever used. It was recommended by my dermatologist because I have sun damage and brown spots on my face, and they are going away!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will purchase again</li>
            <li> Product arrived well wrapped and great price for this! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Best skin cream I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with annoying (and embarrassing) dry, flaky elbows. I tried a little bit of everything -- heavy moisturizing creams, exfoliating gloves, scrubs, etc. Finally, I asked my dermatologist about it and she recommended that I try Cerave SA. She was very specific about trying the SA version. I was thrilled to find out it worked. It took about 1 week to completely eradicate the flakiness on one elbow and about a week and a half on the other elbow. It&#x27;s a God-send in the winter when my condition is the worse. Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it as a full body lotion but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied. The rest of my body responds best to heavy moisturizers. But this stuff still works like nothing else to eradicate dead skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion recommended to me by a dermatologist...makes my skin feel very smooth and keeps eczema from coming back.</li>
            <li> This is great for moisturizing, but also helps soften the effects of keratosis pilaris (those little bumps on the backs of your arms).  My dermo highly recommended this, and I&#x27;m a big fan now.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It has really helped my dry skin</li>
            <li> Very good lotion - specially in dry/hard and windy climates&lt;br /&gt;Applies in liquid/wet form and soaks into the skins in matter of seconds; depending on the climate, multiple applications are needed the &#x27;soak&#x27; the skin thoroughly prior to venturing out into the elements&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion for dry skin my dermatologist told me to use it&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!! Would highly recommend it for all skin types</li>
            <li> If you suffer from severely dry skin, you simply must try this lotion.  It has succeeded where all others have failed to help my painfully dry hands.  I can&#x27;t recommend Cera Ve any more highly.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, but I need a few more weeks or a month to see how good this stuff is. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Great product, works really well on dry skin</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I use this all of the time. Leaves my skin very soft. I&#x27;m 54 years old and started noticing changes that I didn&#x27;t like. Wonderful lotion. Use this all the time.</li>
            <li> fantastic for acne, non-drying for the skin (does dry clothes), exfoliates great for sensitive skin.  I use the soap as well, and as a combo, it is Grrreeeeaaaattt!</li>
            <li> My favorite new lotion!</li>
            <li> Takes a little reading and work to get it on the phone just right. But, worth it. Protected my screen from its fist fall in the parking lot today. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product we have tried for dry, wrinkled skin, particularly for finger tips. It works very well.</li>
            <li> I like these products since my dermatologist  told me about them.</li>
            <li> Good on rough places on skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for atopic dermatitis. It&#x27;s been a lifesaver. I saw good results in just  week.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My dermatologist recommended it for one area of rough dry skin and I started using it everywhere. It does great on dry skin, as well as with bumps from shaving, etc. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, not greasy or sticky and skin is protected.  The lotion simply sinks in when applied.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion very much.  Have been using it every other day since I received it and it does help my arms and legs from looking so dry.  They tell you to used your moisture lotion first and I tried it with moisture lotion and it was good, then I tried it without the moisture lotion and I didn&#x27;t like the way my arms and legs felt.</li>
            <li> This is excellent lotion.  I smoothes the skin and is very comforting.</li>
            <li> Best ever lotion!  Doctor recommended and I am so happy.  It really works.  APPLY twice a day and you WILL see a difference in 7 days.</li>
            <li> No real complaints. It doesn&#x27;t 100% get rid of my KP, but it works as well as any lotion I&#x27;ve used. A bit greasy on the face, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I will probably use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Thicker, but found the cream is what I really needed for my scleroderma.  Have to stick to the cream. sorry.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist to alleviate skin dryness caused by living in an arid climate. I first purchased it at the doctor&#x27;s office but now find it is more convenient to order it from Amazon and in addition the price is a little less.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave about this product enough. I have hidradentitis suppurativa and as long as I use this product regularity I don&#x27;t have breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist, to clear up rough and dry skin.  I have frequent problems with dry skin when the weather is cold and dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The SA is the best for Diabetics with skin problems. Keeps your feet smooth.Was recommended by our foot doctor He sees how well it performs on our feet.</li>
            <li> This lotion is clearing my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my rough, bumpy skin and I love it.  I can tell the difference when I forget to apply it.</li>
            <li> The doctor recommended this for my granddaughter who has a pesky skin condition.  I started using it for my uber dry skin too and it is worth the price.  Not greasy sticky or anything other than bliss.</li>
            <li> Excellent and helpful product.  This has worked better than anything I have tried for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Ecellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this product works great for me.  Prior to this the only thing I had found that didn&#x27;t make my skin read or bumpy was Cetaphil.  This feels similar but has ingredients that are more helpful for my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt when you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry and flaky skin on chin</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from someone else, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s great stuff and at a great price here!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended for my arms. They were so embarassing before I started using this product. But now I have ooh la la skin!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Great for extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to buy this and make sure it has &amp;#34;SA&amp;#34; on the front.  They stopped carrying it locally, so I was glad to see I could order it from Amazon.  I have had a lot of skin issues and they are clearing up.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this B4 I purchased; it cost less here than the pharmacy! Great for my psorosis &amp; sun damaged, dry skin! Clears up any problems after 2-3 days. Will continue to purchase &amp; would recommend whole-heartily!  A wonderful, determatologist recommended product!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, yet long lasting. Recommended by my dermatologist. Only wish it had sunscreen. Liked it and will use again.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very creamy.  The lotion effect is long lasting.  Great for rough and cracked heels.  I have recommended it to my sister and niece.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and a good price.</li>
            <li> Cleared up rashes &amp; other funky looking scaly skin patches that I have had for years &amp; tried everything on them.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for feet and hands that crack and peel or for certain types of fungus. This is like a re juvinating cream. It is very costly but my foot doctor uses it and that is how I heard of it.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has skin issues needs to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin. No greasy feel and absorbs into skin quickly. Works great for what I needed this skin lotion for. Recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love this product however, this time when my pkg came, one of the pumps were already opened in the plastic and some of the lotion oozed out of the pump.  I still love this product and don&#x27;t believe I lost too much of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended this lotion to us (husband &amp; me).  She actually sells it in her office.  Their is something about the SA that  helps dry skin. leaving it all silky.  Probably one of the better lotions I have found.  I have very dry skin and what really surprised me, is my husband likes it much as I do.  Actually, can&#x27;t say I have really seen him use lotion, but this he likes.  As you get older your skin needs all the help it can get.  And you see all these outrageously priced anti-aging creams, etc....I guess I am very happy to have found a lotion that does the the job on dry skin and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  About a dime size squirt for your face,  I like it and I have tried many, many different kinds. This one seems to make a difference.  And you don&#x27;t have to clear out your wallet to get it.</li>
            <li> WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. This- and the renewing cream.  There is nothing like these products on the market. Nothing comes close. I&#x27;m very dry and have tried every product ever made... if I had a dollar for every kind of lotion I&#x27;ve purchased...  My children and I all have little red bumps on our arms-- and 2 of my sons have it on their faces.  The dermatologist doesn&#x27;t even know what it is... but this lotion makes them almost disappear.  Works amazingly on just regular dry skin, too. WORTH the price.  Totally.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing stuff. Who knew? I use this with the foaming facial cleanser &amp; my skin looks amazing. This stuff is also great on cracked dry heels or any eczema flare ups on my hands. My face looks radiant- wrinkles are hydrated &amp; blemishes gone. Smooth, soft &amp; young skin. Pricd is amazing for the results!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is really good for dry skin . I have very dry skin and rough also. Applying this lotion keep my legs smooth for the whole day. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something more robust than Sarna. One review said it was great because it didn&#x27;t burn...it burns. I&#x27;ll stick with Sarna.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my bumpy skin</li>
            <li> great for dry skin even my freckles are fading</li>
            <li> UNREAL....It works. Much better than lotions that cost 20 times more such a s Dovonex. I have had psoriasis for 42 years and tried everything. But I have found nothing works better that the salt water and sun off the ocean!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  It helps with dry, scaly skin, and keratosis pilaris (bumps on the upper arms).  Even calluses on elbows and heels. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Both bottles were shrinked wrap together.  Upon release of the pop-up pump, cream oozed around the neck of the pump on both bottles of cream.  Not sure if these were defective pump containers, or the shrink wrapping of the bottles.  I have bought liquid body soaps online similar in consistency and did not have this kind of issue.  As to the cream, it is what I have bought at the regular drug stores.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended. All  that he said it would do.</li>
            <li> for some reason, this is the only lotion we&#x27;ve found that keeps certain break-outs from happening. this is the one with Salicylic Acid and is expensive, but very much worth the money if you need it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Recommended by my dermatologist for bumpy arms, and it has worked. But I have been impressed that it works all over, not just my arms. It has made my skin so soft and smooth. Most impressed on how well it works on my feet. Just after a week I noticed a significant difference and now after 2 weeks, they are beach ready...this is without even using a pumice stone!</li>
            <li> Instantly repaired my gardening hands like nothing before.  Not greasy, absorbs well, no scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much that I bought it for someone who suffers from extremely dry skin.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> CeraVe Renewing was recommended to me by my dermatologist, in order to smooth slightly bumpy skin caused by keratosis pilaris. Within a couple of weeks of using the renewing lotion, the skin on my arms and legs were smooth. After trying other lotions with &amp;#34;renewing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin smoothing&amp;#34; claims, I now only use CeraVe Renewing. Using this lotion consistently, is key to maintaining smooth skin. I really like the fact that CeraVe is light, non-greasy and free from a strong/overwhelming scent. The quality of CeraVe and the results I&#x27;ve seen from using it are worth the price to me. Needless to say, however, I was glad to see the value offered on Amazon for a 2 pack of CeraVe.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for keratosis pilaris that I&#x27;ve found in 11 years!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I have bruised looking skin on my big toes and it&#x27;s dry, callused skin that won&#x27;t come off, even with a pumice stone. Derm suggested I still pumice my toes and put this on twice a day. She said it would take a month or so to see the skin lighten and surprisingly it did. I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a month (because I got lazy!) and the skin is still light colored; it hasn&#x27;t darkened. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for my rough and cracked skin on my hands. It does a nice job restoring the skin to normal if used daily, rubbing it into the rough areas. Expensive, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my KP for a few days now and I can already feel a difference!  I have tried many different lotions and this is the only one that has made an improvement.  I am using it in conjunction with KP Duty on my arms and alone on my face (besides sunblock).  I recommend this for anybody who struggles with getting rid of KP.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people my Dermatologist recommended this lotion for my eczema. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin since using it. It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Cerave skin care products and use several different products in their line. This one I buy for my teenage son, who has keratosis pilaris on his upper arms. He loves this lotion! He puts it on after a shower and the bumps on his arms have pretty much disappeared. I think he is now on his 4th or 5th bottle. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but it does work (please note, however, that Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than the drugstore price). I and my son are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Absoultly love this stuff! It does exactly what its suppose too. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Love all cervave products</li>
            <li> great price for a very good product</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion to work on my extremely dry skin.  After using for two months my arms and legs are softer and have a healthier look.  Amazing as I did not think there was a product available that would help me.  I use it everyday and re-apply to my hands after washing.  I garden allot and my hands no longer itch from dryness and they are soft.</li>
            <li> This is great for giving skin a continuing exfoliation so it looks less dry and wrinkled.  I am 60+ so my legs are starting to look dry but this lotion helps a lot with keeping the skin supple.  I use on my feet too but there is a cream version of this lotion that I use on my feet now.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended my daughter try the Cera Ve products. She said her entire office staff uses them, and all of them had clear, beautiful skin - so we tried it. Now our entire family uses products from the line. They really work. No fancy scents or textures - but great results.</li>
            <li> Really works for us. Gets rid of rough, dry, bumpy patches.</li>
    </ol>
