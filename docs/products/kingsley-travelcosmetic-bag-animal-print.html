            <li>It is pretty durable, it&#x27;s NOT made from a cheap material AND who doesn&#x27;t love animal print! :</li>
            <li>its a fine makeup bag.</li>
            <li>i think I paid $8 which is fine...</li>
            <li>like this bag for my huge purse.&lt;br /&gt;This can also be used when packing for a travel.</li>
            <li>I enjOy</li>
            <li>Can fit all my makeup that i need</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy, easy to clean, lightweight, big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bag is nice sized and decent quality for how affordable it was.</li>
            <li>over-sized, easy to clean, very very well made, zipper is well-constructed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not space wise, but to open it up to get what you want.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, my daughter liked it  and took it back with her to college..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but just a tad too small.  </li>
            <li>It was as specified just seemed like it would open up a bit more.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s bigger in person, it&#x27;s more for a travel bag than make-up</li>
            <li>The photos aren&#x27;t as pretty as this really is.</li>
            <li>Great for a little visual tickle at the bottom of the tote bag.</li>
            <li>so much I got one for me.  </li>
            <li>very convenient.</li>
            <li>Until I had thrown away my older one and used this for a few days, however, I didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t stand up on its own.  </li>
            <li>its a decent size</li>
            <li>This bag Won&#x27;t fit in a small purse more for bigger purses or backpack.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li>Great for taking traveling or just keeping your make up and other small toiletries organized around the house.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, carry all my makeup in this bag, place it in my back pack, now there&#x27;s no need for a purse, when I have a class.</li>
            <li>its soft with a printed design on the material (cheetah)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice small bag for make up or other products.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the coloring in person is a little cheap looking - orangeish.</li>
            <li>While I plan to continue to use it until I need a new one, I gave it only three points, as I will never buy a bag like this again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for a little extra space, and it fits little small stuff good.</li>

            <li> This is a cute little cosmetics bag. Great for taking traveling or just keeping your make up and other small toiletries organized around the house. Makes for an excellent gift for anyone who loves animal print.</li>
            <li> This bag is amazing! it holds all of my cosmetics. It is pretty durable, it&#x27;s NOT made from a cheap material AND who doesn&#x27;t love animal print! :D&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but just a tad too small.  Not space wise, but to open it up to get what you want.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice bag that&#x27;s quality built.  I wish they just had a solid color though...I hate the animal print!</li>
            <li> It was as specified just seemed like it would open up a bit more.  Wife plans to find a use for it</li>
            <li> over-sized, easy to clean, very very well made, zipper is well-constructed.&lt;br /&gt;I like this bag for my huge purse.&lt;br /&gt;This can also be used when packing for a travel.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this for my granddaughter and like it so much I got one for me.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for my make-up and brushes.</li>
            <li> I travel bag I bought is great I bought it for my makeup and it fits it all and is stylish makeup bag  I enjOy my purchase and I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Great size, great buy! I love this makeup bag. Very good size specially if you want to carry more than your makeup in it. Love the fabric of it too ...everything always gets dirty, least with this one you can just wipe it off if  it gets dirty. Def worth the money and will be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, attractive and cost effective cosmetic bag.  I&#x27;m not one to spend $50 on a mere cosmetic bag.  Until I had thrown away my older one and used this for a few days, however, I didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t stand up on its own.  It often flops over on its side and my mascara, lipstick, pencils etc go rolling across the counter, or worse -  fall on the floor.  I do miss this feature in a bag.  While I plan to continue to use it until I need a new one, I gave it only three points, as I will never buy a bag like this again.</li>
            <li> The item was slightly larger than was anticipated. Nevertheless, my daughter liked it  and took it back with her to college..</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, carry all my makeup in this bag, place it in my back pack, now there&#x27;s no need for a purse, when I have a class. very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love the bag. Can fit all my makeup that i need</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my handbag, cute leopard design too--very affordable.  You can store a lot of items in this cosmetic pouch.</li>
            <li> The photos aren&#x27;t as pretty as this really is. Great for a little visual tickle at the bottom of the tote bag.</li>
            <li> Great item. It is exactly what i was looking for. The item was exactly what i needed. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she loves animal print, and she uses it for her makeup when she is out or to store in her purse. Still intact and doesnt seem like it will fail anytime soon. had it for about 11 months now.</li>
            <li> Made a nice gift for my boss&#x27;s birthday. She loved it and it&#x27;s right up her alley.</li>
            <li> i keep this in my purse absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> its a fine makeup bag. bought as a gift by request. its narrow not wide but tall. its soft with a printed design on the material (cheetah) i think I paid $8 which is fine...its a decent size I just don&#x27;t think its the best price. I think ulta or target even could sell a nice makeup bag with some make up included for a better deal. But if you don&#x27;t like  to shop around I do recommend it. It seems sturdy, easy to clean, lightweight, big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impartial because its not my favorite but I also didn&#x27;t pick it out nor will I be using it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and service and love it, again thanks...</li>
            <li> Great material. I love it! Best price for sure. They sell these in a few stores here and they are atleast $20..</li>
            <li> this product is perfect. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice small bag for make up or other products.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars, because I love animal print.  But it&#x27;s bigger in person, it&#x27;s more for a travel bag than make-up</li>
