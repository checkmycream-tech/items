            <li>This is an excellent shampoo, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>No, it won&#x27;t make your hair so perfect that you don&#x27;t need a styling tool, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to do that.</li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>the best.</li>
            <li>Product makes hair smell wonderful but it made my hair fall out ALOT.</li>

            <li>and I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>Smelled great worked well.</li>
            <li>great after I go swimming, to get the salt and chlorine out of my hair.</li>
            <li>That was until I woke up with the driest, itchiest scalp I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>as a shampoo, it works great.</li>
            <li>It smelled great and made my hair silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the bottle, I can tell that it smells great.</li>
            <li>was really great.  </li>
            <li>My scalp and hair felt great.</li>
            <li>and it smells great.</li>
            <li>All in all a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, I never had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love great hair products and this one is definitely great.</li>
            <li>But the good news- I have started paying close attention to the products and chemicals I put on my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is superior.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and leaves a \\&quot;just-right\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li>The result has been good hair days again.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this product from the day I bought it:</li>
            <li>I loved the product when I bought it.</li>
            <li>My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  </li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t do my hair or scalp much good.  </li>
            <li>It feels silkier (NOT oily) and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I started using this and loved it</li>
            <li>because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say a good 1/4 of the bottle was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was hopeful that it would also be a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got compliments from my husband after that it smelled good</li>
            <li>and it did smell good for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked, it cleaned my hair, it rinsed fairly well, it didn&#x27;t have an offensive odor, and there isn&#x27;t a lot else to say.  </li>
            <li>all were good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the feeling it gave my hair - nourished, just like the package promises.</li>
            <li>So, unless you are making your own or buying pricey health food store purist products, you will find this product attractive and not at all objectionable.</li>
            <li>you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.</li>
            <li>a range of shampoos and conditioners that feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the comments very interesting.  </li>
            <li>I was horrified that many people experienced hair loss and some had rashes.  </li>
            <li>Like many others, I experienced severe itchiness from using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I first used this it was great!  </li>
            <li>My first thoughts about this product were that is smells AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair felt thinner and could feel more of my scalp!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Please...if you love your hair, don&#x27;t use this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my hair after using the product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>(I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li>I noticed the smell was pleasant even though I was sure it was a chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I liked the shampoo but the packaging needs a bit of work.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>, liked the fact that it does have an hydrolyzed animal protein.</li>
            <li>So I must be honest</li>
            <li>I have honestly been losing alot if hair</li>
            <li>Nice and styled curls that were bouncey.</li>
            <li>Nice to touch and comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice and lathers well</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of Pantene Pro V or Pert Plus.</li>
            <li>I am the kind of person who reads the ingredients list of EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>Even if I liked the product a lot, the bottle design will keep me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>It is with great sadness that I say that these reviews of hair loss are true.</li>
            <li>Also contains the laurel this and laurel that are are used for cleaning garage floors, so the soap part is very strong.  </li>
            <li>I shouldnt have to worry about becoming bald!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about how healthy my hair looks,and I love it!</li>
            <li>At first I loved it!</li>
            <li>IT BETTER WORK! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks to Clear, my hair is so much more manageable, smells delicious, and my scalp feels great!</li>
            <li>Ingredients in this product isn&#x27;t suitable for the hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you want your hair to look, feel, and smell fantastic, but in a way that cannot be good for it...</li>
            <li>, great things rarely come with a price tag of $4...</li>
            <li>But after just three weeks of using this product I have a fist full of hair in my hand after I shower!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been washing and perming my own hair for 45 years &amp; African Pride is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li>Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice, and plumped up my hair for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece).</li>
            <li>For normal hair people it should be wonderful, but for me it is worth it because it gets rid of the dandruff!</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if all these things stop happening.</li>
            <li>this many people could not be making this up.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use the product for 3 days.</li>
            <li>My hair is now more gray than brown and is getting a courser texture.</li>
            <li>The flip-open top on the shampoo bottle cannot be sealed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t noticed the thinning hair issue as many others have posted</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of weeks and no problem my hair smelled lovely</li>
            <li>I contacted the company as I think this product should be pulled off the shelf with so many people having these issues.</li>
            <li>This is an economical shampoo, with good results.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the drug store one day when I noticed the prominent display.</li>
            <li>Many people are allergic to sulfates and they don&#x27;t even know it.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the fancy award winning products do not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I love Biolage but can&#x27;t always afford it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this on a whim and after a couple months I&#x27;ve been really pleased.</li>
            <li>My hair was softer, shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li>but I should have known better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting better (the rash)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like a conditioner ..</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I came here to give a rave review about how I love this shampoo and it smwlla</li>
            <li>Although now that I think about it I have been losing more than I ever remember.</li>
            <li>Even my hair stylist would remark every time she cut it how amazingly healthy my hair was.  </li>
            <li>Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the conditioner that goes with this.</li>
            <li>That makes me the most upset.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask?</li>
            <li>The labeling is misleading, as it proclaims that it will \\&quot;nourish the scalp\\&quot; and more.</li>
            <li>It felt like the texture of my hair changed for the better.</li>
            <li>With this product, I think I&#x27;ll be able to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>but it makes sense that a healthy scalp will support healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li>Most products have them.</li>
            <li>It took a while (many months) to figure out that it was this shampoo/conditioner brand.</li>
            <li>more so, that I&#x27;ve been doing it to myself...</li>
            <li>this happened to so many of you as well.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>More like the POISONS.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>just one more thing.</li>
            <li>I immediately felt better.  </li>
            <li>I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with.</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li>And I liked the clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Great smelling producting, decent at cleansing.  </li>
            <li>This product is deceiving; at first I loved it, but over many months, it ruined my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>After looking online and at these reviews, I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s this product because I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction to any kind of product ever in my life!</li>
            <li>At first I truly loved this product.</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by the pretty scent and the pretty light color of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using the long lengths for almost two months and still have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>At first I too loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and to be quite honest, I rarely am.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Nourishing shampoo, I thought this would be my new best friend.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are impressive for a conventional shampoo since a lot of healthy ones are included.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed so far.</li>
            <li>At first, Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty shampoo and conditioner seemed to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Soft, silky hair and great smell.</li>
            <li>almost immediately  after washing i can see my scalp literally  drying up and becoming flaking within minutes.</li>
            <li>really thought it might be good from the smell</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this shampoo, and wanted it to be awesome, but within a couple of days, I began noticing my scalp was super tender, like it had little cuts or something, and I was losing tons of hair, like I have never seen, even when I was pregnant years ago</li>
            <li>(couldn&#x27;t comb through it easily), so I didn&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li>When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I have easily lost over 50% of the hair at my crown.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product because some members of our family have easily irritated scalps.  </li>
            <li>Strong lingering fragrance which doesn&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
            <li>The chemicals are too strong in the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this product, I thought it was amazing</li>
            <li>Am hoping this will end soon as I only used this twice..extremely traumatizing, I had beautiful hair before this happened..</li>
            <li>At first, I liked the product, but within two weeks, I started losing handfuls of hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product at first, but then my hair started falling out (A LOT).</li>
            <li>I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, light and healthy all day.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the great smell of lilacs, not too strong but very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Clinically proven to help restore scalp&#x27;s natural moisture balance to create the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gently cleanses &amp; nourishes scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>In the shower it was fine-</li>
            <li>My scalp seems fine, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, but lots of it.</li>
            <li>As I continued using it, my hair felt dirtier and oilier more quickly, and my scalp began to itch.</li>
            <li>I am paying a huge amount of money for medications.</li>
            <li>my hair started falling out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li>(smelled fantastic and made</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the nourishment of the scalp, but I do know that it leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic and they leave my hair smelling fantastic for over a day.</li>
            <li>This product provides a light cleansing and does not leave a build-up.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I received some coupons from the company to get two free bottles.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Saw all of the reviews on here, and it confirmed my suspicions.</li>
            <li>Blood work came back great.</li>
            <li>These products are excellent in the fact that I didn&#x27;t have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  </li>
            <li>I got this for free through shespeaks and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth hair.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will stop I really enjoy having hair.</li>
            <li>I actually thought my hair felt great</li>
            <li>/&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and has completely cleared up my chronic dandruff.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product for right now.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are water and the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate, plus a nice variety of oils including sunflower and coconut</li>
            <li>DO NOT purchase ANY of the Clear shampoo or conditioners!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner has also thinned my hair out significantly from all the hair loss.  </li>
            <li>first several times I used this shampoo I loved it!</li>
            <li>Not patches, just gradual and in significant amounts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to use this because Allure Magazine rated it the &amp;#34;Best Shampoo&amp;#34; for 2012.</li>
            <li>ot there it certainly isn&#x27;t worth the risk!</li>
            <li>About 6 months ago, I noticed that I was losing a significant amount of hair at the crown of my head and along my hairline.  </li>
            <li>I used a trial sample tonight, and significant amount of hair fell off from my scalp in the shower.</li>
            <li>First off I love the scent.</li>
            <li>whereas Pantene&#x27;s long hair formula (great lengths) cannot even compare.</li>
            <li>After the first wash, I noticed that my hair was more shiny and softer.</li>
            <li>the smell is delicious and my hair hasn&#x27;t been falling out ( just the usual).</li>
            <li>honestly cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it made it feel really clean.</li>
            <li>and I have been MUCH more satisfied than with the Clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like this in that it leaves my scalp feeling clean without that tingly feeling you get with some dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I reviewed Clear conditioner recently, and was very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s clean, it looks and feels greasy</li>
            <li>my ends seem to look pretty full and healthy to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Discover the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair with new Clear scalp and hair beauty therapy</li>
            <li>This shampoo only gives me one day of good looking, clean hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and shiny, and it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it one night and it left my hair very silky and smooth, and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li>I was finding everywhere, do laudry and the lint trap would be full of the hair that was on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed my scalp with the shower head for like 15-20 full minutes to no avail</li>
            <li>Yes, Clear does lather nicely.  </li>
            <li>A good shampoo that cleans and protects your hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found a lot of information online about sulfate-free shampoos, which are more gentle than the majority of shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>I used Clear shampoo and the conditioner and for months i used it because i liked how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li>I received some samples of it and used them while traveling and loved the way it made my hair look and feel, so I switched and began using it daily.  </li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly, but leaves my hair both soft and manageable, with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>I did try the one specifically for dandruff but those results weren&#x27;t as good as the regular formula.</li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely looks good from the packaging</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I washed my sister&#x27;s hair with it</li>
            <li>Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling</li>
            <li>This is a very nice shampoo, it leaves your hair clean and feeling moist even when wet.</li>
            <li>the smell does not linger after rinsing out, but I&#x27;d rather use something a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so fresh and CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it&#x27;s just a LIE.  </li>
            <li>If this product does not fade my color quickly I will write another review and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>not all hundreds of complaints are just super senstive to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try some argan oil shampoo to try to quickly fix this problem, and will never use this shampoo/conditioner again.</li>
            <li>My hair has came out tremendously.</li>
            <li>From the first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed a HUGE difference in my scalp and hair after first use.  </li>
            <li>Since all blood work was normal, I feel confident I have diagnosed the problem</li>
            <li>When i first bought this shampoo, it was because i had a coupon for buy one and get one free.</li>
            <li>The internet is full of useful information, so why not use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, for the first time in my life the ends are just about reaching to the waistband of my pants :)  When my hair gets down to my butt, I will go to the salon and give it a good trim -</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner felt instantly soothing when I put it on, which was nice, and my scalp feels really clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was appealing with it&#x27;s fresh smell and decent price point.</li>
            <li>but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>This is not my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>so great until I read through previous reviews where people are saying it is making their hair fall out.</li>
            <li>Your hair is not actually absorbing nutrients from your scalp, pleasant as that idea may be.</li>
            <li>I do have highlighted hair but pretty damn healthy thanks to joico and redeken.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>First, I will say I have NEVER, EVER written a review of any product in my life!  </li>
            <li>Really!?!</li>
            <li>I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, completely unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this shampoo was great because it made my hair soft and made it easy for me to comb through my long hair, but while in the shower and running the conditioner through my hair, clumps of hair would end up in my hands.</li>
            <li>many other reviewers, at first I thought I really liked the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Very soft and very clean.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely happy and have told everyone I know about it and the few that have tried it also substantial differences in there hair and</li>
            <li>so I figured these were worth a try.  </li>
            <li>However, the Clear shampoo did much more.</li>
            <li>As befits a Unilever product it is solid, the opening and closing of the dispenser is smooth and it feels good to hold since it was probably contoured to fit the human hand.</li>
            <li>It works I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It does a great job for me, and I double the effect by using it along with the Clear conditioner.  </li>
            <li>i love this product so far.</li>
            <li>but i won&#x27;t  stop using it because so far  I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped  washing my hair with  hot water (still enjoy my hot showers)</li>
            <li>At first I liked it and had no issues, then I began to notice more hair in and around my sink, on my pillow, on my desk, in the shower and after a couple of weeks my hair line thinned, and my hair felt super limp.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, so when I let this air dry and my slightly wavy hair turned out with perfect waves and was so smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and my hair feels so soft after using.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a chance a few months ago and actually liked it at first (mostly because of the smell).</li>
            <li>and I said to myself &#x27;something isnt right here&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in shock, the culprit was right in front of me.  </li>
            <li>It seems like all the shampoos out there right now are so moisturizing that they make your hair greasy right away.  </li>
            <li>And while this shampoo didn&#x27;t change that exactly, it did seem to make my hair softer and thus more tractable after about three or four washes with the Clear Scalp conditioner.  </li>
            <li>At first I was IN LOVE with Clear.</li>
            <li>My boss would tease me and say &amp;#34;you shedding&amp;#34; i laughed and brushed it off as normal.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  </li>
            <li>Many of the ingredients are natural and they rinse clean and leave your hair manageable, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more gentle and natural product.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li>I know immediately after the first wash if my hair is going to like a shampoo or not, given that I have slightly wavy hair that needs a good blow out or</li>
            <li>gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch out my shampoo to a new one after this bottle was gone and literally after the first use of the new shampoo my head stopped itching and i am already feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li>This was the first thing that I noticed immediately.  </li>
            <li>It was coming out consistently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten like three compliments just this week on how shiny and pretty</li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t even aware of it until she showed me with a mirror.  </li>
            <li>After using this product , it never failed that I would get acne of my scalp.and</li>
            <li>I should have come here to read these reviews first when the hair loss began since I thought it was something else.  </li>
            <li>I will be definitely purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>Simply put, when I wake up these days, my hair looks pretty respectable and all I have to do is brush it and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny reading all the reviews that say their hair was falling out.  </li>
            <li>many others, I have been to 2 doctors and had numerous blood test done to see what may have been wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This review is mostly the same as the one for its sister product, Volumizing Root Boost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Used this 2 times first week of July.  </li>
            <li>the same thing has been happening to many users.</li>
            <li>With this many complaints of the same issue, at some point don&#x27;t you think that they might say \\&quot;hmmm...</li>
            <li>I first purchased this shampoo because it was on sale, and based on the television ads.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the breakage first and quit using the product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked and it was very embarrassing!</li>
            <li>no so much!</li>
            <li>It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...</li>
            <li>Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...</li>
            <li>So what exactly are the benefits of the shampoo alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product definitely gives great results but I object to the long list of chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li>I simply love it and cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li>I washed me hair 2 more times with a different shampoo to relieve the pain which helped a bit.</li>
            <li>I first saw this shampoo at Walmart.</li>
            <li>i am on my second wash and i absolutely  love  </li>
            <li>on my  readings hot water for your scalp is a no no.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I felt like my head was in a fog.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well</li>
            <li>The shampoo is OK but the fragrance is a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>Though I can&#x27;t say much for the conditioner because I only use it on my ends (a fine hair tip - don&#x27;t condition your scalp!)</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter had been using it as well, and has had a significant amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>So I bought the travel size bottles of the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner and so far I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li>they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li>I have used Wen and find this is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>my hair super soft)...</li>
            <li>The only person who could easily get anything out of them is someone with hands like King Kong.</li>
            <li>and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing to be able to use less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They assumed it was most likely a normal change for my age (29) or just stress and that it should pass...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair falling out in large clumps.</li>
            <li>Pure poison.  </li>
            <li>I probably would not write to persons I know endorsing it but would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Aveeno&#x27;s Pure Renewal Sulfate-Free shampoo</li>
            <li>But when people at work started picking hair off my clothes, I started noticing my hair was falling out in large quantities.</li>
            <li>Id say that is quite a large reason to stop buying it.</li>
            <li>I eventually noticed I was losing more hair than normal and really started to worry because I could finally see/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found two excellent and MUCH less harsh shampoos</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that tends to get frizzy (with coarse gray hairs as well).</li>
            <li>But based on other reviews, I&#x27;m glad I threw this away after the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li>I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing</li>
            <li>To top it all off, I then developed a rash like dematitis in my head with little pus filled bumps.</li>
            <li>Not only did this product make me think that I had lice because I was itching so much, it also made my hair fall out in huge clumps.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I tried not to think much of it</li>
            <li>(jump up and run really)</li>
            <li>I received the Total Care Nourishing and the Damage and Color Repair shampoos and conditioners for free</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very creamy feel.</li>
            <li>It was a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>It was really upsetting</li>
            <li>Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>yet it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a week, and SO MUCH HAIR LOSS.</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle also leaves much to be desired....</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, went back to wash my hair again with Castille soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) because there was a 6 foot radius of smelly floral (cheap) scent surrounding</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample locally and tossed it after one try.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is very itchy as well.</li>
            <li>My hair turned shiny and very manageable, almost immediately after beginning its use.</li>
            <li>But now my hair has thinned so much that i see my scalp</li>
            <li>I USE to HAVE Tons of Hair; people were jealous at how much hair I had but NOT so much now.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t need much shampoo or much from a shampoo, and this bottle lasted a while.</li>
            <li>This really foams up as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It really does a thourough cleaning job of the scalp without stripping the hair of moisture.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Omg I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is shedding so much</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any of the problems others complain about, and it does a great job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>It started feeling thinner, not curling nearly as much as it used to, gets oily a lot faster... and its falling out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem like it really cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li>I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li>It also gave me a very irritated scalp and sores.</li>
            <li>Your results after stopping use are greatly appreciated...</li>
            <li>and I could not figure out why y hair was shedding so much.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon review for scaring the s</li>
            <li>I NEVER take the time out to write reviews for any product I purchase, but this has really changed my hair.</li>
            <li>keep in mind, i have lots of hair, very curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They said this was unusual...</li>
            <li>I have a very oily, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair would come out in many strands in the shower and was enough to completely cover and clog the drain each time.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried the Clear products &amp; have since bought them at my local store.</li>
            <li>but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched.</li>
            <li>I found it made a real different in how my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair felt and was able to be managed, so I was eager to try Clear shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love my new long, thicker and shiny hair</li>
            <li>clear scalp and hair therapy shampoo was!!!  </li>
            <li>have thick hair that pretty much has a life of its own.  </li>
            <li>You may be one of the users that doesn&#x27;t have an issue, but with so many other products</li>
            <li>It was all normal!</li>
            <li>I received this through the Vine Voices program and was really excited about the prospect of a shampoo that would possibly take care of my scalp too.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, this product made my hair fall out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I have long, but fine hair</li>
            <li>It also left my hair very shiney and full of life.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly think my hair shone much with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and fairly long.  </li>
            <li>Not sure, but hope that the makers of this product continue to supply us, that have had great results, with further hair care lines.  </li>
            <li>If you were to have dry hair or very thick hair, this shampoo should be wonderful for you.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is more viscous than other shampoos, so I was able to use less; this shampoo did leave my hair wetter longer after showering, noticeably so; that&#x27;s is, though.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use the shampoo in conjunction with the corresponding conditioner that I am able to easily pass a comb thru my wet hair, which is not the case at all with other products.</li>
            <li>I obviously discontinued use, but she said it will take a month to see a full improvement.</li>
            <li>I would be interested in a class action lawsuit.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing the full size bottles.</li>
            <li>This product also made the skin around my scalp, neck, and shoulders feel really difference than normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every shampoo/conditioner under the sun, and this is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li>My hair has been color treated and tends to be very fine and limp.  </li>
            <li>NEW!</li>
            <li>and I sometimes like trying new things that look promising.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it and attributed it to stress from a new job.</li>
            <li>When dry, my hair looks, feels, and smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>This shampoo helped my hair a ton and it finally started growing back, its now shiny, not frizzy, looks a million times better.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of lathering and</li>
            <li>I recently started using this shampoo and started noticing a tremendous amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>but I suspect that now, since they often include some sort of botanical essence or extract in so many products, that some sort of essential oil, possibly lavendar oil, may be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, let me say I only actually used this once.  </li>
            <li>*** out of me, except for a decent amount of volume, shine, and length contribution.</li>
            <li>I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>i suffer from very itchy dry scalp and dandruff (mostly in the front and middle of my scalp).</li>
            <li>100% certain Clear products are to blame.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I have quit using this shampoo for almost one week and have noticed a little bit of a difference in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing, but I&#x27;m sure it will take time.  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s worked for me! !</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon Vine for bringing Clear into my life.....</li>
            <li>This product seemed to clear the oil from my hair very well, and made it manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because of Clear that my hair is so long - it smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li>CLEAR shampoo and conditioner  really does focus on giving  your scalp the therapy  </li>
            <li>All results normal.  </li>
            <li>My colored hair(which is normally shiny and sleek)</li>
            <li>Bummer there are so many harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I switched to wen after my first flare, because it was natural, but even some of the natural ingredients caused me issues.  </li>
            <li>always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even mentioned that my hair was thinner and drier than normal.  </li>
            <li>All was normal, but my hair kept falling out.</li>
            <li>I started using the Clear Shampoo and Conditioner about 2 years ago, YES 2 yrs, that&#x27;s how much hair I had so much that it took nearly a year for me to notice that I was loosing my hair.</li>
            <li>I too went to doctors; 2 in fact, had blood work done, came out normal.</li>
            <li>My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal thickness after throwing this rat poison in the trash?  </li>
            <li>Iron and ferritin completely normal.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in no way prone to headaches, only if I have a rare hangover).  </li>
            <li>I am over it and won&#x27;t pass it along to a friend like I normally do because it seems this system has something fishy going on with it.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy anymore and with the onset of gray hair I have noticed the texture of my hair changing to a more coarser feel.</li>
            <li>I started using this product in April of 2014 and looking back, I didn&#x27;t really notice any issues for the first 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>My psoriasis came back in full force and I&#x27;ve lost nearly all my hair.</li>
            <li>There should be a Class Action Lawsuit against the manufacturer of the Clear Brand!!!</li>
            <li>I was given good size samples of this shampoo and conditioner at my local supermarket the other day and tried them the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27yo female, and I feel like my 60yo dad right now.</li>
            <li>Looking for answers, on a long shot I looked up Clear shampoo reviews since that was one thing that had changed leading up to the significant hair loss.  </li>
            <li>The containers are way too large, you can&#x27;t &#x27;squeeze&#x27; them because it&#x27;s a hard plastic, and you can&#x27;t unscrew the top because it isn&#x27;t made that way.</li>
            <li>In the last 6 months, large patches of my hair started getting really coarse/wiry.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Shampoo might actually live up to its advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to try new things</li>
            <li>Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I had neither the problems that others have had nor any particular benefits other than clean hair that any shampoo could deliver.</li>
            <li>I switch between the long lengths and total care to keep my hair from becoming ammune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>a flat iron run through to limit frizz, I was surprised as how much the shampoo tamed all of that without the need for hot tools.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair very natural.</li>
            <li>so thankful for these amazon reviewers that lead me to the conclusion that Clear hair products will make your hair fall out!</li>
            <li>I urge whomever is reading this to please not buy any Clear hair products!</li>
            <li>After 3 shampoos my head was the completely clear!</li>
            <li>They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li>NOT WITH CLEAR!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, that all lasted only for that first week.</li>
            <li>First of all, the massive hair loss and breakage I had has stopped.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my hair still gets pretty oily the day after washing so it hasn&#x27;t helped with that.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from these products!</li>
            <li>I also started to notice that my hair was falling out more than usual</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty basic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li>this product so far!.</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way which is certainly nice for the pocketbook.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought three bottles so far, which is a lot for a compulsive tester of new products.</li>
            <li>At first, the shampoo left my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I really hope that it goes back to normal soon.</li>
            <li>Thinking back, I was noticing more hair coming out in the shower because I had to start keeping it from going down the drain.  </li>
            <li>That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the positive reviews are from people who just starting using this.</li>
            <li>Secondly, my plaques are not nearly as heavy as normal, and I don&#x27;t have as much itching.  </li>
            <li>When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day.</li>
            <li>noticed no difference on my scalp, so overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone concerned with lack of hair volume or who wants to have shiny, soft hair!</li>
            <li>I started using this last year some time and have noticed that my hair has been falling out in large clumps.  </li>
            <li>My hair is already fine so losing more really stinks.</li>
            <li>Clear shampoo needs to be removed from the market permanently, because it&#x27;s truly a rip off.  </li>
            <li>if I hadn&#x27;t thrown the Clear in the trash who knows how much hair I would have left?</li>
            <li>and that is when I started to look up reviews for the Clear Scalp and Therapy shampoo line.  </li>
            <li>Not with this Clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have less of this item to clean each month.</li>
            <li>Clear shampoo claims to nourish your scalp and thereby your hair.</li>
            <li>So, I went to the store and switched to the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy:</li>
            <li>rate \\&quot;CLEAR</li>
            <li>I will be a permanent CLEAR user from now on.  </li>
            <li>I used the Clear Scalp and Hair therapy shampoo and conditioner every two days before, but now I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner every time.  </li>
            <li>use tea tree oil at night and then in the morning I washed my hair with clear shampoo and apply Clear conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t click that Clear was the source of my hair loss until I realized that as soon as I stopped using it</li>
            <li>I am going to stop using clear and see if the hair loss remains.</li>
            <li>I had been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for about a year.</li>
            <li>I received the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty nourishing shampoo and have been using it as needed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using Clear for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for over a year.</li>
            <li>I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>I will never use another product from the Clear line.</li>
            <li>Then I found Clear.</li>
            <li>Clear has literally transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I have been losing so much hair that I have to clear the drain twice while I shower.</li>
            <li>clear needs to be taken off the shelves</li>
            <li>Had red welts on scalp that were very itchy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now with no breakage since discontinuing Clear shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing.</li>
            <li>When I would brush it the brush was completely covered with hair and during the day I would run my fingers through my hair and get a TON of strands.  </li>
            <li>I am guessing also became sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I was staying at a hotel</li>
            <li>I now have completely damaged scalp and about 50% of the amount of hair</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used the shampoo only once, I can&#x27;t tell if it will improve the condition of my scalp as much as it has my hair, but I am eager to discover the effect there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have grey hairs that I color frequently because I&#x27;m pretty young, (25)</li>
            <li>As I am about to turn 59, I doubt I will ever have the opportunity to have long pretty hair again.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started with this product my scalp has completely healed.</li>
            <li>It makes my  damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li>I really hope my hair bounces back!</li>
            <li>I naturally thought it was my Metformin medications.</li>
            <li>I can no longer wear my hair up or in a ponytail because when I pull it back it shows so much scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to some of the products they use there.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shinier than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>When I saw my 20 year old son&#x27;s hair getting thinner</li>
            <li>It both lathers well and rinses out completely.</li>
            <li>After using this about a month, the texture of my hair had completely changed.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that my hair was soft, even after just shampooing before conditioning</li>
            <li>I tend to get allergic reactions to products, but not this one so far.</li>
            <li>and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time.</li>
            <li>I do not have a sensitive scalp...</li>
            <li>In early November, I started using Clear.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was much thinner and starting to look sparse in some areas and a couple of days ago, (jan18)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have especially problematic hair, I keep it short, and there is no artificial coloring to worry about.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line and the shine/scalp improvement I get by using it, but alas, I cannot spend as much as I used to on haircare.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever dye my hair but in addition to all this, I noticed many strands seem to be losing some of their natural pigment - not drastic color loss like graying, but the pigment in each individual strand has become uneven.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is now ultra thick and so healthy.  </li>
            <li>if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li>Finally after realizing it was the shampoo mostly ( I used them as a test) causing the problems I goggled it and saw all the other complaints same as mine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any more breakage than I have in the past, and I definitely have not experienced my hair falling out in clumps as some other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li>My usual shampoo cleans my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  </li>
            <li>a serious research of this shampoo ingredients I read that zinc helps to stop help lost and in in most cases help to regrowth</li>
            <li>well after many serious reviews and complaints I will be immediately throwing this garbage where it belongs.</li>
            <li>I usually like them, but not enough to go out of my way to buy/request more of.</li>
            <li>In the past I have also not been able to use the same shampoo brand for an extended period of time for some reason.</li>
            <li>I was a little reluctant to buy the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>The neck rash took a week of applying cream and being diligent about keeping the area dry and washing with gentle soap for it to clear.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair, an oily scalp at the top and a dry scalp at the base of my head...</li>
            <li>But how long will it take for my very irritated scalp to go back to normal??  </li>
            <li>Just add me to the long list of people who have had hair loss thanks to this product, I had no idea it was my shampoo.</li>
            <li>First it changed the texture of my hair to a rather rough texture.  </li>
            <li>Since the whole premise behind this product line is scalp health, and I obviously don&#x27;t have a healthy one, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>but all my tests came back normal.</li>
            <li>Thyroid tests came back completely normal.</li>
            <li>Ditched the shampoo and all was back to normal.</li>
            <li>I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li>and they ran a bunch of tests which all came back normal.</li>
            <li>This is the only new product I was using.</li>
            <li>I have only used my new shampoo for two days.  </li>
            <li>Very upset &amp; very embarrassed that my hair was missing around the edges.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, I had fine, thin hair to begin with and didn&#x27;t have this kind of hair to lose!  </li>
            <li>My hairline (especially around my temples) has thinned so much you can see my white scalp.</li>
            <li>I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years</li>
            <li>The shampoo was delivered to me in a box containing no other items.</li>
            <li>did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use....</li>
            <li>I have very wavy and frizzy hair, and this has really helped to tame it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li>, lathers easily (even in hard water) &amp; the conditioner makes my hair soft &amp; I can actually get a comb thru it.</li>
            <li>I normally have fine but very thick blond hair, and now my scalp was showing a LOT around my part and all around the crown.  </li>
            <li>So here I am, a lovely shade of golden blonde - buying expensive hair shampoo after hair shampoo only to decide on Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty on a whim, shortly after seeing it&#x27;s name in Allure magazine.</li>
            <li>Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>Formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C &amp; E, sunflower, almond, soybean &amp; coconut oils &amp; aloe</li>
            <li>Generally, unless I use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;agree\\&quot; with it, my hair looks and behaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use shampoo, of course, but I generally buy whatever&#x27;s cheapest.</li>
            <li>I bought the Clear brand shampoo I bought two different kinds of it.  </li>
            <li>Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Total Care for All Hair Types.</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care</li>
            <li>I stopped use of Clear and went back to Herbal Essence (never had a problem with this shampoo) and the strands stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>Shortly after stopping this and the Clear Conditioner, my head stopped itching and my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore.</li>
            <li>In short, steer clear of these products.</li>
            <li>I stopped using Clear and went back to Pantene and Jhirmack.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using the Clear Total Care Shampoo and Conditioner for 6 months now, and she raves about it!  </li>
            <li>Everytime I see the Clear commercial, I want to punch Heidi Klum in the face!</li>
            <li>However, it did appear greasy once again, so I switched back to Clear.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed healthier scalp, so I figured I&#x27;d try Clear, since it was inexpensive enough.</li>
            <li>Within hours I had blisters on my hands and a scalp weeping clear fluid.</li>
            <li>read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li>I switched to African Pride 2-1 shampoo conditioner &amp; to my amazement my hair made a complete recovery.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and fluid.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was milder and left my scalp as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as conversant with the chemicals in this product</li>
            <li>My scalp itched and developed tiny scabs, as another commenter reported.</li>
            <li>it feels like straight shampoo, not much in suds ..</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and am about to complete my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will release some corresponding styling products in the near future.</li>
            <li>As far as the rest of the consumers that are having opposite effects, sounds as if it is an allergic reaction to an ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look up the reviews on this brand and noticed so many people, approximately 75% were complaining of hair loss.</li>
            <li>conditioner feels thick and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very reminiscent of the original herbal essences shampoo only a little softer.</li>
            <li>After the second use, my gray hair no longer seemed coarse but had the same texture as the rest of my hair - it feels almost as soft as my 3 year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that other one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight.</li>
            <li>I also have psoriasis and a very reactive scalp so my hair routine was an endless cycle of: coloring hair -&gt; irritated scalp.</li>
            <li>I think this is due to having been moisturized too much by the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing really \\&quot;wow\\&quot; about the product compared to all the other types I&#x27;ve tried and used.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it is normal to lose 50 or even 100 hairs a day, so this was hard to notice at first.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B007RTR898 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>i recently purchased a big jug of both  clear  shampoo and the conditioner at BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Then the second time, I developed a rash on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am particularly sensitive, but it seems like several customers have had the same problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently switched a couple of months back to the natural Herbal Essence line with no parabens and noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going back to regular old anti-dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Like I said earlier, this has been the ONLY product that I have used that ever completely cleared my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am African American with relaxed hair, but I am transitioning to natural</li>
            <li>So she made me go write a good review because she&#x27;s afraid they&#x27;ll stop making this shampoo for her to buy if they only listened to the complainers.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair short thinking that it would get better and it just got worse.</li>
            <li>Long list of chemicals that no one needs near their skin.  </li>
            <li>Like so many of the previous reviewers, this shampoo was VERY harsh and had adverse effects.</li>
            <li>After I used this, it left my hair quite greasy looking even though I had spent a decent amount of time rinsing my hair after washing.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are a real let down.</li>
            <li>First, the bottle indicates that the scalp benefits are only indicated when the conditioner is also used, so I bet the shampoo does little or nothing to help your scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very long and fine, but thick.</li>
            <li>I paid $50 for my hair to be checked by a professional lice checking company, just to find out that I did not have lice but that my scalp was ridiculously dry and to change my shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used to have soft, shiny hair, but now it&#x27;s dry with a hint of grease or something.</li>
            <li>I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc</li>
            <li>Combing through my hair when wet resulted in a comb FULL of hair and once dried and styled, there were still strands falling all over the house and sticking to my clothes...</li>
            <li>I had hair loss, but it&#x27;s possible I lost a little more than usual.</li>
            <li>He had the most beautiful thick hair and now I FEEL TERRIBLE GUILT OVER BUYING THIS SHAMPOO!!!</li>
            <li>However, within a few weeks of regular use, I started to notice some redness and itchiness in my scalp and also MUCH more hair falling out than usual.</li>
            <li>prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry and curl the ends later.  </li>
            <li>I had to use a clarifying shampoo several days in a row to wash out whatever residue that stuff had left that had really weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Again, I have really fine hair, so I definitely don&#x27;t need a product meant to wash, leave a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li>This is why customer reviews are so important as opposed to the opinion of one magazine or one &amp;#34;expert.&amp;#34; I hope this helps out anyone considering to purchase this shampoo so that you do not have to go through the trouble of repairing your scalp and hair from this harsh product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discovering the ugly truth about this shampoo, I threw it away and started searching for a gentle shampoo to make my hair and scalp healthy again.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, you will greatly regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I have written to Amazon saying a bubble envelope may not be the best way to ship this</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best drug store shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great addition to my hair care regimen!  </li>
            <li> I am a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.  </li>
            <li> Smells awesome and is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect now.</li>
            <li> The best I have used.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been my best feature</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> No, it won&#x27;t make your hair so perfect that you don&#x27;t need a styling tool, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to do that.</li>
            <li> It is great!</li>
            <li> the best.</li>
            <li> Product makes hair smell wonderful but it made my hair fall out ALOT.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been one of my best features, and believe me, as one ages one is thankful to retain whatever good features one has!</li>
            <li> It smelled great, my hair was manageable, it curled perfectly.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled so good!</li>
            <li> They smell really great, and the price is very good for what they do.  </li>
            <li> It does a splendid job of cleaning hair</li>
            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was great.</li>
            <li> Smelled great worked well.</li>
            <li> great after I go swimming, to get the salt and chlorine out of my hair.</li>
            <li> That was until I woke up with the driest, itchiest scalp I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> as a shampoo, it works great.</li>
            <li> It smelled great and made my hair silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the bottle, I can tell that it smells great.</li>
            <li> was really great.  </li>
            <li> My scalp and hair felt great.</li>
            <li> and it smells great.</li>
            <li> All in all a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, I never had so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love great hair products and this one is definitely great.</li>
            <li> But the good news- I have started paying close attention to the products and chemicals I put on my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is superior.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and leaves a \\&quot;just-right\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li> The result has been good hair days again.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this product from the day I bought it:</li>
            <li> I loved the product when I bought it.</li>
            <li> My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  </li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t do my hair or scalp much good.  </li>
            <li> It feels silkier (NOT oily) and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I started using this and loved it</li>
            <li> because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say a good 1/4 of the bottle was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was hopeful that it would also be a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got compliments from my husband after that it smelled good</li>
            <li> and it did smell good for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked, it cleaned my hair, it rinsed fairly well, it didn&#x27;t have an offensive odor, and there isn&#x27;t a lot else to say.  </li>
            <li> all were good.  </li>
            <li> I loved the feeling it gave my hair - nourished, just like the package promises.</li>
            <li> So, unless you are making your own or buying pricey health food store purist products, you will find this product attractive and not at all objectionable.</li>
            <li> you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.</li>
            <li> a range of shampoos and conditioners that feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the comments very interesting.  </li>
            <li> I was horrified that many people experienced hair loss and some had rashes.  </li>
            <li> Like many others, I experienced severe itchiness from using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I first used this it was great!  </li>
            <li> My first thoughts about this product were that is smells AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair felt thinner and could feel more of my scalp!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Please...if you love your hair, don&#x27;t use this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my hair after using the product!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> (I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li> I noticed the smell was pleasant even though I was sure it was a chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I liked the shampoo but the packaging needs a bit of work.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> , liked the fact that it does have an hydrolyzed animal protein.</li>
            <li> So I must be honest</li>
            <li> I have honestly been losing alot if hair</li>
            <li> Nice and styled curls that were bouncey.</li>
            <li> Nice to touch and comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and lathers well</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of Pantene Pro V or Pert Plus.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person who reads the ingredients list of EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Even if I liked the product a lot, the bottle design will keep me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It is with great sadness that I say that these reviews of hair loss are true.</li>
            <li> Also contains the laurel this and laurel that are are used for cleaning garage floors, so the soap part is very strong.  </li>
            <li> I shouldnt have to worry about becoming bald!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about how healthy my hair looks,and I love it!</li>
            <li> At first I loved it!</li>
            <li> IT BETTER WORK! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks to Clear, my hair is so much more manageable, smells delicious, and my scalp feels great!</li>
            <li> Ingredients in this product isn&#x27;t suitable for the hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you want your hair to look, feel, and smell fantastic, but in a way that cannot be good for it...</li>
            <li> , great things rarely come with a price tag of $4...</li>
            <li> But after just three weeks of using this product I have a fist full of hair in my hand after I shower!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing and perming my own hair for 45 years &amp; African Pride is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li> Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, and plumped up my hair for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece).</li>
            <li> For normal hair people it should be wonderful, but for me it is worth it because it gets rid of the dandruff!</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if all these things stop happening.</li>
            <li> this many people could not be making this up.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use the product for 3 days.</li>
            <li> My hair is now more gray than brown and is getting a courser texture.</li>
            <li> The flip-open top on the shampoo bottle cannot be sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t noticed the thinning hair issue as many others have posted</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks and no problem my hair smelled lovely</li>
            <li> I contacted the company as I think this product should be pulled off the shelf with so many people having these issues.</li>
            <li> This is an economical shampoo, with good results.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the drug store one day when I noticed the prominent display.</li>
            <li> Many people are allergic to sulfates and they don&#x27;t even know it.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the fancy award winning products do not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage but can&#x27;t always afford it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim and after a couple months I&#x27;ve been really pleased.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer, shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li> but I should have known better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting better (the rash)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like a conditioner ..</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I came here to give a rave review about how I love this shampoo and it smwlla</li>
            <li> Although now that I think about it I have been losing more than I ever remember.</li>
            <li> Even my hair stylist would remark every time she cut it how amazingly healthy my hair was.  </li>
            <li> Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the conditioner that goes with this.</li>
            <li> That makes me the most upset.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> The labeling is misleading, as it proclaims that it will \\&quot;nourish the scalp\\&quot; and more.</li>
            <li> It felt like the texture of my hair changed for the better.</li>
            <li> With this product, I think I&#x27;ll be able to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> but it makes sense that a healthy scalp will support healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li> Most products have them.</li>
            <li> It took a while (many months) to figure out that it was this shampoo/conditioner brand.</li>
            <li> more so, that I&#x27;ve been doing it to myself...</li>
            <li> this happened to so many of you as well.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> More like the POISONS.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> just one more thing.</li>
            <li> I immediately felt better.  </li>
            <li> I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with.</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li> And I liked the clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Great smelling producting, decent at cleansing.  </li>
            <li> This product is deceiving; at first I loved it, but over many months, it ruined my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> After looking online and at these reviews, I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s this product because I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction to any kind of product ever in my life!</li>
            <li> At first I truly loved this product.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the pretty scent and the pretty light color of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using the long lengths for almost two months and still have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li> At first I too loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and to be quite honest, I rarely am.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Nourishing shampoo, I thought this would be my new best friend.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are impressive for a conventional shampoo since a lot of healthy ones are included.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed so far.</li>
            <li> At first, Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty shampoo and conditioner seemed to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Soft, silky hair and great smell.</li>
            <li> almost immediately  after washing i can see my scalp literally  drying up and becoming flaking within minutes.</li>
            <li> really thought it might be good from the smell</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo, and wanted it to be awesome, but within a couple of days, I began noticing my scalp was super tender, like it had little cuts or something, and I was losing tons of hair, like I have never seen, even when I was pregnant years ago</li>
            <li> (couldn&#x27;t comb through it easily), so I didn&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> I have easily lost over 50% of the hair at my crown.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because some members of our family have easily irritated scalps.  </li>
            <li> Strong lingering fragrance which doesn&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
            <li> The chemicals are too strong in the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this product, I thought it was amazing</li>
            <li> Am hoping this will end soon as I only used this twice..extremely traumatizing, I had beautiful hair before this happened..</li>
            <li> At first, I liked the product, but within two weeks, I started losing handfuls of hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product at first, but then my hair started falling out (A LOT).</li>
            <li> I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, light and healthy all day.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the great smell of lilacs, not too strong but very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Clinically proven to help restore scalp&#x27;s natural moisture balance to create the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gently cleanses &amp; nourishes scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> In the shower it was fine-</li>
            <li> My scalp seems fine, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, but lots of it.</li>
            <li> As I continued using it, my hair felt dirtier and oilier more quickly, and my scalp began to itch.</li>
            <li> I am paying a huge amount of money for medications.</li>
            <li> my hair started falling out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li> (smelled fantastic and made</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the nourishment of the scalp, but I do know that it leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic and they leave my hair smelling fantastic for over a day.</li>
            <li> This product provides a light cleansing and does not leave a build-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I received some coupons from the company to get two free bottles.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Saw all of the reviews on here, and it confirmed my suspicions.</li>
            <li> Blood work came back great.</li>
            <li> These products are excellent in the fact that I didn&#x27;t have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  </li>
            <li> I got this for free through shespeaks and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will stop I really enjoy having hair.</li>
            <li> I actually thought my hair felt great</li>
            <li> /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and has completely cleared up my chronic dandruff.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product for right now.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are water and the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate, plus a nice variety of oils including sunflower and coconut</li>
            <li> DO NOT purchase ANY of the Clear shampoo or conditioners!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has also thinned my hair out significantly from all the hair loss.  </li>
            <li> first several times I used this shampoo I loved it!</li>
            <li> Not patches, just gradual and in significant amounts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to use this because Allure Magazine rated it the &amp;#34;Best Shampoo&amp;#34; for 2012.</li>
            <li> ot there it certainly isn&#x27;t worth the risk!</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago, I noticed that I was losing a significant amount of hair at the crown of my head and along my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I used a trial sample tonight, and significant amount of hair fell off from my scalp in the shower.</li>
            <li> First off I love the scent.</li>
            <li> whereas Pantene&#x27;s long hair formula (great lengths) cannot even compare.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, I noticed that my hair was more shiny and softer.</li>
            <li> the smell is delicious and my hair hasn&#x27;t been falling out ( just the usual).</li>
            <li> honestly cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it made it feel really clean.</li>
            <li> and I have been MUCH more satisfied than with the Clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this in that it leaves my scalp feeling clean without that tingly feeling you get with some dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I reviewed Clear conditioner recently, and was very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s clean, it looks and feels greasy</li>
            <li> my ends seem to look pretty full and healthy to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Discover the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair with new Clear scalp and hair beauty therapy</li>
            <li> This shampoo only gives me one day of good looking, clean hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and shiny, and it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> I used it one night and it left my hair very silky and smooth, and it smelled great.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li> I was finding everywhere, do laudry and the lint trap would be full of the hair that was on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed my scalp with the shower head for like 15-20 full minutes to no avail</li>
            <li> Yes, Clear does lather nicely.  </li>
            <li> A good shampoo that cleans and protects your hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found a lot of information online about sulfate-free shampoos, which are more gentle than the majority of shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I used Clear shampoo and the conditioner and for months i used it because i liked how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li> I received some samples of it and used them while traveling and loved the way it made my hair look and feel, so I switched and began using it daily.  </li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly, but leaves my hair both soft and manageable, with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> I did try the one specifically for dandruff but those results weren&#x27;t as good as the regular formula.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely looks good from the packaging</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I washed my sister&#x27;s hair with it</li>
            <li> Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shampoo, it leaves your hair clean and feeling moist even when wet.</li>
            <li> the smell does not linger after rinsing out, but I&#x27;d rather use something a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so fresh and CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it&#x27;s just a LIE.  </li>
            <li> If this product does not fade my color quickly I will write another review and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> not all hundreds of complaints are just super senstive to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try some argan oil shampoo to try to quickly fix this problem, and will never use this shampoo/conditioner again.</li>
            <li> My hair has came out tremendously.</li>
            <li> From the first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a HUGE difference in my scalp and hair after first use.  </li>
            <li> Since all blood work was normal, I feel confident I have diagnosed the problem</li>
            <li> When i first bought this shampoo, it was because i had a coupon for buy one and get one free.</li>
            <li> The internet is full of useful information, so why not use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, for the first time in my life the ends are just about reaching to the waistband of my pants :)  When my hair gets down to my butt, I will go to the salon and give it a good trim -</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner felt instantly soothing when I put it on, which was nice, and my scalp feels really clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was appealing with it&#x27;s fresh smell and decent price point.</li>
            <li> but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> This is not my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> so great until I read through previous reviews where people are saying it is making their hair fall out.</li>
            <li> Your hair is not actually absorbing nutrients from your scalp, pleasant as that idea may be.</li>
            <li> I do have highlighted hair but pretty damn healthy thanks to joico and redeken.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> First, I will say I have NEVER, EVER written a review of any product in my life!  </li>
            <li> Really!?!</li>
            <li> I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent, completely unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this shampoo was great because it made my hair soft and made it easy for me to comb through my long hair, but while in the shower and running the conditioner through my hair, clumps of hair would end up in my hands.</li>
            <li> many other reviewers, at first I thought I really liked the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely happy and have told everyone I know about it and the few that have tried it also substantial differences in there hair and</li>
            <li> so I figured these were worth a try.  </li>
            <li> However, the Clear shampoo did much more.</li>
            <li> As befits a Unilever product it is solid, the opening and closing of the dispenser is smooth and it feels good to hold since it was probably contoured to fit the human hand.</li>
            <li> It works I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does a great job for me, and I double the effect by using it along with the Clear conditioner.  </li>
            <li> i love this product so far.</li>
            <li> but i won&#x27;t  stop using it because so far  I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped  washing my hair with  hot water (still enjoy my hot showers)</li>
            <li> At first I liked it and had no issues, then I began to notice more hair in and around my sink, on my pillow, on my desk, in the shower and after a couple of weeks my hair line thinned, and my hair felt super limp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, so when I let this air dry and my slightly wavy hair turned out with perfect waves and was so smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and my hair feels so soft after using.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a chance a few months ago and actually liked it at first (mostly because of the smell).</li>
            <li> and I said to myself &#x27;something isnt right here&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in shock, the culprit was right in front of me.  </li>
            <li> It seems like all the shampoos out there right now are so moisturizing that they make your hair greasy right away.  </li>
            <li> And while this shampoo didn&#x27;t change that exactly, it did seem to make my hair softer and thus more tractable after about three or four washes with the Clear Scalp conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At first I was IN LOVE with Clear.</li>
            <li> My boss would tease me and say &amp;#34;you shedding&amp;#34; i laughed and brushed it off as normal.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  </li>
            <li> Many of the ingredients are natural and they rinse clean and leave your hair manageable, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more gentle and natural product.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li> I know immediately after the first wash if my hair is going to like a shampoo or not, given that I have slightly wavy hair that needs a good blow out or</li>
            <li> gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch out my shampoo to a new one after this bottle was gone and literally after the first use of the new shampoo my head stopped itching and i am already feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li> This was the first thing that I noticed immediately.  </li>
            <li> It was coming out consistently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten like three compliments just this week on how shiny and pretty</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t even aware of it until she showed me with a mirror.  </li>
            <li> After using this product , it never failed that I would get acne of my scalp.and</li>
            <li> I should have come here to read these reviews first when the hair loss began since I thought it was something else.  </li>
            <li> I will be definitely purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Simply put, when I wake up these days, my hair looks pretty respectable and all I have to do is brush it and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny reading all the reviews that say their hair was falling out.  </li>
            <li> many others, I have been to 2 doctors and had numerous blood test done to see what may have been wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This review is mostly the same as the one for its sister product, Volumizing Root Boost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Used this 2 times first week of July.  </li>
            <li> the same thing has been happening to many users.</li>
            <li> With this many complaints of the same issue, at some point don&#x27;t you think that they might say \\&quot;hmmm...</li>
            <li> I first purchased this shampoo because it was on sale, and based on the television ads.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the breakage first and quit using the product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked and it was very embarrassing!</li>
            <li> no so much!</li>
            <li> It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...</li>
            <li> Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...</li>
            <li> So what exactly are the benefits of the shampoo alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product definitely gives great results but I object to the long list of chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li> I simply love it and cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I washed me hair 2 more times with a different shampoo to relieve the pain which helped a bit.</li>
            <li> I first saw this shampoo at Walmart.</li>
            <li> i am on my second wash and i absolutely  love  </li>
            <li> on my  readings hot water for your scalp is a no no.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I felt like my head was in a fog.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well</li>
            <li> The shampoo is OK but the fragrance is a little too strong.  </li>
            <li> Though I can&#x27;t say much for the conditioner because I only use it on my ends (a fine hair tip - don&#x27;t condition your scalp!)</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter had been using it as well, and has had a significant amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> So I bought the travel size bottles of the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner and so far I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li> they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen and find this is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> my hair super soft)...</li>
            <li> The only person who could easily get anything out of them is someone with hands like King Kong.</li>
            <li> and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing to be able to use less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They assumed it was most likely a normal change for my age (29) or just stress and that it should pass...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair falling out in large clumps.</li>
            <li> Pure poison.  </li>
            <li> I probably would not write to persons I know endorsing it but would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Aveeno&#x27;s Pure Renewal Sulfate-Free shampoo</li>
            <li> But when people at work started picking hair off my clothes, I started noticing my hair was falling out in large quantities.</li>
            <li> Id say that is quite a large reason to stop buying it.</li>
            <li> I eventually noticed I was losing more hair than normal and really started to worry because I could finally see/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found two excellent and MUCH less harsh shampoos</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that tends to get frizzy (with coarse gray hairs as well).</li>
            <li> But based on other reviews, I&#x27;m glad I threw this away after the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li> I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing</li>
            <li> To top it all off, I then developed a rash like dematitis in my head with little pus filled bumps.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product make me think that I had lice because I was itching so much, it also made my hair fall out in huge clumps.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I tried not to think much of it</li>
            <li> (jump up and run really)</li>
            <li> I received the Total Care Nourishing and the Damage and Color Repair shampoos and conditioners for free</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very creamy feel.</li>
            <li> It was a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> It was really upsetting</li>
            <li> Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> yet it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week, and SO MUCH HAIR LOSS.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle also leaves much to be desired....</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes, went back to wash my hair again with Castille soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) because there was a 6 foot radius of smelly floral (cheap) scent surrounding</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample locally and tossed it after one try.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is very itchy as well.</li>
            <li> My hair turned shiny and very manageable, almost immediately after beginning its use.</li>
            <li> But now my hair has thinned so much that i see my scalp</li>
            <li> I USE to HAVE Tons of Hair; people were jealous at how much hair I had but NOT so much now.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t need much shampoo or much from a shampoo, and this bottle lasted a while.</li>
            <li> This really foams up as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It really does a thourough cleaning job of the scalp without stripping the hair of moisture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is shedding so much</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the problems others complain about, and it does a great job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> It started feeling thinner, not curling nearly as much as it used to, gets oily a lot faster... and its falling out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem like it really cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li> I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li> It also gave me a very irritated scalp and sores.</li>
            <li> Your results after stopping use are greatly appreciated...</li>
            <li> and I could not figure out why y hair was shedding so much.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon review for scaring the s</li>
            <li> I NEVER take the time out to write reviews for any product I purchase, but this has really changed my hair.</li>
            <li> keep in mind, i have lots of hair, very curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said this was unusual...</li>
            <li> I have a very oily, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair would come out in many strands in the shower and was enough to completely cover and clog the drain each time.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried the Clear products &amp; have since bought them at my local store.</li>
            <li> but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched.</li>
            <li> I found it made a real different in how my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair felt and was able to be managed, so I was eager to try Clear shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love my new long, thicker and shiny hair</li>
            <li> clear scalp and hair therapy shampoo was!!!  </li>
            <li> have thick hair that pretty much has a life of its own.  </li>
            <li> You may be one of the users that doesn&#x27;t have an issue, but with so many other products</li>
            <li> It was all normal!</li>
            <li> I received this through the Vine Voices program and was really excited about the prospect of a shampoo that would possibly take care of my scalp too.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, this product made my hair fall out in clumps.</li>
            <li> I have long, but fine hair</li>
            <li> It also left my hair very shiney and full of life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly think my hair shone much with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and fairly long.  </li>
            <li> Not sure, but hope that the makers of this product continue to supply us, that have had great results, with further hair care lines.  </li>
            <li> If you were to have dry hair or very thick hair, this shampoo should be wonderful for you.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is more viscous than other shampoos, so I was able to use less; this shampoo did leave my hair wetter longer after showering, noticeably so; that&#x27;s is, though.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use the shampoo in conjunction with the corresponding conditioner that I am able to easily pass a comb thru my wet hair, which is not the case at all with other products.</li>
            <li> I obviously discontinued use, but she said it will take a month to see a full improvement.</li>
            <li> I would be interested in a class action lawsuit.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> This product also made the skin around my scalp, neck, and shoulders feel really difference than normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo/conditioner under the sun, and this is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair has been color treated and tends to be very fine and limp.  </li>
            <li> NEW!</li>
            <li> and I sometimes like trying new things that look promising.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it and attributed it to stress from a new job.</li>
            <li> When dry, my hair looks, feels, and smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped my hair a ton and it finally started growing back, its now shiny, not frizzy, looks a million times better.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of lathering and</li>
            <li> I recently started using this shampoo and started noticing a tremendous amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> but I suspect that now, since they often include some sort of botanical essence or extract in so many products, that some sort of essential oil, possibly lavendar oil, may be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, let me say I only actually used this once.  </li>
            <li> *** out of me, except for a decent amount of volume, shine, and length contribution.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> i suffer from very itchy dry scalp and dandruff (mostly in the front and middle of my scalp).</li>
            <li> 100% certain Clear products are to blame.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I have quit using this shampoo for almost one week and have noticed a little bit of a difference in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing, but I&#x27;m sure it will take time.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s worked for me! !</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon Vine for bringing Clear into my life.....</li>
            <li> This product seemed to clear the oil from my hair very well, and made it manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of Clear that my hair is so long - it smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li> CLEAR shampoo and conditioner  really does focus on giving  your scalp the therapy  </li>
            <li> All results normal.  </li>
            <li> My colored hair(which is normally shiny and sleek)</li>
            <li> Bummer there are so many harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I switched to wen after my first flare, because it was natural, but even some of the natural ingredients caused me issues.  </li>
            <li> always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even mentioned that my hair was thinner and drier than normal.  </li>
            <li> All was normal, but my hair kept falling out.</li>
            <li> I started using the Clear Shampoo and Conditioner about 2 years ago, YES 2 yrs, that&#x27;s how much hair I had so much that it took nearly a year for me to notice that I was loosing my hair.</li>
            <li> I too went to doctors; 2 in fact, had blood work done, came out normal.</li>
            <li> My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal thickness after throwing this rat poison in the trash?  </li>
            <li> Iron and ferritin completely normal.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in no way prone to headaches, only if I have a rare hangover).  </li>
            <li> I am over it and won&#x27;t pass it along to a friend like I normally do because it seems this system has something fishy going on with it.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy anymore and with the onset of gray hair I have noticed the texture of my hair changing to a more coarser feel.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in April of 2014 and looking back, I didn&#x27;t really notice any issues for the first 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> My psoriasis came back in full force and I&#x27;ve lost nearly all my hair.</li>
            <li> There should be a Class Action Lawsuit against the manufacturer of the Clear Brand!!!</li>
            <li> I was given good size samples of this shampoo and conditioner at my local supermarket the other day and tried them the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27yo female, and I feel like my 60yo dad right now.</li>
            <li> Looking for answers, on a long shot I looked up Clear shampoo reviews since that was one thing that had changed leading up to the significant hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The containers are way too large, you can&#x27;t &#x27;squeeze&#x27; them because it&#x27;s a hard plastic, and you can&#x27;t unscrew the top because it isn&#x27;t made that way.</li>
            <li> In the last 6 months, large patches of my hair started getting really coarse/wiry.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Shampoo might actually live up to its advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to try new things</li>
            <li> Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I had neither the problems that others have had nor any particular benefits other than clean hair that any shampoo could deliver.</li>
            <li> I switch between the long lengths and total care to keep my hair from becoming ammune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> a flat iron run through to limit frizz, I was surprised as how much the shampoo tamed all of that without the need for hot tools.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair very natural.</li>
            <li> so thankful for these amazon reviewers that lead me to the conclusion that Clear hair products will make your hair fall out!</li>
            <li> I urge whomever is reading this to please not buy any Clear hair products!</li>
            <li> After 3 shampoos my head was the completely clear!</li>
            <li> They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li> NOT WITH CLEAR!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, that all lasted only for that first week.</li>
            <li> First of all, the massive hair loss and breakage I had has stopped.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my hair still gets pretty oily the day after washing so it hasn&#x27;t helped with that.</li>
            <li> Stay far away from these products!</li>
            <li> I also started to notice that my hair was falling out more than usual</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty basic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li> this product so far!.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way which is certainly nice for the pocketbook.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three bottles so far, which is a lot for a compulsive tester of new products.</li>
            <li> At first, the shampoo left my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I really hope that it goes back to normal soon.</li>
            <li> Thinking back, I was noticing more hair coming out in the shower because I had to start keeping it from going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the positive reviews are from people who just starting using this.</li>
            <li> Secondly, my plaques are not nearly as heavy as normal, and I don&#x27;t have as much itching.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day.</li>
            <li> noticed no difference on my scalp, so overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone concerned with lack of hair volume or who wants to have shiny, soft hair!</li>
            <li> I started using this last year some time and have noticed that my hair has been falling out in large clumps.  </li>
            <li> My hair is already fine so losing more really stinks.</li>
            <li> Clear shampoo needs to be removed from the market permanently, because it&#x27;s truly a rip off.  </li>
            <li> if I hadn&#x27;t thrown the Clear in the trash who knows how much hair I would have left?</li>
            <li> and that is when I started to look up reviews for the Clear Scalp and Therapy shampoo line.  </li>
            <li> Not with this Clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I have less of this item to clean each month.</li>
            <li> Clear shampoo claims to nourish your scalp and thereby your hair.</li>
            <li> So, I went to the store and switched to the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy:</li>
            <li> rate \\&quot;CLEAR</li>
            <li> I will be a permanent CLEAR user from now on.  </li>
            <li> I used the Clear Scalp and Hair therapy shampoo and conditioner every two days before, but now I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner every time.  </li>
            <li> use tea tree oil at night and then in the morning I washed my hair with clear shampoo and apply Clear conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t click that Clear was the source of my hair loss until I realized that as soon as I stopped using it</li>
            <li> I am going to stop using clear and see if the hair loss remains.</li>
            <li> I had been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for about a year.</li>
            <li> I received the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty nourishing shampoo and have been using it as needed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using Clear for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for over a year.</li>
            <li> I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> I will never use another product from the Clear line.</li>
            <li> Then I found Clear.</li>
            <li> Clear has literally transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I have been losing so much hair that I have to clear the drain twice while I shower.</li>
            <li> clear needs to be taken off the shelves</li>
            <li> Had red welts on scalp that were very itchy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now with no breakage since discontinuing Clear shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing.</li>
            <li> When I would brush it the brush was completely covered with hair and during the day I would run my fingers through my hair and get a TON of strands.  </li>
            <li> I am guessing also became sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I was staying at a hotel</li>
            <li> I now have completely damaged scalp and about 50% of the amount of hair</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used the shampoo only once, I can&#x27;t tell if it will improve the condition of my scalp as much as it has my hair, but I am eager to discover the effect there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have grey hairs that I color frequently because I&#x27;m pretty young, (25)</li>
            <li> As I am about to turn 59, I doubt I will ever have the opportunity to have long pretty hair again.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started with this product my scalp has completely healed.</li>
            <li> It makes my  damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li> I really hope my hair bounces back!</li>
            <li> I naturally thought it was my Metformin medications.</li>
            <li> I can no longer wear my hair up or in a ponytail because when I pull it back it shows so much scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to some of the products they use there.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shinier than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> When I saw my 20 year old son&#x27;s hair getting thinner</li>
            <li> It both lathers well and rinses out completely.</li>
            <li> After using this about a month, the texture of my hair had completely changed.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my hair was soft, even after just shampooing before conditioning</li>
            <li> I tend to get allergic reactions to products, but not this one so far.</li>
            <li> and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time.</li>
            <li> I do not have a sensitive scalp...</li>
            <li> In early November, I started using Clear.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was much thinner and starting to look sparse in some areas and a couple of days ago, (jan18)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have especially problematic hair, I keep it short, and there is no artificial coloring to worry about.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line and the shine/scalp improvement I get by using it, but alas, I cannot spend as much as I used to on haircare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever dye my hair but in addition to all this, I noticed many strands seem to be losing some of their natural pigment - not drastic color loss like graying, but the pigment in each individual strand has become uneven.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is now ultra thick and so healthy.  </li>
            <li> if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally after realizing it was the shampoo mostly ( I used them as a test) causing the problems I goggled it and saw all the other complaints same as mine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any more breakage than I have in the past, and I definitely have not experienced my hair falling out in clumps as some other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> My usual shampoo cleans my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  </li>
            <li> a serious research of this shampoo ingredients I read that zinc helps to stop help lost and in in most cases help to regrowth</li>
            <li> well after many serious reviews and complaints I will be immediately throwing this garbage where it belongs.</li>
            <li> I usually like them, but not enough to go out of my way to buy/request more of.</li>
            <li> In the past I have also not been able to use the same shampoo brand for an extended period of time for some reason.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to buy the full size bottle.</li>
            <li> The neck rash took a week of applying cream and being diligent about keeping the area dry and washing with gentle soap for it to clear.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine hair, an oily scalp at the top and a dry scalp at the base of my head...</li>
            <li> But how long will it take for my very irritated scalp to go back to normal??  </li>
            <li> Just add me to the long list of people who have had hair loss thanks to this product, I had no idea it was my shampoo.</li>
            <li> First it changed the texture of my hair to a rather rough texture.  </li>
            <li> Since the whole premise behind this product line is scalp health, and I obviously don&#x27;t have a healthy one, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> but all my tests came back normal.</li>
            <li> Thyroid tests came back completely normal.</li>
            <li> Ditched the shampoo and all was back to normal.</li>
            <li> I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li> and they ran a bunch of tests which all came back normal.</li>
            <li> This is the only new product I was using.</li>
            <li> I have only used my new shampoo for two days.  </li>
            <li> Very upset &amp; very embarrassed that my hair was missing around the edges.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I had fine, thin hair to begin with and didn&#x27;t have this kind of hair to lose!  </li>
            <li> My hairline (especially around my temples) has thinned so much you can see my white scalp.</li>
            <li> I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years</li>
            <li> The shampoo was delivered to me in a box containing no other items.</li>
            <li> did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use....</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and frizzy hair, and this has really helped to tame it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> , lathers easily (even in hard water) &amp; the conditioner makes my hair soft &amp; I can actually get a comb thru it.</li>
            <li> I normally have fine but very thick blond hair, and now my scalp was showing a LOT around my part and all around the crown.  </li>
            <li> So here I am, a lovely shade of golden blonde - buying expensive hair shampoo after hair shampoo only to decide on Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty on a whim, shortly after seeing it&#x27;s name in Allure magazine.</li>
            <li> Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li> Formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C &amp; E, sunflower, almond, soybean &amp; coconut oils &amp; aloe</li>
            <li> Generally, unless I use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;agree\\&quot; with it, my hair looks and behaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use shampoo, of course, but I generally buy whatever&#x27;s cheapest.</li>
            <li> I bought the Clear brand shampoo I bought two different kinds of it.  </li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Total Care for All Hair Types.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care</li>
            <li> I stopped use of Clear and went back to Herbal Essence (never had a problem with this shampoo) and the strands stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> Shortly after stopping this and the Clear Conditioner, my head stopped itching and my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore.</li>
            <li> In short, steer clear of these products.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Clear and went back to Pantene and Jhirmack.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the Clear Total Care Shampoo and Conditioner for 6 months now, and she raves about it!  </li>
            <li> Everytime I see the Clear commercial, I want to punch Heidi Klum in the face!</li>
            <li> However, it did appear greasy once again, so I switched back to Clear.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed healthier scalp, so I figured I&#x27;d try Clear, since it was inexpensive enough.</li>
            <li> Within hours I had blisters on my hands and a scalp weeping clear fluid.</li>
            <li> read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li> I switched to African Pride 2-1 shampoo conditioner &amp; to my amazement my hair made a complete recovery.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and fluid.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was milder and left my scalp as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as conversant with the chemicals in this product</li>
            <li> My scalp itched and developed tiny scabs, as another commenter reported.</li>
            <li> it feels like straight shampoo, not much in suds ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and am about to complete my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will release some corresponding styling products in the near future.</li>
            <li> As far as the rest of the consumers that are having opposite effects, sounds as if it is an allergic reaction to an ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look up the reviews on this brand and noticed so many people, approximately 75% were complaining of hair loss.</li>
            <li> conditioner feels thick and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very reminiscent of the original herbal essences shampoo only a little softer.</li>
            <li> After the second use, my gray hair no longer seemed coarse but had the same texture as the rest of my hair - it feels almost as soft as my 3 year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that other one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight.</li>
            <li> I also have psoriasis and a very reactive scalp so my hair routine was an endless cycle of: coloring hair -&gt; irritated scalp.</li>
            <li> I think this is due to having been moisturized too much by the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing really \\&quot;wow\\&quot; about the product compared to all the other types I&#x27;ve tried and used.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it is normal to lose 50 or even 100 hairs a day, so this was hard to notice at first.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007RTR898 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> i recently purchased a big jug of both  clear  shampoo and the conditioner at BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Then the second time, I developed a rash on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am particularly sensitive, but it seems like several customers have had the same problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently switched a couple of months back to the natural Herbal Essence line with no parabens and noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going back to regular old anti-dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, this has been the ONLY product that I have used that ever completely cleared my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair, but I am transitioning to natural</li>
            <li> So she made me go write a good review because she&#x27;s afraid they&#x27;ll stop making this shampoo for her to buy if they only listened to the complainers.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair short thinking that it would get better and it just got worse.</li>
            <li> Long list of chemicals that no one needs near their skin.  </li>
            <li> Like so many of the previous reviewers, this shampoo was VERY harsh and had adverse effects.</li>
            <li> After I used this, it left my hair quite greasy looking even though I had spent a decent amount of time rinsing my hair after washing.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are a real let down.</li>
            <li> First, the bottle indicates that the scalp benefits are only indicated when the conditioner is also used, so I bet the shampoo does little or nothing to help your scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very long and fine, but thick.</li>
            <li> I paid $50 for my hair to be checked by a professional lice checking company, just to find out that I did not have lice but that my scalp was ridiculously dry and to change my shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to have soft, shiny hair, but now it&#x27;s dry with a hint of grease or something.</li>
            <li> I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc</li>
            <li> Combing through my hair when wet resulted in a comb FULL of hair and once dried and styled, there were still strands falling all over the house and sticking to my clothes...</li>
            <li> I had hair loss, but it&#x27;s possible I lost a little more than usual.</li>
            <li> He had the most beautiful thick hair and now I FEEL TERRIBLE GUILT OVER BUYING THIS SHAMPOO!!!</li>
            <li> However, within a few weeks of regular use, I started to notice some redness and itchiness in my scalp and also MUCH more hair falling out than usual.</li>
            <li> prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry and curl the ends later.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a clarifying shampoo several days in a row to wash out whatever residue that stuff had left that had really weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Again, I have really fine hair, so I definitely don&#x27;t need a product meant to wash, leave a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li> This is why customer reviews are so important as opposed to the opinion of one magazine or one &amp;#34;expert.&amp;#34; I hope this helps out anyone considering to purchase this shampoo so that you do not have to go through the trouble of repairing your scalp and hair from this harsh product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discovering the ugly truth about this shampoo, I threw it away and started searching for a gentle shampoo to make my hair and scalp healthy again.</li>
            <li> She has long thick black Asian hair, but most shampoos (like Pantene) make it fall out in mass --</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything different from other corporate shampoos - except worse smell than many.</li>
            <li> Its not strong and annoying but its perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a senior citizen with long, thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, it was still a little slick and after just one day, it was filled with grease and needed another washing.</li>
            <li> but I just thought it was due to natural shedding.</li>
            <li> It made my hair shiny and soft but the hair loss is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and breaking off from dying it and using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> and some of my hair was ear length while the back part was long.</li>
            <li> I have really long, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since washed my hair twice with the normal shampoo, and my scalp still feels incredibly dried out and itchy.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s a challenge to find products that make it soft without weighing it down or making it greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> About half way through the bottle I stopped using Clear because it was drying out my hair and giving me severe dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The skin around the back of the ears has become extremely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> It takes about ten minutes for my hair to get wet enough to put shampoo in.</li>
            <li> The design of the conditioner bottle was a pain in the but to try and squeeze out what&#x27;s left if it; especially when you&#x27;re in the shower and your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I have thick, salt and pepper hair that I wear short and very layered.</li>
            <li> I have naturally greasy thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the final effects on my hair will be, but so far I am devastated and will need to cut my long hair due to the extreme damage this product has caused.</li>
            <li> It was new and i was looking for a product to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> My hair also seemed to be getting very dry and brittle and actually getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> It happened to me with other brands of shampoos, but certainly not with Clear.  </li>
            <li> I lost so much hair, my hair line is ruined, I hardly have a ponytail anymore.</li>
            <li> But this is the first shampoo set that she&#x27;s used where she barely loses a single strand from washing!  </li>
            <li> Not a good first impression.</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought in a million years that this stuff would really work well.</li>
            <li> i am absolutely scared  because of  all the negative reviews</li>
            <li> I used this product for a long time and after a while my hair dresser told me I had loss of hair at the crown of my scalp.</li>
            <li> But even if I run a wide tooth comb through my hair after I get out of the shower, clumps of my hair will fall out from where I brushed it.</li>
            <li> Hair, once it leaves the follicle, is not alive and can&#x27;t eat anything.</li>
            <li> I used to take handfuls of hair out while washing (I have really long hair)</li>
            <li> The bottom of the shower had long strands (not breakage...full strands...from the root) all over it every time I showered.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that for how long these reviews have been coming in, this product is still sold.</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this shampoo (no conditioner), and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed: not much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent countless hours researching illnesses that may cause symptoms like these...</li>
            <li> No one with fingernails can possibly hold this bottle with wet hands and squeeze the contents without difficulty.</li>
            <li> i know it hasn&#x27;t been long enough,so  </li>
            <li> Such a bad choice when one of the ingredients is one of the top seven most dangerous anaphylaxic chemicals known.</li>
            <li> Around that time, I noticed that my hair was falling out a lot more than usual, but dismissed it blaming it on the summer heat, something I had done like not getting enough of some nutrient/vitamin, or just random shedding.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the other bottle to see if it did the same thing (just burn, I thought).  </li>
            <li> Of the three other brands of shampoo I use, this one left my hair fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> so I defer to the opinions of the other reviewers on that score, but I personally like the results this shampoo produced.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra hair falling out</li>
            <li> Hopefully the manufacturer will take complaints about their product seriously enough to change the formula to prevent this from continuing with other consumers.</li>
            <li> Several other members of my family tried these products as well.  </li>
            <li> And by the looks of the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before.</li>
            <li> whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis!</li>
            <li> I started using this product and did start noticing a lot of hair falling out in shower and with the towel I used to dry my hair off.  </li>
            <li> I blew it dry and almost cried.</li>
            <li> I do not straighten, blow dry or color it.</li>
            <li> Five minutes after my hair was dry, I had it combed out and braided.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry</li>
            <li> Moisturizing Dry Scalp formula.</li>
            <li> my hair started looking oily, yet dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Just wash, apply leave in conditioner and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is dry and itchy which has never been before.</li>
            <li> The hair loss has stopped, and my hair is now softer and not as dry.  </li>
            <li> I decided to check the reviews, and was shocked that so many people have had the same problem, so I felt compelled to write this review.  </li>
            <li> i have dry scalp to begin with and was hoping this would help</li>
            <li> I googled the reviews for this product today and I am shocked to find so many people with the same experience.  </li>
            <li> My hair is DRY because I dye it ..</li>
            <li> I have never had dry scalp issues before.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the shampoo would help to take care of the dry and itchy part of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shampoos and conditioners from everything from Lazartigue to Kiehls and always had a problem with a dry, itchy scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes at least 15 minutes for me to comb out the tangles.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find out exactly what Nutrium 10, the secret ingredient in Clear shampoo, might be.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I developed a tiny rash behind both my ears the next morning.  </li>
            <li> At first, I just thought dandruff was the reason behind my irritated scalp.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry, flaky, itchy dandruff for years!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight and thin.</li>
            <li> She has long, straight, thin hair as well.</li>
            <li> I was only left with a small sample.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair that squeaky dry feeling when wet like after using a clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoos in the past  and  </li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old girl that has long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful thick hair is what gives every woman confidence...how dare this company just sit back and allow for their product to do such horrible things to people.</li>
            <li> I have very long think hair, so often shampoos weigh it down or cause me to spend way too long trying to rinse it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair started looking flat after shampooing, like it was weighed down.</li>
            <li> , I can only wear it certain ways without looking ill.</li>
            <li> I have extremely course, dry hair that has been damaged by years of bleaching, highlighting and hair dyeing.  </li>
            <li> just like alot of other ladies on here..also made my scalp itchy and dry, never had dandruff until i tried this line of shampoo..</li>
            <li> it has caused us to loose our hair!  </li>
            <li> Maybe your hair type makes a difference: my hair is very thick, coarse and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> Only used this shampoo about three times over the course of a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that when I rinsed my hair, a yarn sized strand of hair would end up coming out.</li>
            <li> I kept using it, but every time I washed my hair, it took longer to get it wet.</li>
            <li> As others have noted it is harsh and left mey hair feeling coated and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> This was a tad alarming.  </li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner but found I didn&#x27;t need it, it actually made my hair to heavy and was oily looking before the day was done.</li>
            <li> I contacted Unilever...as expected, \\&quot;the product is tested\\&quot; \\&quot;this is unusual\\</li>
            <li> Im now only using organic shampoo and im drinking green tea and taking biotin supplements to hopefully regrow what i have lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the total care shampoo/conditioner combo for a few weeks now, but I noticed a difference in my scalp almost immediately.</li>
            <li> A few strands extra here and there.</li>
            <li> I will use this product again when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> , it is extremely concentrated, so little shampoo actually has to be used.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, my hair seems a little dry after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> My hair is falling out like crazy and it&#x27;s super dry.</li>
            <li> I stopped using these products only a week and a half ago and have already noticed significantly less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It seemed weird that it took longer than normal to wet my hair, but I brushed it off as a coincidence.</li>
            <li> After one day, my hair goes limp and flat against my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I normally have thick hair that sheds a little</li>
            <li> I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it.</li>
            <li> (I have black curly hair as long as down to my knees.)Now</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t use any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> He suspected thyroid due to the amount of loss.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews it came out in clumps in the shower and while brushing it.</li>
            <li> Also, it contains other ingredients that causes allergic reactions, and does nothing for hair, (Bismuth Oxychloride).  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t even thought about my scalp in the past 2 days that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and that&#x27;s a really big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I had to start shampooing every day instead of every other day, to keep it looking</li>
            <li> The smell, the feel in my hair, how it looked without styling it, everything I could not find from other shampoo products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been two months and my hair has finally stopped shedding excessively.</li>
            <li> I used it once, and I have had an EXTREMELY ITCHY scalp for two weeks now.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been mysteriously falling in handfuls over the past three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to have my hair thinned due to headaches now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely upset by the amount of hair I lost during the use of this product.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m paying the ultimate price of severe hair loss and unbelievable psoriasis and</li>
            <li> it could be due to the shampoo...</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t totally contribute the growth of my hair to the shampoo because I have also been taking 10,000 mcg of Biotin (purchased through Amazon)for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I would use a conditioner also because my ends felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> We saw very little difference between these two products, but they both stand well above the typical shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly, frizz prone hair and this shampoo helped to tame my frizz.</li>
            <li> I just recently discovered that I am not alone and other Clear Head and Scalp users are experiencing the same hair loss along with a burning or painful sensation on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Especially the conditioner&#x27;s since the \\&quot;opening\\&quot; is on the bottom of the &#x27;bottle&#x27; and the product is so thick I can hardly get it out to actually use it.</li>
            <li> and this was scary for me to see how much fell out in the shower and anytime I tried to comb or brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary how much hair I was losing.  </li>
            <li> I was about to schedule a whole bunch of blood work because I thought something was really wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> I really think there is something horribly wrong with this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> the clumps are still coming and I am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo is pale pink</li>
            <li> Hair has slowly seemed to have less falling out, but none is growing back in yet.  </li>
            <li> I laid down to sleep soon after and had to get up</li>
            <li> I also dont believe in trimming my hair because I&#x27;ve always had this dream of growing my hair down to my butt.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out.</li>
            <li> It is now very broken and looks very stringy.  </li>
            <li> and then I noticed that my scalp started to have a slight itch.  </li>
            <li> The biggest change I&#x27;ve noticed is that I am losing so much LESS hair in the shower and in my hairbrush.</li>
            <li> LITERALLY HAVE HALF THE AMOUNT OF HAIR</li>
            <li> I am sad that this product is not what I thought it was, and now my scalp is left itchy, irritable, flaking, and I have a massive jug of both the shampoo and conditioner that I will never use again.</li>
            <li> I quit using it and after a month there seems to be less fall out.</li>
            <li> I just know I have more common sense than this and am so frustrated for not looking into this sooner.  </li>
            <li> I felt a slight tingling and cooling sensation on my scalp.</li>
            <li> For unknown reason this past winter I started losing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick, shiny, long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heavily loaded with silcones, which laminates hair and weighs it down, so you need a shampoo to get it out.  </li>
            <li> As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something!</li>
            <li> it was new and expensive and there were ads everywhere about it.</li>
            <li> that were not clean.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using them I noticed that my hair looked a little funky(I color my hair, and it looked a lot lighter...and somewhat nappy).</li>
            <li> I shampooed every other day for about a week, as usual.</li>
            <li> but I just added a little water</li>
            <li> Im not excited to see the extent of the damage this caused my hair.</li>
            <li> I did a little experiment.</li>
            <li> A little about my hair, it&#x27;s probably been every color under the sun.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on google</li>
            <li> Not just a little, A LOT.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I hate the bottle design.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo/conditioner make my hair fall out in fistfuls, which seems the norm, but it gave me huge bumps on my scalp, terrible itchyness, and greasy hair after one day.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> It brought out the choppy look I like from my layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trouble</li>
            <li> and i dont wanna put up my hair anymore because its obvious i have thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair proceeded to fall off after my hair was dried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is an allergic reaction or if there is something harsh in this product or what.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thin hair...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy or coated.</li>
            <li> and it was after a few months of switching to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product cleared it up just after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Has anyone had luck with regrowth after stopping use for a few months or does the loss appear to be permanent?  </li>
            <li> so when I gradually started losing a few strands here and there, it never crossed my mind</li>
            <li> I know that sounds dramatic but when you have hair so thick that it takes over an hour to blow dry and look in the mirror and see you are practically bald, you would react the same way!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even wear black tops anymore!</li>
            <li> My hair in the past has never been long, in the past year it has grown at least 6 inches.</li>
            <li> A little over a month ago a started losing excessive amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually shed a little bit in the shower or when I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s LOADED with fragrances its one of the first ingrediants as is SLS and silicones which are bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s scalp is practically raw between where his ear meets his scalp.</li>
            <li> I have very long, naturally thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why all the bad reviews, I know a handful of people who use this shampoo and have had no ill effects, including myself.</li>
            <li> I  used Clear shampoo and conditioner for approximately two months until I noticed my hair was broken all the way up to my bangs.  </li>
            <li> I feel bad writing a positive review after seeing some had hair loss with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it once I realized the thinning was due to this shampoo, which was confirmed by all the horrifying reviews I have read!  </li>
            <li> but it got so bad that it really started worrying me.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo then my hair started falling out in handfuls so sad:(</li>
            <li> Do not purchase, unless you want to be hairless in a few months!</li>
            <li> I feel that the product itself is okay, but the container is horrible!</li>
            <li> My scalp is usually irritated and sore, so it calls itself to my attention.</li>
            <li> and I was losing small clumps of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> For the past 5 weeks, (1 week after I started using these products)</li>
            <li> After trying unsuccessfully several expensive products to re grow my hair</li>
            <li> Usually tv commercials don&#x27;t effect my spending habits, but I saw this one</li>
            <li> I tossed them into my workout bag and have used them for the past 9 visits to my</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient does it to me</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> And not just a few strands, but a TON!</li>
            <li> or so I noticed my hair looked a bit greasy towards the end of the day which I don&#x27;t usually have to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will get noticed.</li>
            <li> Devastating results for so many people</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp with scaling.</li>
            <li> I just discovered what this shampoo/conditioner has been doing to me for the past year</li>
            <li> My hair has noticably grown 3 inches over the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> so I didnt think any thing of it and thought it was getting worse due to hormones and age until my husband started complaining</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews normally nor do I write bad reviews but people need to be warned about this product.</li>
            <li> but I was sort of expecting the unpleasant odor of a dandruff shampoo and was pleasantly surprised that the smell was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much so, she was afraid she was going bald!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale and was highly disappointed when it cause my hair to fall out and caused really itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Always steer towards products with LESS ingredients, especially harsh ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did I know, the shampoo was turning my hair hard, because it was drying it out.  </li>
            <li> It would become hard feeling.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly believe what I am reading.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly believe what I was reading.  </li>
            <li> It bordered on giving my hair a dull color.  </li>
            <li> They hide the ingredients under another label that is hard to find.</li>
            <li> But, in this case I felt it was important to let others know of this horrible shampoo.  </li>
            <li> was at least 2 shades lighter...</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative 5 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Well, in this case at least, there is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and perimenopausal, so I thought it was hormones.  </li>
            <li> I know I have lost at least 40 percent of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Read these reviews too late.  </li>
            <li> Made my scalp burn and itch like crazy, all the way to the back of my neck!!</li>
            <li> I found that after using it my scalp itched/burned like crazy and I had constant headaches.</li>
            <li> like with any shampoo and conditioner you have the risk of your scalp and hair reacting negatively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained.</li>
            <li> either it&#x27;s wayyyy to thick.</li>
            <li> so I thought the towels may have been washed with a harsh ingredient or that they may have just been dusty.  </li>
            <li> Also the shampoo is a bit thick</li>
            <li> a has a thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I mean ropes of hair coming out everytime</li>
            <li> Just unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I feel like crying knowing that i&#x27;ve been doing this to my self for close to a year!!</li>
            <li> I mean NOTHING made it go away.</li>
            <li> I mean a lot</li>
            <li> I barely have any hair, and after reading about all the bad reviews here about hair loss, I will never use it ever again.</li>
            <li> It is seriously driving me</li>
            <li> i am in utter  shock with all the bad reviews on here.</li>
            <li> after a few minutes to wash with my normal shampoo because it felt so horrible!!</li>
            <li> My once thick native hair is now weak and thin.</li>
            <li> The shampoo burnt badly when I used it &amp; long after I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> would give it a negative 1,000 if I could!</li>
            <li> It weighed down my hair and took away any shine, leaving it looking dirty.</li>
            <li> I usually have really bad frizzy hair and this shampoo seems to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> LESS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone can tell and my hair had been very thick and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I have always had very thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally impossible to get it to do anything other than what it feels like doing when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Hair is now thin and falling out.</li>
            <li> This really blows my mind because the shampoo was so terrible.</li>
            <li> but it made it so much worse.</li>
            <li> and now my hair is extremely thin.</li>
            <li> Just try and squeeze out the shampoo or conditioner in the shower, poor design that alone would stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> (hey, I have thin hair - I can&#x27;t afford to lose</li>
            <li> I wish I had seen these reviews before because my hair is so thin now</li>
            <li> My hair began to feel so thin</li>
            <li> its horribleeeee!!!.  i was fed up with  my unhealthy scalp  </li>
            <li> and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked to see all of the other reviews about hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Seriously DON&#x27;T USE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and a half, I could not figure out why my hair was falling out so bad.</li>
            <li> but it dried it out so bad.</li>
            <li> The cost of a couple of bottles of this product is hardly compensation for losing my hair!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so thick and luxuriant!!  </li>
            <li> Extreme hair loss and fall out !!!!!!</li>
            <li> plan to return the bottles to the store for a refund and contact the company to let them know how disgusted I am that they continue to sell this crap, knowing full well it is causing hair loss for so many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked to read these negative reviews.</li>
            <li> May have a poor bottle design, but who cares it worked like a miracle for me!</li>
            <li> Something is seriously wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> This was weird.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> Heidi Klum, how could you steer me so wrong?</li>
            <li> I am considering cutting it, but it is so broken all the way up that I would have to shave myself bald.  </li>
            <li> So sorry about others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> so this nourishment is questionable.  </li>
            <li> If I am wrong and I continue to lose hair</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to have itchy scalp forever, since even expensive shampoos didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I thought something was really wrong with me.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin already and can&#x27;t afford to lose anymore!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so insecure about my hair now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is scary.</li>
            <li> I think something is horribly wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry tohear</li>
            <li> It got to the point that I would worry that something was horribly wrong with me.</li>
            <li> how something really is wrong</li>
            <li> i recommend  for  people or are  skeptical  to  give it a try ...</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is really creepy.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the conditioner unfortunately, because my hair is just too oily for it.  </li>
            <li> I feel SO stupid that for the past year I&#x27;ve been going to the doctor worried that there was something seriously wrong with me...</li>
            <li> I have also had my hair dyed, bleached, chemically straightened, etc and never experienced anything that burned as bad as this product.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that the shampoo smells awful and everyone refused to use</li>
            <li> I spoke with my doctors about this, hair dresser it was driving my crazy the amout of hair</li>
            <li> Beauty products are loaded with chemicals and artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been one month since I discontinued use of this deplorable product.</li>
            <li> I even drove myself crazy trying to find out if I had lice.</li>
            <li> , it was crazy.</li>
            <li> So my hairdresser told me it was cutting my scalp, and I stopped using it, and switched to Redkin.</li>
            <li> I started crying thinking how awful it looked and</li>
            <li> but i wash my hair with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;based</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I am unbelievably upset with myself that all along it&#x27;s been this horrible product and</li>
            <li> It has a very faint, almost non existant scent.</li>
            <li> Then it got really bad.</li>
            <li> I have really bad scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> my head is on fire and is itching so bad it has to be from this product.</li>
            <li> So bad my husband had to take the plumming apart and unclog our drains.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand it, one doctor wrote me a prescription for Rogaine because the hair loss was that BAD.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like Head &amp; Shoulders to me, which isn&#x27;t bad, but not a scent I like.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I would have to dust after everywhere</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why there is a lot of bad reviews</li>
            <li> I just hope and pray that we recover from these disastrous affects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to my doctor thinking I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li> Thinking terrible things were wrong with me</li>
            <li> ( I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed</li>
            <li> and I just had to cut it because It was looking so horrible and thin and scraggly!  </li>
            <li> I am so angry!!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help others before they have to suffer from a stupid mistake of using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they still sell this crap.</li>
            <li> I would really hate to see this product go.  </li>
            <li> This was a very scary experience!</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario was that it irritated it just as bad as everything</li>
            <li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t quite as bad as the conditioner to get out, but it&#x27;s all awful.</li>
            <li> but I think its just a bad product!</li>
            <li> It is now to a point that I am almost afraid to wash my hair for rubbing my scalp makes my hair come out!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will look into discussing this issue with the company.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is absurd!!!</li>
            <li> I had horrible hair before I started using this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked to read these negative reviews. I had horrible hair before I started using this product. My hair was damaged and breaking off from dying it and using a flat iron. Literally it was so damaged that it broke off and some of my hair was ear length while the back part was long. This shampoo helped my hair a ton and it finally started growing back, its now shiny, not frizzy, looks a million times better. My hair is long, straight and thin. My daughter also uses it and loves it. She has long, straight, thin hair as well. We won&#x27;t use any other shampoo and conditioner. The smell is wonderful, I never had so many compliments. May have a poor bottle design, but who cares it worked like a miracle for me!</li>
            <li> Hair falling out!! I have used this product for a year now. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair falling out in large clumps. I have very thick hair and this was scary for me to see how much fell out in the shower and anytime I tried to comb or brush. I do not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> First, I will say I have NEVER, EVER written a review of any product in my life!  But, in this case I felt it was important to let others know of this horrible shampoo.  I started using this S&amp;C about 2 months ago.  I have very long, naturally thin hair.  When I first used this it was great!  Smelled nice, and plumped up my hair for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the shedding started.  I mean ropes of hair coming out everytime I touched it.  Had red welts on scalp that were very itchy.  This has been going on for weeks.  Thinking terrible things were wrong with me I went to the Dr. for blood work.  He suspected thyroid due to the amount of loss.  Nope. All results normal.  He suggested I look into what I am using on my head, as I am probably having an allergy to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was when I stumbled on the reviews here.  It appears that I am not the only one with this issue.  It is a relief to know the cause of my hair loss, but I have not used the product in a week and I am still shedding like a dog. When will this end????&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the final effects on my hair will be, but so far I am devastated and will need to cut my long hair due to the extreme damage this product has caused. I will update when the shedding stops, although I see no end in sight. Do not use this shampoo.  And if you have and had a similar reaction, please write a review and let others know. This should be removed from production and a lawsuit should be filed. Just unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I find the comments very interesting.  I started using this product and did start noticing a lot of hair falling out in shower and with the towel I used to dry my hair off.  Now I think I know why.  Also my head started itching awful and so did my body.  I think this shampoo made my head itch and whatever parts of the body it touched.  I&#x27;ve been thinking it is my medications or something in my house but now I am wondering if it&#x27;s the shampoo.  I will definitely stop using it and start back to my L&#x27;Oreal tomorrow.  It will be interesting to see if all these things stop happening. Like the itching and hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo then my hair started falling out in handfuls so sad:(</li>
            <li> Mass breakage from this shampoo.  First it changed the texture of my hair to a rather rough texture.  This was the first thing that I noticed immediately.  My hair actually went from being soft to a rough texture.  Little did I know, the shampoo was turning my hair hard, because it was drying it out.  The shampoo is very drying.  A month later came the breakage.  Especially around the edges.  Very upset &amp; very embarrassed that my hair was missing around the edges.  My hair was thinning before my eyes.  Tried to continue using this product for 3 months, but the breakage continued, so I discontinued usage.  I switched to African Pride 2-1 shampoo conditioner &amp; to my amazement my hair made a complete recovery.  I&#x27;ve been washing and perming my own hair for 45 years &amp; African Pride is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve encountered.  My hair is so soft now with no breakage since discontinuing Clear shampoo.  I hope with all my heart that they keep African Pride 2-1 shampoo conditioner on the market forever.  Clear shampoo needs to be removed from the market permanently, because it&#x27;s truly a rip off.  Ingredients in this product isn&#x27;t suitable for the hair.  The manufacturer is only making money off of it&#x27;s nice fragrance which was why I used it the length of time that I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner after being lured in by the commercials. I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece). That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After using them I noticed that my hair looked a little funky(I color my hair, and it looked a lot lighter...and somewhat nappy). I blew it dry and almost cried. My colored hair(which is normally shiny and sleek) was at least 2 shades lighter...no shine whatsoever, and was gummy:( I was so disappointed. So I would caution any one who is contemplating buying this product, and advise them to pass this one by. It does NOT do what the commercials say it will do, and actually harmed my hair.</li>
            <li> This burned the heck out of my scalp. I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing. What the heck is in here. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well either it&#x27;s wayyyy to thick. It&#x27;s LOADED with fragrances its one of the first ingrediants as is SLS and silicones which are bad for your hair. I&#x27;d totally skip this one. Also this has Zinc Pyrithione which is for dandruff and I think this might have helped cause the burning if you have NO dandruff then use this it has nothing to burn through so to speak. Anyway I&#x27;d def. skip this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and a half, I could not figure out why my hair was falling out so bad. I spoke with my doctors about this, hair dresser it was driving my crazy the amout of hair I was finding everywhere, do laudry and the lint trap would be full of the hair that was on my clothing.  Have not used in about a month the hair is still falling out but hoping with time it will fill back in.  I agree this company needs to have a law suit filed against them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon but feel compelled to do so after using this shampoo/conditioner.  Tried it because it was on sale and I sometimes like trying new things that look promising. Only used this shampoo about three times over the course of a few weeks.  The shampoo burnt badly when I used it &amp; long after I got out of the shower.  My hair also felt unclean and sort of stuck together (couldn&#x27;t comb through it easily), so I didn&#x27;t use it anymore.  Around that time, I noticed that my hair was falling out a lot more than usual, but dismissed it blaming it on the summer heat, something I had done like not getting enough of some nutrient/vitamin, or just random shedding.  I tried not to think much of it but it got so bad that it really started worrying me. My hair would come out in many strands in the shower and was enough to completely cover and clog the drain each time.  When I would brush it the brush was completely covered with hair and during the day I would run my fingers through my hair and get a TON of strands.  It was coming out consistently and I could even notice that its was thinner when I tried to fix it.  My roots I am guessing also became sensitive/sore- even wearing a ponytail hurt!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought the Clear brand shampoo I bought two different kinds of it.  Before even connecting the hair loss (again I&#x27;d only used this a couple of times!) I decided to try the other bottle to see if it did the same thing (just burn, I thought).  In the shower it was fine- afterwards MY HEAD WAS ON FIRE.  I laid down to sleep soon after and had to get up (jump up and run really) after a few minutes to wash with my normal shampoo because it felt so horrible!! I sprayed my scalp with the shower head for like 15-20 full minutes to no avail and I said to myself &#x27;something isnt right here&#x27;.  Started to make the connection and went online to look it up.  The reviews here on Amazon made me sick to my stomach!!  Why is this product still on the shelves?!Why is it advertised on TV?!?!  Something is seriously wrong with this product.  Listen to these reviews- this many people could not be making this up.  This stuff should be sold as a hair removal product!!  But the good news- I have started paying close attention to the products and chemicals I put on my hair.  I&#x27;ve found two excellent and MUCH less harsh shampoos/conditioners- Kiss My Face Big Body &amp; Renpure Originals Argan Oil.  Many of the ingredients are natural and they rinse clean and leave your hair manageable, soft, and shiny.  I&#x27;ve gotten like three compliments just this week on how shiny and pretty my hair looks- if I hadn&#x27;t thrown the Clear in the trash who knows how much hair I would have left?</li>
            <li> I used this product for a long time and after a while my hair dresser told me I had loss of hair at the crown of my scalp. And I wasn&#x27;t even aware of it until she showed me with a mirror.  Then I started to notice my hair thinning and coming out in clumps especially when I brushed it.  After using this product , it never failed that I would get acne of my scalp.and I didn&#x27;t know what was going on thinking  it was from my thyroid , now I know it&#x27;s this shampoo since I stopped using it and the hair loss has stopped and the acne on my scalp.   I&#x27;m in shock, the culprit was right in front of me.  It&#x27;s going in the garbage.  I should have come here to read these reviews first when the hair loss began since I thought it was something else.  This shampoo and conditioner has also thinned my hair out significantly from all the hair loss.  I also noticed that after washing my hair with this product and styling , my hair would turn into straw by the second day.  It would become hard feeling.  Pure poison.  This is an ah ha moment for me.  This is why.  Unbelivable.</li>
            <li> I received the Total Care Nourishing and the Damage and Color Repair shampoos and conditioners for free so I figured these were worth a try.  The first time I used the Nourishing shampoo, I thought this would be my new best friend.  My hair felt soft and fluid.  Then the second time, I developed a rash on the back of my neck.  My skin is sensitive and I was staying at a hotel so I thought the towels may have been washed with a harsh ingredient or that they may have just been dusty.  I continued to use the shampoo a third time and then I noticed that my scalp started to have a slight itch.  This freaked me out and I checked my hair for lice.  I kid you not!  Back home, I went back to my regular Nexxus shampoo and the itching subsided.  I chalked everything up to traveling and to the planes, hotels, etc. that were not clean.  After coloring my roots, I decided to give the Color Repair shampoo a try.  To my surprise, I developed a tiny rash behind both my ears the next morning.  My scalp itch came back, too.  This was weird.  The only thing I had done was wash my hair with different shampoo and conditioner.  But developing a rash twice made me suspicious of the cause and that is when I started to look up reviews for the Clear Scalp and Therapy shampoo line.  I was horrified that many people experienced hair loss and some had rashes.  I almost started to cry.  The neck rash took a week of applying cream and being diligent about keeping the area dry and washing with gentle soap for it to clear.  The ear rashes cleared up in a day.  But how long will it take for my very irritated scalp to go back to normal??  This is horrible.  I am so angry!!</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this product, I thought it was amazing (smelled fantastic and made my hair super soft)...then MY HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT!!! I keep my hair very natural. I do not straighten, blow dry or color it. But even if I run a wide tooth comb through my hair after I get out of the shower, clumps of my hair will fall out from where I brushed it. My friends thought I had a disease cause my hair would fall out throughout the entire day. I got off of this product immediately and switched.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! I decided to give it a chance a few months ago and actually liked it at first (mostly because of the smell). A little over a month ago a started losing excessive amounts of hair. Like other reviews it came out in clumps in the shower and while brushing it. I also had blood work and went to see a dermatologist who discovered that this product was at fault. I wish I would have read the review before trying it. I now have completely damaged scalp and about 50% of the amount of hair I started with. I can not stress this enough DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, you will greatly regret it!!! I just hope the hair loss stops soon!</li>

This shampoo gave my hair a softer feel in just 3 applications. I will be definitely purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Shampoo might actually live up to its advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior citizen with long, thin, fine hair. My usual shampoo cleans my hair just fine. However, the Clear shampoo did much more. The shampoo thickened each strand of hair. Normally it takes at least 15 minutes for me to comb out the tangles. Not with this Clear shampoo. Five minutes after my hair was dry, I had it combed out and braided. Since I&#x27;ve used the shampoo only once, I can&#x27;t tell if it will improve the condition of my scalp as much as it has my hair, but I am eager to discover the effect there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution: If you travel with this shampoo, seal it in a plastic bag. The shampoo was delivered to me in a box containing no other items. In spite of that, the shampoo container managed to leak all over the plastic bag in which it was sealed. The flip-open top on the shampoo bottle cannot be sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t noticed the thinning hair issue as many others have posted but I have noticed skin changes to my scalp and others in my family have had similar complaints. The skin around the back of the ears has become extremely dry and flaky. My dad&#x27;s scalp is practically raw between where his ear meets his scalp. This is definitely not a product I would recommend to others. I will be throwing away my opened bottles and returning the unused shampoo and conditioner (that I bought on sale at Target) immediately.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Do not buy,caused  red burning rash will not go away.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the great smell of lilacs, not too strong but very pleasing. Of the three other brands of shampoo I use, this one left my hair fuller and shinier. I thought it was milder and left my scalp as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as conversant with the chemicals in this product so I defer to the opinions of the other reviewers on that score, but I personally like the results this shampoo produced.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo several months ago, and have been using it every day (shampoo and conditioner. I noticed that when I rinsed my hair, a yarn sized strand of hair would end up coming out. I finally cut it all off, and chalked it up to my age (35). Then it got really bad. Almost bald in front and side! It wasn&#x27;t until I did research, and asked my dermatologist what could be the cause. My 14 year old daughter had been using it as well, and has had a significant amount of hair loss. Not breakage. Root and all comes out!!!!! Do not purchase, unless you want to be hairless in a few months!</li>
            <li> My first thoughts about this product were that is smells AWESOME! I used it for a couple of weeks and no problem my hair smelled lovely and it made it feel really clean. BUT after a couple of weeks I noticed my hair would come out in strands!! Whether I was combing it, washing it or just playing with it. I stopped use of Clear and went back to Herbal Essence (never had a problem with this shampoo) and the strands stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this shampoo is the packaging.  It leaked a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that pretty much has a life of its own.  It&#x27;s literally impossible to get it to do anything other than what it feels like doing when I wake up in the morning.  And while this shampoo didn&#x27;t change that exactly, it did seem to make my hair softer and thus more tractable after about three or four washes with the Clear Scalp conditioner.  Simply put, when I wake up these days, my hair looks pretty respectable and all I have to do is brush it and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I liked the shampoo but the packaging needs a bit of work.</li>
            <li> I was so taken with the commercial for this product that when I found I had a coupon for it I just had to buy it.  Now I&#x27;m sorry I did.  The shampoo totally stripped my hair.  I could have just used dish soap.  Yes, Clear does lather nicely.  But so does Dawn dish detergent!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> I have really long, coarse hair &amp; it&#x27;s a challenge to find products that make it soft without weighing it down or making it greasy feeling. I tried the Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; it&#x27;s wonderful. It smells great, lathers easily (even in hard water) &amp; the conditioner makes my hair soft &amp; I can actually get a comb thru it. I am so glad I tried the Clear products &amp; have since bought them at my local store. Thanks Amazon Vine for bringing Clear into my life.....</li>
            <li> I basically belong to the school that holds that a shampoo is a shampoo and there is the end of the matter. I liked this product. It is a shampoo but I think it is superior. Part of the reason is the packaging. As befits a Unilever product it is solid, the opening and closing of the dispenser is smooth and it feels good to hold since it was probably contoured to fit the human hand. The shampoo itself is pinkish white and about the consistency of Nivea hand lotion. It does a splendid job of cleaning hair and I have less of this item to clean each month. Washes off well and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, liked the fact that it does have an hydrolyzed animal protein. I probably would not write to persons I know endorsing it but would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product make me think that I had lice because I was itching so much, it also made my hair fall out in huge clumps. I paid $50 for my hair to be checked by a professional lice checking company, just to find out that I did not have lice but that my scalp was ridiculously dry and to change my shampoo. Shortly after stopping this and the Clear Conditioner, my head stopped itching and my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore. I contacted the company as I think this product should be pulled off the shelf with so many people having these issues.</li>
            <li> I feel that the product itself is okay, but the container is horrible! Especially the conditioner&#x27;s since the \\&quot;opening\\&quot; is on the bottom of the &#x27;bottle&#x27; and the product is so thick I can hardly get it out to actually use it. The containers are way too large, you can&#x27;t &#x27;squeeze&#x27; them because it&#x27;s a hard plastic, and you can&#x27;t unscrew the top because it isn&#x27;t made that way. The only person who could easily get anything out of them is someone with hands like King Kong.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I&#x27;m shocked to see all of the other reviews about hair falling out. I wish I would have read this sooner so maybe I could save my hair. My hair is falling out in chunks! This should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> Clear shampoo claims to nourish your scalp and thereby your hair. Your hair is not actually absorbing nutrients from your scalp, pleasant as that idea may be. Hair, once it leaves the follicle, is not alive and can&#x27;t eat anything. I was not able to find out exactly what Nutrium 10, the secret ingredient in Clear shampoo, might be. The main ingredients are water and the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate, plus a nice variety of oils including sunflower and coconut oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know about the nourishment of the scalp, but I do know that it leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny. My scalp seems fine, too. This is an economical shampoo, with good results.</li>
            <li> I started with the inexpensive trial sizes that came in a box at Target. From the first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair. The shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic and they leave my hair smelling fantastic for over a day. I never blow dry and I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, so when I let this air dry and my slightly wavy hair turned out with perfect waves and was so smooth and silky feeling. Everything was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to wash my hair again. It seemed weird that it took longer than normal to wet my hair, but I brushed it off as a coincidence. I kept using it, but every time I washed my hair, it took longer to get it wet. So, I went to the store and switched to the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy: Moisturizing Dry Scalp formula. Yeah. When dry, my hair looks, feels, and smells FANTASTIC. But then I go to wash my hair and it&#x27;s like my hair has become water resistant. It takes about ten minutes for my hair to get wet enough to put shampoo in. It&#x27;s horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want your hair to look, feel, and smell fantastic, but in a way that cannot be good for it...at all, then I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT purchase ANY of the Clear shampoo or conditioners!!!!!! Extreme hair loss and fall out !!!!!! Can&#x27;t believe I let this go on for a month.....This is absurd!!! This needs to be taken care of immediately.</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it&#x27;s just a LIE.  A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  I don&#x27;t even use SLS on my hands.  It&#x27;s also heavily loaded with silcones, which laminates hair and weighs it down, so you need a shampoo to get it out.  You might want one conditioner or straightening product with cones, but not your shampoo.  Also, it contains other ingredients that causes allergic reactions, and does nothing for hair, (Bismuth Oxychloride).  Why would you want to stick Bismuth in a shampoo?  In short, steer clear of these products.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed so far. I&#x27;m using the one for colored hair. I have grey hairs that I color frequently because I&#x27;m pretty young, (25) and I work in the beauty industry where image is everything. I also have psoriasis and a very reactive scalp so my hair routine was an endless cycle of: coloring hair -&gt; irritated scalp. Switch off between T-gel and keratin color care shampoo. T-gel -&gt; faded color. Color hair-&gt; irritated scalp. It is seriously driving me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even thought about my scalp in the past 2 days that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and that&#x27;s a really big deal for me. My scalp is usually irritated and sore, so it calls itself to my attention. The shampoo and conditioner felt instantly soothing when I put it on, which was nice, and my scalp feels really clean. If this product does not fade my color quickly I will write another review and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is not my new favorite shampoo. The smell is reminiscent of laundry detergent. It does a decent job of lathering and the smell does not linger after rinsing out, but I&#x27;d rather use something a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product provides a light cleansing and does not leave a build-up. It smells good, and leaves a \\&quot;just-right\\&quot; scent afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> A good shampoo that cleans and protects your hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shampoo (and it&#x27;s companion conditioner)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good products for hair care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate \\&quot;CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce\\&quot;...4 stars!</li>
            <li> I did not care for the texture of this shampoo, or the way it felt during use or after.  As others have noted it is harsh and left mey hair feeling coated and unnatural.  I prefer a more gentle and natural product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the drug store one day when I noticed the prominent display. I have thick, salt and pepper hair that I wear short and very layered. My hair has always been one of my best features, and believe me, as one ages one is thankful to retain whatever good features one has! Generally, unless I use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;agree\\&quot; with it, my hair looks and behaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first several times I used this shampoo I loved it! I shampooed every other day for about a week, as usual. This product seemed to clear the oil from my hair very well, and made it manageable. It brought out the choppy look I like from my layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that all lasted only for that first week. As I continued using it, my hair felt dirtier and oilier more quickly, and my scalp began to itch. My hair started looking flat after shampooing, like it was weighed down. I had to start shampooing every day instead of every other day, to keep it looking clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks use, I gave up. My scalp itched and developed tiny scabs, as another commenter reported. I stopped using Clear and went back to Pantene and Jhirmack. I had to use a clarifying shampoo several days in a row to wash out whatever residue that stuff had left that had really weighed down my hair. (Although I didn&#x27;t check the ingredients, I&#x27;m guessing it was silicone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all. It was a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall out. Not patches, just gradual and in significant amounts.Hair is now thin and falling out. Went to doctor, they advised to stop using it for a while and see if hair loss decreases and it did. Bummer there are so many harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny reading all the reviews that say their hair was falling out.  I guess you have to use the shampoo that works for YOU.  My wife has been using the Clear Total Care Shampoo and Conditioner for 6 months now, and she raves about it!  She has long thick black Asian hair, but most shampoos (like Pantene) make it fall out in mass -- so much so, she was afraid she was going bald!  But this is the first shampoo set that she&#x27;s used where she barely loses a single strand from washing!  Her hair is now ultra thick and so healthy.  So she made me go write a good review because she&#x27;s afraid they&#x27;ll stop making this shampoo for her to buy if they only listened to the complainers. Lol.</li>
            <li> Purchased the shampoo and conditioner after reading all the hype in magazines.  Been using Bed Head products from my hair salon prior.  After 1 week using this I noticed my hair felt thinner and could feel more of my scalp!  This was a tad alarming.  My hair went to feeling somewhat healthy (highlight my hair so has some processing stress but not much) to feeling unhealthy.  Texture was changed.  Also noticed the color looked washed out after using.  Products going in garbage can and back to shampoos/conditioners from salon!</li>
            <li> Like so many of the previous reviewers, this shampoo was VERY harsh and had adverse effects. At first, the shampoo left my hair so soft and manageable. However, within a few weeks of regular use, I started to notice some redness and itchiness in my scalp and also MUCH more hair falling out than usual. Apparently, it is normal to lose 50 or even 100 hairs a day, so this was hard to notice at first. But eventually, it seemed like the hairs were coming out by the dozen! It was really upsetting and I do NOT recommend this to anyone. Maybe I am particularly sensitive, but it seems like several customers have had the same problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to use this because Allure Magazine rated it the &amp;#34;Best Shampoo&amp;#34; for 2012. This really blows my mind because the shampoo was so terrible. This is why customer reviews are so important as opposed to the opinion of one magazine or one &amp;#34;expert.&amp;#34; I hope this helps out anyone considering to purchase this shampoo so that you do not have to go through the trouble of repairing your scalp and hair from this harsh product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discovering the ugly truth about this shampoo, I threw it away and started searching for a gentle shampoo to make my hair and scalp healthy again. I found a lot of information online about sulfate-free shampoos, which are more gentle than the majority of shampoos out there. Many people are allergic to sulfates and they don&#x27;t even know it. I decided to try Aveeno&#x27;s Pure Renewal Sulfate-Free shampoo and I have been MUCH more satisfied than with the Clear shampoo. As it turns out, the fancy award winning products do not work for everyone. The lessons I learned are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Beauty products are loaded with chemicals and artificial ingredients. Always steer towards products with LESS ingredients, especially harsh ones.&lt;br /&gt;2. Always read customer reviews before buying anything! The internet is full of useful information, so why not use it!&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not trust products advertised in magazines until you do your research!</li>
            <li> I have really bad scalp psoriasis.  I switched to wen after my first flare, because it was natural, but even some of the natural ingredients caused me issues.  Since the whole premise behind this product line is scalp health, and I obviously don&#x27;t have a healthy one, I decided to give this a try.  Worst case scenario was that it irritated it just as bad as everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff!  First of all, the massive hair loss and breakage I had has stopped.  Secondly, my plaques are not nearly as heavy as normal, and I don&#x27;t have as much itching.  It also doesn&#x27;t burn on application!  I will be a permanent CLEAR user from now on.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt anything that my hair is softer and shinier than it has been since the P showed up!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I received some coupons from the company to get two free bottles. At first I was IN LOVE with Clear. My hair was soft and shiny, and it smelled amazing. After a while, I noticed my hair started breaking and I was losing small clumps of hair in the shower. I am a 21 year old girl that has long, thick hair. I work retail, and I&#x27;ve been finding my hair falling out on customers&#x27; bags. My hair is falling out like crazy and it&#x27;s super dry. It feels gross. I used to have soft, shiny hair, but now it&#x27;s dry with a hint of grease or something. I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo/conditioner make my hair fall out in fistfuls, which seems the norm, but it gave me huge bumps on my scalp, terrible itchyness, and greasy hair after one day.  Oh, and my hair started breaking and tearing.  I had a halo of frizz around my head.  Heidi Klum, how could you steer me so wrong?</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner.  Immediately after getting out of the shower, my scalp burned like fire.  It should come with a warning label.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best drug store shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I love Biolage but can&#x27;t always afford it. I decided to try this on a whim and after a couple months I&#x27;ve been really pleased. It smells really good, and has completely cleared up my chronic dandruff. The biggest change I&#x27;ve noticed is that I am losing so much LESS hair in the shower and in my hairbrush. I used to take handfuls of hair out while washing (I have really long hair) and now it&#x27;s virtually none. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my hair still gets pretty oily the day after washing so it hasn&#x27;t helped with that.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative 5 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers, at first I thought I really liked the shampoo and conditioner. My hair was softer, shinier and more manageable. And I liked the clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then my hair started looking oily, yet dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Then the hair loss began. For the past 5 weeks, (1 week after I started using these products) my hair has been falling out in clumps when showering, filling my hairbrush and I can run my fingers through my hair and literally pull out handfuls without applying any pressure with my fingers. My hair is everywhere! My car, clothes, dryer lint trap, vanity, floors and furniture. (I can run my hand across my couch and gather a handful.)&lt;br /&gt;I LITERALLY HAVE HALF THE AMOUNT OF HAIR I HAD 5 WEEKS AGO, OR LESS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone can tell and my hair had been very thick and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, I have been to 2 doctors and had numerous blood test done to see what may have been wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful I decided to check out reviews on these products tonight! Since all blood work was normal, I feel confident I have diagnosed the problem here.&lt;br /&gt;I pray my hair grows back in after discontinuing use of this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to return the bottles to the store for a refund and contact the company to let them know how disgusted I am that they continue to sell this crap, knowing full well it is causing hair loss for so many.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT LINE!!!!</li>
            <li> (Note:  This review is mostly the same as the one for its sister product, Volumizing Root Boost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same. Well, in this case at least, there is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I tested this shampoo as well as its sister product, Total Care Volumizing Root Boost. We saw very little difference between these two products, but they both stand well above the typical shampoo. Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going. When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue. I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat. Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate. My wife also reported that with this shampoo, she felt no need to use conditioner. The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that other one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight. But we expect to give up our practice of buying the cheapest shampoos and will purchase one of these in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shampoo, it leaves your hair clean and feeling moist even when wet. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair that squeaky dry feeling when wet like after using a clarifying shampoo yet it cleans very well. I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles. When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day. My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn&#x27;t do that at all. I tried the conditioner but found I didn&#x27;t need it, it actually made my hair to heavy and was oily looking before the day was done. I use this shampoo alone and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so thick and luxuriant!!  The scent is very clean and my hair feels so soft after using.  This shampoo is a great addition to my hair care regimen!  I have curly hair and this shampoo helps me keep the frizzies at bay.  Just wash, apply leave in conditioner and let it air dry.  The result has been good hair days again.  I am a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> Used this 2 times first week of July.  Hair has been falling out profusely ever since.  My scalp is dry and itchy which has never been before. Am hoping this will end soon as I only used this twice..extremely traumatizing, I had beautiful hair before this happened..I may contact the maker to ask what to do and if they know how to make it stop.</li>
            <li> Bought it at the drugstore after Heidi convinced me to on tv. I was really disappointed but I should have known better, great things rarely come with a price tag of $4...maybe it&#x27;s just my hairs chemistry did not mesh well with whatever is in this shampoo but it dried it out so bad. I do have highlighted hair but pretty damn healthy thanks to joico and redeken. It made my hair elasticy and when I would come after the shower my hair was literally stretching. I used for about a week and then I put in the cabinet to use for the dogs.</li>
            <li> My roommate is a stylist and is always bringing me different salon quality shampoos and conditioners to try. I usually like them, but not enough to go out of my way to buy/request more of. I tried this on a whim- I swear I&#x27;m so susceptible to hair product marketing. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Its my favorite. My hair feels clean, light and healthy all day. I have very long think hair, so often shampoos weigh it down or cause me to spend way too long trying to rinse it out of my hair. I&#x27;ve bought three bottles so far, which is a lot for a compulsive tester of new products.</li>
            <li> I hope that you&#x27;re reading these reviews BEFORE deciding to use this product! I checked them only after my hair began to fall out! I have long, but fine hair and once it started to fall it was a nighmare. The bottom of the shower had long strands (not breakage...full strands...from the root) all over it every time I showered. Combing through my hair when wet resulted in a comb FULL of hair and once dried and styled, there were still strands falling all over the house and sticking to my clothes...my hair was everywhere! I consulted my doctor. He did some blood work and turned up nothing...no medical reason for this to be happening. This is when I finally put two and two together and started to do some online research on this product. My jaw dropped...the same thing has been happening to many users. I contacted Unilever...as expected, \\&quot;the product is tested\\&quot; \\&quot;this is unusual\\&quot; \\&quot;we can offer you your money back\\&quot; blah...blah...blah!! My money back!?! Really!?! The cost of a couple of bottles of this product is hardly compensation for losing my hair!! With this many complaints of the same issue, at some point don&#x27;t you think that they might say \\&quot;hmmm...perhaps there is an issue here\\&quot;?!? Anyway...it&#x27;s been one month since I discontinued use of this deplorable product. My hair is STILL falling, but the amount of loss is starting to lessen thankfully. I&#x27;ve lost about 25% of my hair and it will take years to regrow what&#x27;s been lost. Everytime I see the Clear commercial, I want to punch Heidi Klum in the face! Please do not use this product and if you are using it...run, don&#x27;t walk, away from it! You may be one of the users that doesn&#x27;t have an issue, but with so many other products ot there it certainly isn&#x27;t worth the risk! Unilever shoud be ashamed!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this shampoo because it was on sale, and based on the television ads.  At first, I liked the product, but within two weeks, I started losing handfuls of hair.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s and perimenopausal, so I thought it was hormones.  My hairdresser even mentioned that my hair was thinner and drier than normal.  I checked with my naturopath, who suggested conditioning my hair with coconut and rosemary oil.  It didn&#x27;t help.  I decided to stop using the shampoo and go back to my regular brand, Pantene.  The hair loss has stopped, and my hair is now softer and not as dry.  I used the Clear Scalp and Hair therapy shampoo and conditioner every two days before, but now I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner every time.  I decided to check the reviews, and was shocked that so many people have had the same problem, so I felt compelled to write this review.  It seems to work for some people, but it was a disaster for me!</li>
            <li> I have lost 50% of my hair. I have a receding hairline now. I&#x27;m so upset this product has DESTROYED MY HAIR PERMANENTLY. I went to my doctor thinking I&#x27;m sick. Everything was perfect.  Then i figured it out. It&#x27;s this product. Please do not buy this product.  PLEASE!!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally greasy thin straight hair. Started using this product close to a year ago and noticed I was having severe hair loss and it appeared that I had dandruff. I have NEVER had dandruff. I was pulling hair out in clumps in the shower, after brushing, and anytime I would even touch my scalp. I have thyroid problems, so I went to the doctor and had everything checked out. All was normal, but my hair kept falling out. Recently switched a couple of months back to the natural Herbal Essence line with no parabens and noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore. However, it did appear greasy once again, so I switched back to Clear. Been using it for a week, and SO MUCH HAIR LOSS. Saw all of the reviews on here, and it confirmed my suspicions. DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was appealing with it&#x27;s fresh smell and decent price point. That&#x27;s where the appeal stopped. I used this product for about 4 months before developing itching and losing hair rapidly. My hair is already fine so losing more really stinks. To top it all off, I then developed a rash like dematitis in my head with little pus filled bumps. I stopped using this shampoo and conditioner  and went back to Pantene. It&#x27;s getting better (the rash) but I am still suffering. The design of the bottle also leaves much to be desired....in my opinion--this product should never be used.</li>
            <li> For unknown reason this past winter I started losing my hair. After trying unsuccessfully several expensive products to re grow my hair I decided to try out this shampoo. One month after I started using this shampoo my hair became healthier, shinier and I also notice that several baby hair was coming from the hair line.&lt;br /&gt;After a serious research of this shampoo ingredients I read that zinc helps to stop help lost and in in most cases help to regrowth hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use tea tree oil at night and then in the morning I washed my hair with clear shampoo and apply Clear conditioner.  I love my new long, thicker and shiny hair</li>
            <li> I  used Clear shampoo and conditioner for approximately two months until I noticed my hair was broken all the way up to my bangs.  I noticed the breakage first and quit using the product.  My hair was very long and fine, but thick. After I discontinued the product, I noticed the hair loss which continues three weeks following my discontinuing the product.  It is now very broken and looks very stringy.  I know I have lost at least 40 percent of my hair.  I am considering cutting it, but it is so broken all the way up that I would have to shave myself bald.  I am just heartbroken, as it took me years to grow it out to this length.  As I am about to turn 59, I doubt I will ever have the opportunity to have long pretty hair again.  Please...if you love your hair, don&#x27;t use this product!</li>
            <li> It is with great sadness that I say that these reviews of hair loss are true. I have been using this shampoo for a year and I thought it was great. Recently though my hair loss has become a source of concern. I just recently discovered that I am not alone and other Clear Head and Scalp users are experiencing the same hair loss along with a burning or painful sensation on the scalp. I believe that the word needs to get out so that others don&#x27;t suffer as I have. PLEASE DON&#x27;T USE!!! It&#x27;s likely that with time, continued use of this shampoo will do damage. I wish I had been warned or that I had done my research.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product from the day I bought it: The smell, the feel in my hair, how it looked without styling it, everything I could not find from other shampoo products. I do not have allergies to anything at all, and this product has given me awful cradle cap. It itches and itches and flakes of dandruff are always present, starting after about 3 months of continuous use. I am sad that this product is not what I thought it was, and now my scalp is left itchy, irritable, flaking, and I have a massive jug of both the shampoo and conditioner that I will never use again. I am very disappointed and will look into discussing this issue with the company. I would advise not to get this product until it is reformulated or something is changed.</li>
            <li> I feel bad writing a positive review after seeing some had hair loss with this shampoo. I can only speak for myself but this shampoo and conditioner changed my life. Before use I battled with the worst flakey scalp. Nothing worked and it was very embarrassing! Since I&#x27;ve started with this product my scalp has completely healed. Smells awesome and is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  The bottles do suck but manageable. Also the shampoo is a bit thick but I just added a little water and it&#x27;s perfect now. So sorry about others trouble I totally disagree. Maybe your hair type makes a difference: my hair is very thick, coarse and naturally wavy. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale and was highly disappointed when it cause my hair to fall out and caused really itchy scalp. I wonder what ingredient is causing this!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! makes hair smell fragrant for hours! I love this stuff! It makes my  damaged hair soft. It works I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Strong lingering fragrance which doesn&#x27;t rinse out.  After 5 minutes, went back to wash my hair again with Castille soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) because there was a 6 foot radius of smelly floral (cheap) scent surrounding me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample locally and tossed it after one try.  Nicest thing to say about it is the design of the container.  Also contains the laurel this and laurel that are are used for cleaning garage floors, so the soap part is very strong.  Long list of chemicals that no one needs near their skin.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything different from other corporate shampoos - except worse smell than many.</li>
            <li> The combination if this shampoo and conditioner has caused my hair to fall out! I usually shed a little bit in the shower or when I brush my hair. But after just three weeks of using this product I have a fist full of hair in my hand after I shower!! Plus it continues to fall out during the day. My scalp is very itchy as well. I stopped using it a week ago and my hair is still falling out. Thankfully the itching has stopped so hopefully the hair loss will stop soon. Im not excited to see the extent of the damage this caused my hair. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAMPOO!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-06-13&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two months and my hair has finally stopped shedding excessively. I had blood work done just to make sure nothing was wrong with me. It was all normal! This product was the only different thing I had been doing. Seriously DON&#x27;T USE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I started using this last year some time and have noticed that my hair has been falling out in large clumps.  I went to have my hair trimmed and was asked what shampoo I used and was told that I should be using a protein shampoo.  After thinking about this, I thought that&#x27;s probably the cause.  I think this shampoo strips the protein out of your hair, causing it to fall out.  It&#x27;s scary how much hair I was losing.  I have quit using this shampoo for almost one week and have noticed a little bit of a difference in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing, but I&#x27;m sure it will take time.  BUYER BEWARE with this purchase.</li>
            <li> my head is on fire and is itching so bad it has to be from this product. i have dry scalp to begin with and was hoping this would help but it made it so much worse.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this shampoo and started noticing a tremendous amount of hair loss. I have always had very thick hair and now my hair is extremely thin. I even went to my dr to make sure nothing was wrong but all my tests came back normal. It made my hair shiny and soft but the hair loss is not worth it. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I got dooped. Usually tv commercials don&#x27;t effect my spending habits, but I saw this one and I bought this shampoo/conditioner combo when I ran out.  I used it once, and I have had an EXTREMELY ITCHY scalp for two weeks now.  I read the other reviews, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra hair falling out (I shed hair a lot anyway.) I do have dandruff on a regular basis, but it&#x27;s not itchy.  Immediately after using this product, I had scabs in my head and I am still itching two weeks later! Beware of using this!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is OK but the fragrance is a little too strong.  It lingers even after washing with another shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has been mysteriously falling in handfuls over the past three weeks.  About half way through the bottle I stopped using Clear because it was drying out my hair and giving me severe dandruff.  It didn&#x27;t click that Clear was the source of my hair loss until I realized that as soon as I stopped using it I saw an improvement.  I googled the reviews for this product today and I am shocked to find so many people with the same experience.  I am so upset!  I have always had thick, shiny, long hair and I just had to cut it because It was looking so horrible and thin and scraggly!  I was about to schedule a whole bunch of blood work because I thought something was really wrong with me.  I really think there is something horribly wrong with this shampoo and conditioner.  This company needs to discontinue this product.  Horrible!  I really hope my hair bounces back!</li>
            <li> At first I truly loved this product. Smelled great worked well. Then about a month ago I noticed a lot of hair everywhere. So bad my husband had to take the plumming apart and unclog our drains. I naturally thought it was my Metformin medications. Then I started researching this product.....well after many serious reviews and complaints I will be immediately throwing this garbage where it belongs. I&#x27;ve had numerous blood work done thinking it was my diabetes or my thyroid. Guess what? Blood work came back great. I used to have to have my hair thinned due to headaches now...no so much! Hopefully I can reverse this. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> At first, Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty shampoo and conditioner seemed to be wonderful.  My hair turned shiny and very manageable, almost immediately after beginning its use. But when people at work started picking hair off my clothes, I started noticing my hair was falling out in large quantities. Sadly, I had fine, thin hair to begin with and didn&#x27;t have this kind of hair to lose!  I started searching for reasons in my diet, and then realized the hair loss began shortly after changing hair care products.  I stopped using these products only a week and a half ago and have already noticed significantly less hair loss.  I&#x27;m extremely upset by the amount of hair I lost during the use of this product.  Hopefully the manufacturer will take complaints about their product seriously enough to change the formula to prevent this from continuing with other consumers.</li>
            <li> I loved the product when I bought it. Soft, silky hair and great smell. After a month or so I started losing a lot of hair. I just saw dermatologist who said my scalp is red and irritated. This is the only new product I was using. Even though I stopped using it about a month ago my hair is still falling out. Hoping Clobex prescribed by dermatologist will help.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like a conditioner .. it feels like straight shampoo, not much in suds .. I&#x27;m not impressed.  My hair is DRY because I dye it .. so this nourishment is questionable.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and I thought this would be helpful in clearing it up. WRONG! Not only did it inflame my hands, shoulders, back, etc but my scalp actually cracked open and bled like I was stabbed in the head. Now I&#x27;m paying the ultimate price of severe hair loss and unbelievable psoriasis and now even my $40,000 a year medication is not working. How are they getting away with this?!?!?!!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product at first, but then my hair started falling out (A LOT). My stylist took a look at it and said it wasn&#x27;t falling out, but breaking off! I obviously discontinued use, but she said it will take a month to see a full improvement. Proceed with caution if you plan to try this product!</li>
            <li> So I must be honest I came here to give a rave review about how I love this shampoo and it smwlla so great until I read through previous reviews where people are saying it is making their hair fall out. I have honestly been losing alot if hair but I just thought it was due to natural shedding. Although now that I think about it I have been losing more than I ever remember. I am going to stop using clear and see if the hair loss remains. For now I will give it 3 stars. If I am wrong and I continue to lose hair I will adjust it accordingly.</li>
            <li> When i first bought this shampoo, it was because i had a coupon for buy one and get one free. It was new and i was looking for a product to tame my frizzy curls. I used Clear shampoo and the conditioner and for months i used it because i liked how it made my hair look. Nice and styled curls that were bouncey. So i kept buying it but over a month ago, i noticed i had been losing a lot of hair! Always hair in my hand when i would just simply comb my hair with my fingers. Its embarrassing to have hair all over your sholders. My boss would tease me and say &amp;#34;you shedding&amp;#34; i laughed and brushed it off as normal. But now my hair has thinned so much that i see my scalp and i dont wanna put up my hair anymore because its obvious i have thin hair. I feel like crying knowing that i&#x27;ve been doing this to my self for close to a year!! Im so thankful for these amazon reviewers that lead me to the conclusion that Clear hair products will make your hair fall out! I feel like sueing the company if only i knew how! Im only 22!! I shouldnt have to worry about becoming bald! Im now only using organic shampoo and im drinking green tea and taking biotin supplements to hopefully regrow what i have lost. Beautiful thick hair is what gives every woman confidence...how dare this company just sit back and allow for their product to do such horrible things to people. Pleeease! I urge whomever is reading this to please not buy any Clear hair products! There&#x27;s some chemical in them that will make your hair fall out rapidly!</li>
            <li> The best I have used.</li>
            <li> There should be a Class Action Lawsuit against the manufacturer of the Clear Brand!!! DO NOT USE! I USE to HAVE Tons of Hair; people were jealous at how much hair I had but NOT so much now. I started using the Clear Shampoo and Conditioner about 2 years ago, YES 2 yrs, that&#x27;s how much hair I had so much that it took nearly a year for me to notice that I was loosing my hair. I too went to doctors; 2 in fact, had blood work done, came out normal. I couldn&#x27;t understand it, one doctor wrote me a prescription for Rogaine because the hair loss was that BAD. I am going bald!!! I decided to look up the reviews on this brand and noticed so many people, approximately 75% were complaining of hair loss. There is another site with reviews (makeupalley). I will never use it again. I don&#x27;t know if my hair will grow back.</li>
            <li> I had the worst allergic reaction to this product I&#x27;ve ever had.  Welts all over that didn&#x27;t go away for months.  Gave it away to a family member and the same thing happened to her.  I don&#x27;t write reviews normally nor do I write bad reviews but people need to be warned about this product.</li>
            <li> It seems like all the shampoos out there right now are so moisturizing that they make your hair greasy right away.  This one didn&#x27;t do that and left my hair shiny and with lots of body.  I would use a conditioner also because my ends felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, below shoulder length hair.  My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell&lt;br /&gt;I got both the shampoo and conditioner through the Vine program to try out.  I tossed them into my workout bag and have used them for the past 9 visits to my gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  It seems quite concentrated and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing to be able to use less.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner feels thick and smooth.  It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  I wouldn&#x27;t call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  It doesn&#x27;t seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well and my hair felt silky and slippery (just the way I like it after a shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry and curl the ends later.  I never blow-dry.  These products are excellent in the fact that I didn&#x27;t have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  Nice to touch and comb.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use.... hopefully for the good.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I like both these products.  They smell really great, and the price is very good for what they do.  I may update this review when I get to the bottom of the bottles.</li>
            <li> JUST AWFUL!!!  It got me too, in that my hair is noticeably thinner after using it just once.  Read these reviews too late.  Ugh.  Has anybody noticed yet whether your hair has eventually grown back or regained it&#x27;s normal thickness after throwing this rat poison in the trash?  Is there hope??</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe what I am reading.  I had been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for about a year. I received some samples of it and used them while traveling and loved the way it made my hair look and feel, so I switched and began using it daily.  About 6 months ago, I noticed that I was losing a significant amount of hair at the crown of my head and along my hairline.  I normally have fine but very thick blond hair, and now my scalp was showing a LOT around my part and all around the crown.  My hair also seemed to be getting very dry and brittle and actually getting lighter.  Thinking back, I was noticing more hair coming out in the shower because I had to start keeping it from going down the drain.  I switched back to my Aquage shampoo and conditioner just to try to heal my hair. Having hypothyroidism, I thought maybe my thyroid medicine needed to be adjusted and went to the doctor.  She noticed the hair loss immediately and suggested I go to a dermatologist and endocrinologist. Thyroid tests came back completely normal. Iron and ferritin completely normal.  Dermatologist said it could be hereditary hair loss and prescribed Rogaine and Spirinolactone. I also began using several supplements as well.  I was devastated. My hair has always been my best feature and I used to receive compliments daily.  Even my hair stylist would remark every time she cut it how amazingly healthy my hair was.  No more.  Hair has slowly seemed to have less falling out, but none is growing back in yet.  Looking for answers, on a long shot I looked up Clear shampoo reviews since that was one thing that had changed leading up to the significant hair loss.  I could hardly believe what I was reading.  I guess I have found the cause.  Now I just hope it comes back.  I have easily lost over 50% of the hair at my crown.  I can no longer wear my hair up or in a ponytail because when I pull it back it shows so much scalp.  I can&#x27;t believe that for how long these reviews have been coming in, this product is still sold. This never had to happen. I would be interested in a class action lawsuit.  I am paying a huge amount of money for medications. supplements, and products to try to undo the damage, and I don&#x27;t even know at this point if it can be undone.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I experienced severe itchiness from using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t *think* I had hair loss, but it&#x27;s possible I lost a little more than usual. But definitely itchiness was a problem - it felt like my head was literally on fire. I even drove myself crazy trying to find out if I had lice. Ditched the shampoo and all was back to normal.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my hair after using the product!  HOWEVER, if I continue to use this product I WON&#x27;T have any hair!!!!!!!  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! My hair is falling out by the handfuls after about a month of using this product! TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE MARKET!</li>
            <li> I received the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty nourishing shampoo and have been using it as needed.  I do not wash my hair every day - only 2 or 3 times per week.  My hair has been color treated and tends to be very fine and limp.  This shampoo only gives me one day of good looking, clean hair.  After one day, my hair goes limp and flat against my scalp.  I think this is due to having been moisturized too much by the shampoo.  I think I&#x27;m going back to regular old anti-dandruff shampoo.  This shampoo smells nice and lathers well, it just doesn&#x27;t do my hair or scalp much good.  If you were to have dry hair or very thick hair, this shampoo should be wonderful for you.</li>
            <li> I reviewed both the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; shampoo and the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; conditioner.  Several other members of my family tried these products as well.  Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  Not only did it lather properly, it is extremely concentrated, so little shampoo actually has to be used.  Both my wife and I also found that if one used the shampoo daily, the conditioner was needed only on an every two-or-three day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will become a staple in our household.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this shampoo (no conditioner), and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed: not much. I&#x27;m not a big shampoo person. I use shampoo, of course, but I generally buy whatever&#x27;s cheapest. Prior to this bottle, I used Suave at $1 a pop. I don&#x27;t have especially problematic hair, I keep it short, and there is no artificial coloring to worry about. So I don&#x27;t need much shampoo or much from a shampoo, and this bottle lasted a while. To the extent that I noticed differences, they included: This shampoo is more viscous than other shampoos, so I was able to use less; this shampoo did leave my hair wetter longer after showering, noticeably so; that&#x27;s is, though. I had neither the problems that others have had nor any particular benefits other than clean hair that any shampoo could deliver.</li>
            <li> This gets rid of itchy scalp that I sometimes get after I visit the hair stylist. I am sensitive to some of the products they use there. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient does it to me but I suspect that now, since they often include some sort of botanical essence or extract in so many products, that some sort of essential oil, possibly lavendar oil, may be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever causes it, this gets rid of it. This really foams up as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried. It really does a thourough cleaning job of the scalp without stripping the hair of moisture. It also left my hair very shiney and full of life. It has a very faint, almost non existant scent. Would I buy this again? Absolutely. I also love the conditioner that goes with this. If I didn&#x27;t already have about twenty shampoos, I would buy a bottle of this immediately. Oh heck, I&#x27;m adding it to my cart anyway since it&#x27;s so inexpensive here.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great after I go swimming, to get the salt and chlorine out of my hair. I love great hair products and this one is definitely great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and am about to complete my second bottle. This is an excellent shampoo, in my opinion. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shinier than it has ever been. I find that if I use the shampoo in conjunction with the corresponding conditioner that I am able to easily pass a comb thru my wet hair, which is not the case at all with other products. Hopefully they will release some corresponding styling products in the near future. In the past I have also not been able to use the same shampoo brand for an extended period of time for some reason. I have not had this problem with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was the WORST shampoo ever! I bought it b/c it was new and expensive and there were ads everywhere about it. I saw after like 2 uses ALL my hair was falling out in STRIPS. It was HORRIBLE. I cut my hair short thinking that it would get better and it just got worse. (I have black curly hair as long as down to my knees.)Now I barely have any hair, and after reading about all the bad reviews here about hair loss, I will never use it ever again. I cut my hair for no reason like 3 feet. That makes me the most upset. I really hope that it goes back to normal soon. One piece of advice: NEVER BUY THIS EVER!</li>
            <li> My hair also began to fall out and I just thought it was hormones.  When I saw my 20 year old son&#x27;s hair getting thinner I connected the dots.  He had the most beautiful thick hair and now I FEEL TERRIBLE GUILT OVER BUYING THIS SHAMPOO!!! I just hope and pray that we recover from these disastrous affects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stop production of this detriment to society!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a negative 1,000 if I could!</li>
            <li> I received this in a subscription box recently and although I have only used it twice something about it makes me nervous. It smells a lot like Head &amp; Shoulders to me, which isn&#x27;t bad, but not a scent I like. It makes my scalp tingle, I have never used anything that makes my scalp tingle and I don&#x27;t quite like the feeling. It gives me headaches. Both times I have used this I have gotten a headache (I&#x27;m in no way prone to headaches, only if I have a rare hangover).  After reading the reviews where hair is falling out I am over it and won&#x27;t pass it along to a friend like I normally do because it seems this system has something fishy going on with it.</li>
            <li> I used a trial sample tonight, and significant amount of hair fell off from my scalp in the shower. My hair proceeded to fall off after my hair was dried. The chemicals are too strong in the shampoo and conditioner. I have never had this problem in my life. Terrible product!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because some members of our family have easily irritated scalps.  We were very disappointed.  First, the bottle indicates that the scalp benefits are only indicated when the conditioner is also used, so I bet the shampoo does little or nothing to help your scalp.  The other thing is that the shampoo smells awful and everyone refused to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It might help your scalp, but only if you use the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Have to use the condition to get scalp benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo because I have always had \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; scalp, but no dandruff. I knew I needed healthier scalp, so I figured I&#x27;d try Clear, since it was inexpensive enough. I love it! I&#x27;ve been using the total care shampoo/conditioner combo for a few weeks now, but I noticed a difference in my scalp almost immediately. I have very wavy and frizzy hair, and this has really helped to tame it.  No, it won&#x27;t make your hair so perfect that you don&#x27;t need a styling tool, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to do that. It feels silkier (NOT oily) and smells so good. I have tried every shampoo/conditioner under the sun, and this is hands down my favorite. I thought I was doomed to have itchy scalp forever, since even expensive shampoos didn&#x27;t help. Thanks to Clear, my hair is so much more manageable, smells delicious, and my scalp feels great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line and the shine/scalp improvement I get by using it, but alas, I cannot spend as much as I used to on haircare. I wanted something affordable that gave me the same results. I have tried it ALL, Garnier (the entire line), Pantene, Sauve...and finally this came to the market, so I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; FINALLY! I love this stuff.  I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing (the scent lasts into the next day).  I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It has a very light scent, completely unobtrusive. It cleans thoroughly, but leaves my hair both soft and manageable, with a nice sheen. It both lathers well and rinses out completely. What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> At first I thought this shampoo was great because it made my hair soft and made it easy for me to comb through my long hair, but while in the shower and running the conditioner through my hair, clumps of hair would end up in my hands. It was unbelievable. DO NOT use this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I got this product in a trial from Target and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I used it one night and it left my hair very silky and smooth, and it smelled great. I was planning on going out and buying it the next day. That was until I woke up with the driest, itchiest scalp I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I don&#x27;t know if it is an allergic reaction or if there is something harsh in this product or what. I have never had dry scalp issues before. I&#x27;ve since washed my hair twice with the normal shampoo, and my scalp still feels incredibly dried out and itchy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started using this and loved it but I have noticed my hair is getting thinner. I would like to know who invented the bottle they use. Just try and squeeze out the shampoo or conditioner in the shower, poor design that alone would stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this shampoo/conditioner for a couple of weeks now. I bought it last night and when I showered this morning I tried it. Omg let me tell you. First off I love the scent. Its not strong and annoying but its perfect. And my hair never felt softer.  I told everyone about this stuff today. I deff recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I only used a bottle and a quarter. At first I liked it and had no issues, then I began to notice more hair in and around my sink, on my pillow, on my desk, in the shower and after a couple of weeks my hair line thinned, and my hair felt super limp. I stopped this shampoo immediately and it was been two weeks and hair is still falling but I&#x27;m waiting for it to stop. Please read the reviews before you decide to buy this shampoo,over 20 reviews about hair loss on various websites is not a joke.</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews often but I had to this time.  I like to try new things and so I wanted to give this a whirl.  My scalp was so itchy and started breaking out! Something that never has happened to me before.  My hair started falling out and I chalked it up to hormones because I had a baby four months ago.  I decided to switch out my shampoo to a new one after this bottle was gone and literally after the first use of the new shampoo my head stopped itching and i am already feeling so much better.  My hair has also stopped falling out! I have only used my new shampoo for two days.  I cannot believe how horrible clear scalp and hair therapy shampoo was!!!  PLEASE  don&#x27;t use this crap!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry, flaky, itchy dandruff for years! Nothing and I mean NOTHING made it go away. It was so bad that I would have to dust after everywhere I sat! I got this for free through shespeaks and gave it a try. I am so thankful for this shampoo and conditioner. After 3 shampoos my head was the completely clear! That hasn&#x27;t happened in YEARS! I did try the one specifically for dandruff but those results weren&#x27;t as good as the regular formula.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp burn and itch like crazy, all the way to the back of my neck!! Stay far away from these products!</li>
            <li> Id give it 0 stats but it is not an option on the star chart!  This product works well in the beginning, and then after a short bit into the second bottle I started to notice thinning of my hair!  I stopped using it once I realized the thinning was due to this shampoo, which was confirmed by all the horrifying reviews I have read!  It is now to a point that I am almost afraid to wash my hair for rubbing my scalp makes my hair come out!!:( Whoever made this product should be ashamed of themselves!  It should be removed from shelves and production!!  Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thin hair...and I&#x27;ve been using Clear for almost a year now. About a month into using it, my husband literally asked what I was doing differently. It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc (hey, I have thin hair - I can&#x27;t afford to lose any!)...but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched. Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!! (I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li> I just sent all the bottles I had of this garabage back to the company. I kept getting these red itchy hives all over my head and neck then noticed clumps of hair falling out. Thought it was hormones, I did not realize it was everytime I was using this shampoo and conditioner. Finally after realizing it was the shampoo mostly ( I used them as a test) causing the problems I goggled it and saw all the other complaints same as mine. I can&#x27;t understand how this is still being sold? There is an obvious problem with the product not all hundreds of complaints are just super senstive to this stuff. I am currently waiting to hear back from the company to see what there \\&quot;tests\\&quot; come up with from my bottles but I think its just a bad product! I warn everyone I can about this junk, and hope some people see these reviews and save there hair!</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is shedding so much and then I see I&#x27;m  not alone.I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3 months and my hair has coming out by the handful. I wish I had seen these reviews before because my hair is so thin now</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this shampoo daily.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy or coated. You definitely need to use it with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the thickest shampoos I have ever seen. I can wash my hair and let it sit for several minutes without it running into my eyes. I have not experienced any of the problems others complain about, and it does a great job cleaning my hair. The labeling is misleading, as it proclaims that it will \\&quot;nourish the scalp\\&quot; and more. With an *. The * states that you need to use the conditioner as well. So what exactly are the benefits of the shampoo alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a shampoo, it works great. Anything else? Who knows.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this shampoo. It smelled great and made my hair silky and manageable. I found that after using it my scalp itched/burned like crazy and I had constant headaches. At first, I just thought dandruff was the reason behind my irritated scalp. After using this about a month, the texture of my hair had completely changed. I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, but lots of it. My hair began to feel so thin and I could see my scalp through my hair. At this point I still didn&#x27;t connect these issues with the shampoo, until I noticed a bald spot on the back of my head! My hair had began to fall out! And not just a few strands, but a TON! I thought something was really wrong with me. After looking online and at these reviews, I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s this product because I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction to any kind of product ever in my life! I stopped use immediately about a week ago and my hair has continued to fall out. This product is horrible!!! I can&#x27;t say that enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the pretty scent and the pretty light color of this shampoo.  Also, a little goes a long way which is certainly nice for the pocketbook.  I didn&#x27;t particularly think my hair shone much with this shampoo.  It bordered on giving my hair a dull color.  The ingredients are impressive for a conventional shampoo since a lot of healthy ones are included.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product for right now. Been stocking up on this product. Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I just bought both shampoo and conditioner today from CVS and have not used it yet.  My hair is thin already and can&#x27;t afford to lose anymore!  I have my receipt and this crap will be returned promptly in the morning!!</li>
            <li> I started noticing that I was losing a ton of hair. I mean a lot and it was after a few months of switching to this shampoo. It started feeling thinner, not curling nearly as much as it used to, gets oily a lot faster... and its falling out. Id say that is quite a large reason to stop buying it. And by the looks of the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to add my two cents to everyone else&#x27;s. Been using this for about six months, and have recently noticed that my hairline in front is receding! I&#x27;m a 27yo female, and I feel like my 60yo dad right now. I&#x27;m going to try some argan oil shampoo to try to quickly fix this problem, and will never use this shampoo/conditioner again. Gross.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that tends to get frizzy (with coarse gray hairs as well). I was given good size samples of this shampoo and conditioner at my local supermarket the other day and tried them the next day. I noticed immediately that my hair was soft, even after just shampooing before conditioning and I always condition. I conditioned after and my hair was even softer. It felt like the texture of my hair changed for the better. After the second use, my gray hair no longer seemed coarse but had the same texture as the rest of my hair - it feels almost as soft as my 3 year old&#x27;s hair! After 2 uses, it looks like I have fewer split ends. I have wanted to grow my hair out but it tends to become unmanageable as it gets longer. With this product, I think I&#x27;ll be able to grow my hair out. I have used Wen and find this is just as good, if not better. I see there are a lot of reviews where people have allergic reactions and their hair has broken/fallen out. I tend to get allergic reactions to products, but not this one so far.</li>
            <li> Great smelling producting, decent at cleansing.  However, over a week or so I noticed my hair looked a bit greasy towards the end of the day which I don&#x27;t usually have to deal with.  Overall, &#x27;meh.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I received this through the Vine Voices program and was really excited about the prospect of a shampoo that would possibly take care of my scalp too. I have super fine hair, an oily scalp at the top and a dry scalp at the base of my head...quite the combination! I was hoping the shampoo would help to take care of the dry and itchy part of my head. I don&#x27;t have dandruff and don&#x27;t use dandruff shampoo, though I would like something that nourishes that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a padded envelope and a plastic bag and had leaked all over the bag. Not a good first impression. I hope that&#x27;s not the method of shipment for paying customers. I&#x27;d say a good 1/4 of the bottle was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for almost a month now and I&#x27;m very disappointed. After washing and rinsing I feel like I still have a film on my hair. Again, I have really fine hair, so I definitely don&#x27;t need a product meant to wash, leave a greasy film behind. It weighed down my hair and took away any shine, leaving it looking dirty. I am just not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no difference on my scalp, so overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone concerned with lack of hair volume or who wants to have shiny, soft hair!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this shampoo  and it is just what I needed..  Some people reviewed that it makes their fall out.  It happened to me with other brands of shampoos, but certainly not with Clear.  It does a great job for me, and I double the effect by using it along with the Clear conditioner.  My daughter loves both too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely looks good from the packaging so I was hopeful that it would also be a good shampoo. Upon opening the bottle, I can tell that it smells great. It kind of reminds me of Pantene Pro V or Pert Plus. I got compliments from my husband after that it smelled good and it did smell good for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem like it really cleaned my hair. Afterwards, it was still a little slick and after just one day, it was filled with grease and needed another washing. I also started to notice that my hair was falling out more than usual so I stopped using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought it might be good from the smell but I can&#x27;t have a bald head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t currently have dandruff so I sort of ignore my scalp but it makes sense that a healthy scalp will support healthy hair. I like this in that it leaves my scalp feeling clean without that tingly feeling you get with some dandruff shampoos. And I also like that is lacks that medicine smell of some dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s not a dandruff shampoo but I was sort of expecting the unpleasant odor of a dandruff shampoo and was pleasantly surprised that the smell was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I like how it makes my hair feel. Very soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like I should write a review for this brand. I am so suprised at how awful these reviews are! I have been using Clear shampoo and conditioner for over a year. My hair in the past has never been long, in the past year it has grown at least 6 inches. (Ive cut it three times because of this and i never get haircuts). I switch between the long lengths and total care to keep my hair from becoming ammune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like with any shampoo and conditioner you have the risk of your scalp and hair reacting negatively. I personally have has no issue with this product.</li>
            <li> It is great! Perfectly smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I reviewed Clear conditioner recently, and was very impressed with it.  I found it made a real different in how my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair felt and was able to be managed, so I was eager to try Clear shampoo.  I must say---it&#x27;s a pretty basic shampoo.  It worked, it cleaned my hair, it rinsed fairly well, it didn&#x27;t have an offensive odor, and there isn&#x27;t a lot else to say.  My hair felt about like it does when I use most mid-range shampoos, but not the way it does when I splurge on expensive shampoo like Pantene.  I would buy this if it were the brand on sale at the drugstore, but would not seek it out, and in a crowded shampoo brand market (I think) I am not sure how it will get noticed.</li>
            <li> At first I loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner. It smelled great, my hair was manageable, it curled perfectly. Then my hair started falling out. A few strands extra here and there. But my family starting saying mom your hair is everywheres. Then the clumps started coming out. I have stopped using the S&amp;C the clumps are still coming and I am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower. Hopefully it will stop I really enjoy having hair.</li>
            <li> Just add me to the long list of people who have had hair loss thanks to this product, I had no idea it was my shampoo. I lost so much hair, my hair line is ruined, I hardly have a ponytail anymore. I&#x27;m so insecure about my hair now, I can only wear it certain ways without looking ill. This stuff is the devil. Even if I did attempt to sue, no amount of money will bring my hair back. I wish I would have done some research on the product before I started using. Devastating results for so many people I don&#x27;t understand why they still sell this crap.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time. I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair, it was breaking. I was worried that maybe I had a health issue or maybe it was the generic birth control that I switched to recently instead of name brand. I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening. I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo Hair Loss\\&quot; in the suggestions box.. Panic immediatly set in. I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong. I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it. My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore. I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was. They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair! I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo. As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something! I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this. I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before. This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product. Don&#x27;t let it fool you! Upon further investigation- they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals. Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;.. whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis! This shampoo and conditioner is scary. I think something is horribly wrong with this product. After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were. Please write your review here and on makeupalley.com if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience! Hopefully it will help others before they have to suffer from a stupid mistake of using this product. I wish I would have found out sooner!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo, and wanted it to be awesome, but within a couple of days, I began noticing my scalp was super tender, like it had little cuts or something, and I was losing tons of hair, like I have never seen, even when I was pregnant years ago, it was crazy. So my hairdresser told me it was cutting my scalp, and I stopped using it, and switched to Redkin. No hair loss at all now. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I can&#x27;t warn you strongly enough, if you value your hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me say I only actually used this once.  But based on other reviews, I&#x27;m glad I threw this away after the first time.  My hair is fine and fairly long.  I had seen commercials and decided to give this a try.  After I used this, it left my hair quite greasy looking even though I had spent a decent amount of time rinsing my hair after washing.  I could not believe that this was the same shampoo I had read was really great.  It went in the trash the next day.  I will never use another product from the Clear line.</li>
            <li> WARNING!!! This product contains ALMOND nut oil. They hide the ingredients under another label that is hard to find. Such a bad choice when one of the ingredients is one of the top seven most dangerous anaphylaxic chemicals known.</li>
            <li> I noticed a HUGE difference in my scalp and hair after first use.  I have been battling with eczema for over 25 years.  This product cleared it up just after a few uses.  I have been using the long lengths for almost two months and still have had wonderful results. No more itchy scalp with scaling. My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy anymore and with the onset of gray hair I have noticed the texture of my hair changing to a more coarser feel. Well, that too changed after using this product.  I have been extremely happy and have told everyone I know about it and the few that have tried it also substantial differences in there hair and all were good.  As far as the rest of the consumers that are having opposite effects, sounds as if it is an allergic reaction to an ingredient.  Not sure, but hope that the makers of this product continue to supply us, that have had great results, with further hair care lines.  I would really hate to see this product go.  Like I said earlier, this has been the ONLY product that I have used that ever completely cleared my scalp. (Hence the name)</li>
            <li> At first I too loved this shampoo. After only 2 weeks (washing 3 times a week) my hair started falling out in huge amounts. I quit using it and after a month there seems to be less fall out. My once thick native hair is now weak and thin. My daughter also had the same results.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my self and then my husband.  We have been using it for a couple of months and I normally have thick hair that sheds a little so I didnt think any thing of it and thought it was getting worse due to hormones and age until my husband started complaining and now I see we are not the only ones! it has caused us to loose our hair!  This product should be removed from the shelves!</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought in a million years that this stuff would really work well. I&#x27;ve been using shampoos and conditioners from everything from Lazartigue to Kiehls and always had a problem with a dry, itchy scalp and dandruff. After a month or so of using this shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t have a problem. I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person who reads the ingredients list of EVERYTHING. I did a little experiment. I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients list until after I started using this product. I loved the feeling it gave my hair - nourished, just like the package promises. My scalp and hair felt great. I noticed the smell was pleasant even though I was sure it was a chemical fragrance. The ingredients are a real let down. The product definitely gives great results but I object to the long list of chemicals in this product. Most products have them. So, unless you are making your own or buying pricey health food store purist products, you will find this product attractive and not at all objectionable.

            <li> I have extremely course, dry hair that has been damaged by years of bleaching, highlighting and hair dyeing.  I also dont believe in trimming my hair because I&#x27;ve always had this dream of growing my hair down to my butt.  It never happened because either I always got the damaged ends trimmed, or the hair broke. Then I found Clear. Clear has literally transformed my hair.  The ends are healthier and protected so that my hair can grow without breaking. Now, for the first time in my life the ends are just about reaching to the waistband of my pants :)  When my hair gets down to my butt, I will go to the salon and give it a good trim - so if they take hair off up to my waist I wont mind hee hee.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly cannot live without this stuff. It works WONDERS for my hair...whereas Pantene&#x27;s long hair formula (great lengths) cannot even compare. It&#x27;s because of Clear that my hair is so long - it smells fantastic too. Makes my hair so fresh and CLEAN. I simply love it and cannot say enough about it. PLEASE dont ever stop making this line!!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, this product made my hair fall out in clumps. It took a while (many months) to figure out that it was this shampoo/conditioner brand. It also gave me a very irritated scalp and sores. This product is deceiving; at first I loved it, but over many months, it ruined my hair and scalp. I think the positive reviews are from people who just starting using this.</li>
            <li> Has anyone had luck with regrowth after stopping use for a few months or does the loss appear to be permanent?  I just discovered what this shampoo/conditioner has been doing to me for the past year and I am beyond devastated!  I started using this product in April of 2014 and looking back, I didn&#x27;t really notice any issues for the first 2 or 3 months. I actually thought my hair felt great so when I gradually started losing a few strands here and there, it never crossed my mind it could be due to the shampoo... Boy was I wrong... I eventually noticed I was losing more hair than normal and really started to worry because I could finally see/feel how much I&#x27;d actually lost... I went to the doctor November 2014 and they ran a bunch of tests which all came back normal. By then, this shampoo was no longer &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to me so I never thought to mention it. They assumed it was most likely a normal change for my age (29) or just stress and that it should pass... Well it didn&#x27;t... In the last 6 months, large patches of my hair started getting really coarse/wiry. My hairline (especially around my temples) has thinned so much you can see my white scalp. When it&#x27;s clean, it looks and feels greasy but it&#x27;s dry at the same time. I don&#x27;t ever dye my hair but in addition to all this, I noticed many strands seem to be losing some of their natural pigment - not drastic color loss like graying, but the pigment in each individual strand has become uneven.  I&#x27;ve spent countless hours researching illnesses that may cause symptoms like these... Thankfully all my research finally lead me to reviews on this shampoo. I feel SO stupid that for the past year I&#x27;ve been going to the doctor worried that there was something seriously wrong with me... I am unbelievably upset with myself that all along it&#x27;s been this horrible product and more so, that I&#x27;ve been doing it to myself... I just know I have more common sense than this and am so frustrated for not looking into this sooner.  I&#x27;m sorry tohear this happened to so many of you as well. Your results after stopping use are greatly appreciated...</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo ever. I have been using this product for a while and I could not figure out why y hair was shedding so much. My hair has came out tremendously. I recently read he reviews of others who used this product, I was in tears. This product should not be on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every product on the market for haircare. I have also had my hair dyed, bleached, chemically straightened, etc and never experienced anything that burned as bad as this product. I do not have a sensitive scalp...I used this shampoo once and within 10 minutes of washing it out my entire scalp was on fire. Even my ears were burning and red. I washed me hair 2 more times with a different shampoo to relieve the pain which helped a bit. It took several hours to quit burning and during the time it was burning my scalp and skin around my ears was red and splotchy. This was a very scary experience! Would rate a zero if I could!</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I hate the bottle design. No one with fingernails can possibly hold this bottle with wet hands and squeeze the contents without difficulty. The shampoo isn&#x27;t quite as bad as the conditioner to get out, but it&#x27;s all awful. Even if I liked the product a lot, the bottle design will keep me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I first saw this shampoo at Walmart. I was a little reluctant to buy the full size bottle.So I bought the travel size bottles of the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner and so far I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is pale pink a has a thick creamy consistency. It lathers really well and it smells great. The smell is very reminiscent of the original herbal essences shampoo only a little softer. I have dry, curly, frizz prone hair and this shampoo helped to tame my frizz. My hair also looked and felt fuller and thicker after styling. The only draw back with this shampoo is I felt a slight tingling and cooling sensation on my scalp. Not bothersome enough to keep me from repurchasing. All in all a great shampoo. I will definitely be purchasing the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> Not sure why all the bad reviews, I know a handful of people who use this shampoo and have had no ill effects, including myself. A little about my hair, it&#x27;s probably been every color under the sun. Recently, after not dying my brunette locks for 3 years, I decided to get a balayage. So here I am, a lovely shade of golden blonde - buying expensive hair shampoo after hair shampoo only to decide on Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty on a whim, shortly after seeing it&#x27;s name in Allure magazine. I know immediately after the first wash if my hair is going to like a shampoo or not, given that I have slightly wavy hair that needs a good blow out or a flat iron run through to limit frizz, I was surprised as how much the shampoo tamed all of that without the need for hot tools. I have not seen any negatives from the shampoo, no hair fall outs, no bald spots (thanks Amazon review for scaring the s*** out of me, except for a decent amount of volume, shine, and length contribution. Though I can&#x27;t say much for the conditioner because I only use it on my ends (a fine hair tip - don&#x27;t condition your scalp!) my ends seem to look pretty full and healthy to me. I&#x27;m satisfied and to be quite honest, I rarely am.</li>
            <li> I NEVER take the time out to write reviews for any product I purchase, but this has really changed my hair. I am African American with relaxed hair, but I am transitioning to natural so I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer since September. I started using this shampoo in October. I had a severely itchy and flaky scalp. I couldn&#x27;t even wear black tops anymore! After just two washes I almost immediately noticed a difference in my itchy and flaky scalp. After the first wash, I noticed that my hair was more shiny and softer. Countless washes later, and I&#x27;m sooo thankful that I picked up the trial size of this shampoo and conditioner at Target. My hair looks so healthy and shiny that sometimes I can&#x27;t stop looking at it! My hair has noticably grown 3 inches over the past 2 months. I love it so much that I washed my sister&#x27;s hair with it (she has some of the same issues that I had) and she loves it as well! I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about how healthy my hair looks,and I love it! I only gave it 4 stars because I still have to use my Organic Root Stimulator Replenishing Pack. Otherwise, my hair seems a little dry after I blow dry it. I also can&#x27;t totally contribute the growth of my hair to the shampoo because I have also been taking 10,000 mcg of Biotin (purchased through Amazon)for the past 6 months. I haven&#x27;t experienced any more breakage than I have in the past, and I definitely have not experienced my hair falling out in clumps as some other reviewers stated. I hope this stays around for years to come!</li>
            <li> In early November, I started using Clear. Within weeks, I noticed hair loss. I didn&#x27;t think much of it and attributed it to stress from a new job. By mid December I was losing clumps of hair in the shower and while styling. Recently, I have been losing so much hair that I have to clear the drain twice while I shower. It got to the point that I would worry that something was horribly wrong with me. I noticed my hair was much thinner and starting to look sparse in some areas and a couple of days ago, (jan18), I looked closely at my hair line and realized I was almost bald in the front!!!! I started crying thinking how awful it looked and how something really is wrong and I even wondered if I could be dying. I know that sounds dramatic but when you have hair so thick that it takes over an hour to blow dry and look in the mirror and see you are practically bald, you would react the same way! I started thinking about what I have been exposed to and what I have changed and all I could come up with was this shampoo. I did a little research on google and I am 100% certain Clear products are to blame.  I started this Facebook : [...]  I realize that not everyone has had this reaction but enough have and something needs to be done and people need to be warned.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis. I&#x27;ve used Pantene and head &amp; shoulders. Tried this once. Within hours I had blisters on my hands and a scalp weeping clear fluid. My psoriasis came back in full force and I&#x27;ve lost nearly all my hair. Was told by the company it must&#x27;ve been a reaction to the perfume. More like the POISONS. DON&#x27;T USE IT!!</li>
            <li> Started this shampoo about two weeks ago. I usually have really bad frizzy hair and this shampoo seems to tame it.  My hair feels very soft and healthy.  Don&#x27;t understand why there is a lot of bad reviews but so far it&#x27;s worked for me! !</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law recommended this product to me.  At first I loved it! My hair smelled so good! Then, I realized that my hair was thinning and falling out in clumps after two weeks.  I thought it was not related to the shampoo, until she told me today that HER hair is falling out! Do not buy this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so healthy and strong. I will use this product again when the bottle is empty. Love it.</li>
            <li> i am in utter  shock with all the bad reviews on here. i recently purchased a big jug of both  clear  shampoo and the conditioner at BJ&#x27;s. i am on my second wash and i absolutely  love  this product so far!. i know it hasn&#x27;t been long enough,so  i will review again in a couple of weeks. IT BETTER WORK! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; keep in mind, i have lots of hair, very curly and frizzy.  i suffer from very itchy dry scalp and dandruff (mostly in the front and middle of my scalp). its horribleeeee!!!.  i was fed up with  my unhealthy scalp  that i was  determined  to find a solution to the problem ( i think i did). i love this product so far. I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoos in the past  and  almost immediately  after washing i can see my scalp literally  drying up and becoming flaking within minutes. NOT WITH CLEAR! CLEAR shampoo and conditioner  really does focus on giving  your scalp the therapy  it needs.  the smell is delicious and my hair hasn&#x27;t been falling out ( just the usual). I&#x27;m not going to lie.....i am absolutely scared  because of  all the negative reviews but i won&#x27;t  stop using it because so far  I LOVE IT.  i recommend  for  people or are  skeptical  to  give it a try ... everyone is different and it just may be  what you&#x27;ve been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and just one more thing. I&#x27;ve stopped  washing my hair with  hot water (still enjoy my hot showers) but i wash my hair with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;based on my  readings hot water for your scalp is a no no.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is really creepy.  The first day I used it, I felt like my head was in a fog.  I figured it was just the summer heat, but after four days, I figured out the connection and stopped using it.  I immediately felt better.  This product also made the skin around my scalp, neck, and shoulders feel really difference than normal.  It maeks me wonder what the heck is in there.  I recommend avoiding it.</li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT. Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else. Went to the doctor and had all blood work done. Everything FINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene. Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out. Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained. They said this was unusual... I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck. If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.</li>
            <li> I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I&#x27;ve tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don&#x27;t work for them. I&#x27;m just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.  I have a very oily, itchy scalp.  I often scratch my scalp and get oily residue underneath my nails but this fixes that problem with daily use.  I can&#x27;t use the conditioner unfortunately, because my hair is just too oily for it.  I highly recommend this product.  My only hesitation with giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that my hair is just SO oily that sometimes I have to use baby powder mid day to get rid of some oil.  For normal hair people it should be wonderful, but for me it is worth it because it gets rid of the dandruff!</li>
            <li> Product makes hair smell wonderful but it made my hair fall out ALOT. just like alot of other ladies on here..also made my scalp itchy and dry, never had dandruff until i tried this line of shampoo..clear needs to be taken off the shelves</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner. There&#x27;s nothing really \\&quot;wow\\&quot; about the product compared to all the other types I&#x27;ve tried and used. The design of the conditioner bottle was a pain in the but to try and squeeze out what&#x27;s left if it; especially when you&#x27;re in the shower and your hands are wet.</li>
