            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Nice product in my hair.</li>
            <li>just being another tried it won&#x27;t buy it again kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Great product worth the money!</li>
            <li>Still had a nice bit of volume &amp; bounce &amp; looked healthy &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I was able to wash then</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Then my mother said it was OK</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and thought this was &amp;</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the product, it works wonders for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter used this and it made her hair look great -- shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The title just says &amp;#34;for fine hair&amp;#34; and it was in the list of items that were on sale for mothers day</li>
            <li>It makes it sliky and smooth but no added volume.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smell amazing and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and made hair soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is all right.  </li>
            <li>The price wasn&#x27;t worth returning but it made me very upset when I was apologizing to my mother</li>
            <li>I usually only condition every third day &amp; accept my hair will be super soft &amp; fly away that day</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT along with the Fine to Full Blow out spray is does make my hair look and feel thicker without giving it a stiff hard feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for some time now, and I really like the product, my hair is much fuller after using this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Will have to use longer to see how well it really does work.</li>
            <li>This product gives me more volume than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Like SO many other &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; boosting shampoos this one ended up</li>
            <li>My other volumizing line does a much more noticeable job.</li>
            <li>I like the sheer blonde line better.</li>
            <li>I ran it through my hair as I normally would; didn&#x27;t leave it on for an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so one star because the price isn&#x27;t worth sending back.   </li>
            <li>If anything it seemed to weigh my hair down and left it feeling kind of unclean.</li>
            <li>I think actually this shampoo does make my look of hair with more volumn, but it also makes my hair too dry and cause dandruff.</li>
            <li>She has a ton of hair and this was able to tame that beast.</li>
            <li>I did notice a little more volume at my roots but nothing major.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels soft and a lot thicker than before I used it!  </li>
            <li>Feels a bit heavy when wet, even after a rinse, but works beautifully once hair is dry.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>felt silky soft without being lank or flyaway.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly normal texture for a conditioner (unlike with the shampoo from the same product line, which is sort of gelatinous).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the color protection claims (kind of hard to judge, in general).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but worth the price.</li>
            <li>hair is fairly soft and smooth today (even the ends, at least a little bit).  </li>

            <li> Not sure if this is to blame or not.  </li>

            <li> I think actually this shampoo does make my look of hair with more volumn, but it also makes my hair too dry and cause dandruff. Maybe it just not fit people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have very thin, fine, long hair. This product gives me more volume than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my hair shiny and bouncy. It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a set with the shampoo &amp; blow out spray when it was discounted in Rite Aid. I am really pleased with the product, it works wonders for my baby fine hair. I usually only condition every third day &amp; accept my hair will be super soft &amp; fly away that day or I reverse wash by conditioning before shampoo. I was able to wash then condition my hair with the John Frieda shampoo then conditioner &amp; my hair felt silky soft without being lank or flyaway. Still had a nice bit of volume &amp; bounce &amp; looked healthy &amp; shiny. Personally still think I would only use every second day or so for my hair but at least I know I don&#x27;t have to accept a bad hair day as the price of keeping my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the sheer blonde line better. hair kinda falls flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for some time now, and I really like the product, my hair is much fuller after using this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Excellent  for my hair . I never more wanna stop,using it</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does a good job at adding volume to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is all right.  It has a fairly normal texture for a conditioner (unlike with the shampoo from the same product line, which is sort of gelatinous).  I ran it through my hair as I normally would; didn&#x27;t leave it on for an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly soft and smooth today (even the ends, at least a little bit).  So I think this helped with that.  I did also use a detangling spray last night when my hair was wet, and a bit of hair oil this morning.  Unlike other conditioners, this conditioner did NOT assist my detangling spray -- it was actually a bit difficult to comb through my hair last night.  Not sure if this is to blame or not.  But my frizz is definitely reduced, even though we&#x27;ve been having lots of nasty winter weather lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, since I didn&#x27;t see them in the product listing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, cetearyl alcohol, behenamidopropyl dimethylamine, fragrance, lactic acid, isopropyl palmitate, silicone quaternium-22, propylene glycol, c24-28 alkyl dimethicone, diazolidinyl urea, ppg-3 myristyl ether, glycine, stearalkonium chloride, glycerin, sea salt, malic acid, alcohol denat., amp-isostearoyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the color protection claims (kind of hard to judge, in general).  However, I do feel that I got a slight boost in volume between this and the conditioner, without doing anything out of the ordinary to my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes a noticeable difference in volume.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do - give you the appearance of fuller hair!</li>
            <li> The description does not say that this is for color treated hair. The title just says &amp;#34;for fine hair&amp;#34; and it was in the list of items that were on sale for mothers day but my mother doesn&#x27;t have color treated hair so one star because the price isn&#x27;t worth sending back.   Update;  Someone put 2 shampoos in the box and it was a mother&#x27;s day gift. The price wasn&#x27;t worth returning but it made me very upset when I was apologizing to my mother because what was pictured/described wasn&#x27;t for color treated hair but that was what arrived. Then my mother said it was OK and it was the thought that counted but &amp;#34;did you intend to buy 2 shampoos? &amp;#34; I looked at it and was embarrassed because I didn&#x27;t notice it, and what was she suppose to do? Not condition her hair? Totally unacceptable</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fully and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the staying power of my color since using this product. It leaves hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times. I did notice a little more volume at my roots but nothing major. It smelled nice and made hair soft. Will have to use longer to see how well it really does work.Good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but worth the price. Makes my hair smell amazing and extremely soft. I wish they sold this in larger amounts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to do what it claimed.  Like SO many other &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; boosting shampoos this one ended up just being another tried it won&#x27;t buy it again kind of thing.  If anything it seemed to weigh my hair down and left it feeling kind of unclean.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT along with the Fine to Full Blow out spray is does make my hair look and feel thicker without giving it a stiff hard feeling.  My hair looks and feels soft and a lot thicker than before I used it!  Great product worth the money!</li>
            <li> smells good and does seem to pump hair up a bit</li>
