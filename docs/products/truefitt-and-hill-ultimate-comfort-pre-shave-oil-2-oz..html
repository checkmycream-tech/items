            <li>The Skin Food is great to use before and after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My shave is close and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>While the scent is nice (smells like a very bright lemoncello)</li>
            <li>Excellent and love the plastic bottle</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also just generally good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots of good oils out there that serve the purpose and have an impact on the quality of your shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and a great start to each shave.</li>
            <li>Good stuff but</li>
            <li>I originally tried the Truefitt &amp; Hill pre-shave oil in their sample pack and was impressed with the lubricity (is that a word?)</li>
            <li>Greatly promotes my Baby Smooth Shave (BBS)!  </li>
            <li>And what follows is the smoothest, most effortless shave!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>After a nice hot shower (which is the best time to shave), I take 3-5 drops and rub it over the beard for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The Art of Shaving pre-shave oil also has a thicker consistency and you get their amazing scents to boot.     </li>
            <li>I love the bright lemon/citrus scent of this oil.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Great, clean shave when used under their soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>Its light and fresh and smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you want a great shave, if you want that \\&quot;I just got a facial in my own bathroom and am prepared to face the world\\&quot; feeling that you get from a great shave, then you&#x27;ve got to use a pre-shave oil.  </li>
            <li>Assist me in getting the best shaves by far.  </li>
            <li>Scent is citrusy, mild, and pleasant.</li>
            <li>that might be true but I really loved this one.     </li>
            <li>The scent is a very light citrus.  </li>
            <li>I love Truefitt and Hill</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t list brands but the inexpensive oils have more substance (thicker) and protection than this.  </li>
            <li>To read the reviews, you would think this was some magical potion.  </li>
            <li>This oil smells much better than The Art products in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>it helps me have a better shave and saves my skin from irritation.     </li>
            <li>Life is too short to use anything but the Best!</li>
            <li>It has an interesting feeling</li>
            <li>and I was able to shave without getting nicks, redness or burns</li>
            <li>It is light, aromatic, and sets up the beard nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I get a better shave with this than I do at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s significantly better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The lower costs oils got the job done, but the pricier oils seem to be better for one reason or another.  </li>
            <li>I.e. thicker, smell better, or (Art of Shaving)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job, they all seem to be better than going</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to that.</li>
            <li>so many more to try and sample,&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Most guys shave after they shower.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>love it and am a convert.</li>
            <li>I get a great glide from my DE razor too, but the smell and added freshness is the main reason i use this oil.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good pre-shave oil.  </li>
            <li>I have used Trumpers shave cream (which is great), for awhile and thought it would be nice to get another British shaving aid, so bought the T&amp;L pre shave.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this will help eliminate nicks &amp; razor burn and (because it smells and feels so great)</li>
            <li>Stuff was oily and, more importantly, I did not experience a discernable difference between using it or not.  </li>
            <li>pre-shave oil--- a great smelling product that really sets your beard up for a super shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fresh lemon scent that seems to really improve the razor glide.  </li>
            <li>the orange scent can be a bit strong</li>
            <li>Truefitt makes some great shaving creams and I generally believe in what they do, but this is a phoned in product.      </li>
            <li>I will always keep a bottle of this because sometimes I feel like a change up and this dose about as good a job as my normal pre-shave oil.  </li>
            <li>#38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have a few in the rotation that work well, but this without question the lightest, best smelling of the bunch</li>
            <li>Not because it&#x27;s cheap, but because it works.</li>
            <li>Smells good and not messy.</li>
            <li>Well, I was hesitant to pay this much for a pre shave oil but decided to try it and wish I hadn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li>:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>All you need are 3-5 drops worth!  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product which really works and really helps with smoother shave and no (less) cuts.  </li>
            <li>I got this oil primarily since I wanted a citrus smelling oil (wich I find very uplifting and refreshing in the morning)</li>
            <li>$8 for 3-times a much and arguably a better oil.</li>
            <li>The presentation and the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li>This oil works good and preparing the face prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and will definitely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Light not heavy and oily like most of the pre-shave oils.</li>
            <li>Two years ago I didn&#x27;t know about shaving oils and still don&#x27;t understand why shaving cream by itself isn&#x27;t completely adequate.  </li>
            <li>the scent is citric (like tangerine, orange etc) which I enjoy very much.   </li>
            <li>This pre-shave oil has a great, slight lemon smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Fresh lemon scent, not oily, and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>First used in the original Barber Shop in London.</li>
            <li>In fact, sometimes I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, because this oil does such a nice job.    </li>
            <li>Definitely adds to a nice shaving experience</li>
            <li>and I might have expected more, but I find the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil to work better.</li>
            <li>But the Shave Secret was the best among all of them.</li>
            <li>First apply a steam towel or very hot water to face and then add the pre-shave oil before your shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Just the right viscosity for my preference.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is way overpriced and really doesn&#x27;t add anything special to my shave.  </li>
            <li>The oils aren&#x27;t very rich, and the reviewer who said that it smelled less like citrus and more like lemon juice is right.  </li>
            <li>I dislike it very much.</li>
            <li>My wife described it as \\&quot;lemon cake\\&quot;, which I think is pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried The Gentleman&#x27;s Refinery pre-shave oil (TGR makes an outstanding but pricey shaving cream), but it pales in comparison to Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Ultimate Comfort</li>
            <li>I have a very thick beard and get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at around 2 o&#x27;clock!  </li>
            <li>The Art of Shaving has a nice thick, rich oil at this price.</li>
            <li>Slowing down a little bit, enjoying the process of a luxurious lather produced from a fine shaving cream and badger brush - just creates a better start to the day.  </li>
            <li>If I am shaving right after a hot shower, I don&#x27;t use the pre-shave oil as my beard is already fairly soft and ready for shaving.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in shaving when using a straight razor or a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>It is way too much like water.  </li>
            <li>It smells like RealLemon and isn&#x27;t much thicker than water.  </li>
            <li>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t take much...</li>
            <li>Really works in keeping the face moisturized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference in thickness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Also very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Smells very lemony which I personnaly like and works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I like this, I&#x27;m really hooked on Trumper&#x27;s West Indian Limes Skin Food.  </li>
            <li>At 30 bones for two ounces, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t add any real additional moisture or slickness to the shave area.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li>Art of Shaving was too thick, didn&#x27;t smell as good, but cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other preshave oil I habe used.</li>
            <li>this pre shave is decent.</li>
            <li>More expensive than most, but a blend of edible oils that I&#x27;d put on my skin versus inedible oils that I won&#x27;t put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s received high ratings</li>
            <li>like I normally would.</li>
            <li>Really good pre shave oil, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>This seems negative, but in fact it allows you to gently press to better control the number of drops of oil you use each time.  </li>
            <li>For far less money, one could simply use baby oil and it would be thicker and would do the job much better.</li>
            <li>good lord, this stuff is lame.   </li>
            <li>but it is not as thick or as protective as the oil from \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; which does a better job.    </li>
            <li>But if you really want a better shave use SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong!    </li>
            <li>Just a few drops after shower and I&#x27;m shaved and clean in a few minutes without having to whip up the foam and clean up afterword.</li>
            <li>Cost a little more than some other pre-shave oil&#x27;s that I like a little more but not really enough to make any difference.  </li>
            <li>The main point I MUST stress is that you should only use 3-4 drops max.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that product (or standard baby oil) if you truly want to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>Your razor really does glide over your face no matter how long you&#x27;ve gone between shaves.</li>
            <li>I used the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; oil when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li>so it will last a little longer than one that spills out in a free flow onto your hand.  </li>
            <li>Only negative is it would be better if it came in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented and used two to three times more and got poor results.  </li>
            <li>true \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is a Sample Mini bar bottle kind of, truly way too expensive not only for its lilliput size but for being of any beneficial pre-shave effects at all.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had razor burn on my sensitive skin like I used to get frequently in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If not shaving during/after a shower, I&#x27;ll do a hot cloth over my face/neck a couple times before rubbing some of this in and wait a few minutes, then applying the shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li>I think the Skin Food is less greasy and does not clog pores as much.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells good and not messy.</li>
            <li> Well, I was hesitant to pay this much for a pre shave oil but decided to try it and wish I hadn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> :B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> All you need are 3-5 drops worth!  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product which really works and really helps with smoother shave and no (less) cuts.  </li>
            <li> I got this oil primarily since I wanted a citrus smelling oil (wich I find very uplifting and refreshing in the morning)</li>
            <li> $8 for 3-times a much and arguably a better oil.</li>
            <li> The presentation and the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li> This oil works good and preparing the face prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and will definitely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Light not heavy and oily like most of the pre-shave oils.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I didn&#x27;t know about shaving oils and still don&#x27;t understand why shaving cream by itself isn&#x27;t completely adequate.  </li>
            <li> the scent is citric (like tangerine, orange etc) which I enjoy very much.   </li>
            <li> This pre-shave oil has a great, slight lemon smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Fresh lemon scent, not oily, and works quickly.  </li>
            <li> First used in the original Barber Shop in London.</li>
            <li> In fact, sometimes I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, because this oil does such a nice job.    </li>
            <li> Definitely adds to a nice shaving experience</li>
            <li> and I might have expected more, but I find the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil to work better.</li>
            <li> But the Shave Secret was the best among all of them.</li>
            <li> First apply a steam towel or very hot water to face and then add the pre-shave oil before your shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Just the right viscosity for my preference.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is way overpriced and really doesn&#x27;t add anything special to my shave.  </li>
            <li> The oils aren&#x27;t very rich, and the reviewer who said that it smelled less like citrus and more like lemon juice is right.  </li>
            <li> I dislike it very much.</li>
            <li> My wife described it as \\&quot;lemon cake\\&quot;, which I think is pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried The Gentleman&#x27;s Refinery pre-shave oil (TGR makes an outstanding but pricey shaving cream), but it pales in comparison to Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Ultimate Comfort</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at around 2 o&#x27;clock!  </li>
            <li> The Art of Shaving has a nice thick, rich oil at this price.</li>
            <li> Slowing down a little bit, enjoying the process of a luxurious lather produced from a fine shaving cream and badger brush - just creates a better start to the day.  </li>
            <li> If I am shaving right after a hot shower, I don&#x27;t use the pre-shave oil as my beard is already fairly soft and ready for shaving.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in shaving when using a straight razor or a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> It is way too much like water.  </li>
            <li> It smells like RealLemon and isn&#x27;t much thicker than water.  </li>
            <li> Of course, it doesn&#x27;t take much...</li>
            <li> Really works in keeping the face moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference in thickness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> Also very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> Smells very lemony which I personnaly like and works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I like this, I&#x27;m really hooked on Trumper&#x27;s West Indian Limes Skin Food.  </li>
            <li> At 30 bones for two ounces, I expected more.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t add any real additional moisture or slickness to the shave area.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li> Art of Shaving was too thick, didn&#x27;t smell as good, but cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other preshave oil I habe used.</li>
            <li> this pre shave is decent.</li>
            <li> More expensive than most, but a blend of edible oils that I&#x27;d put on my skin versus inedible oils that I won&#x27;t put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s received high ratings</li>
            <li> like I normally would.</li>
            <li> Really good pre shave oil, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This seems negative, but in fact it allows you to gently press to better control the number of drops of oil you use each time.  </li>
            <li> For far less money, one could simply use baby oil and it would be thicker and would do the job much better.</li>
            <li> good lord, this stuff is lame.   </li>
            <li> but it is not as thick or as protective as the oil from \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; which does a better job.    </li>
            <li> But if you really want a better shave use SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong!    </li>
            <li> Just a few drops after shower and I&#x27;m shaved and clean in a few minutes without having to whip up the foam and clean up afterword.</li>
            <li> Cost a little more than some other pre-shave oil&#x27;s that I like a little more but not really enough to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> The main point I MUST stress is that you should only use 3-4 drops max.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that product (or standard baby oil) if you truly want to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Your razor really does glide over your face no matter how long you&#x27;ve gone between shaves.</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; oil when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li> so it will last a little longer than one that spills out in a free flow onto your hand.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is it would be better if it came in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented and used two to three times more and got poor results.  </li>
            <li> true \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is a Sample Mini bar bottle kind of, truly way too expensive not only for its lilliput size but for being of any beneficial pre-shave effects at all.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had razor burn on my sensitive skin like I used to get frequently in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If not shaving during/after a shower, I&#x27;ll do a hot cloth over my face/neck a couple times before rubbing some of this in and wait a few minutes, then applying the shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li> I think the Skin Food is less greasy and does not clog pores as much.  </li>
            <li> I bought this pre shave oil when I first started DE shaving but only used it a few times until I learned another trick on a wet shaving forum that I am on.  </li>
            <li> Not really outstanding and not really poor either, just middle of the road.</li>
            <li> After getting back into wet shaving with a double edged razor, I find the total shaving experience has improved.  </li>
            <li> It does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product gets such high marks.</li>
            <li> As it says on the bottle - if you have little prep time or sensitive skin, this pre-shave oil is for you!  </li>
            <li> Lasts .a long time...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work into the beard well, and it doesn&#x27;t have the same sort of luxurious effect to it that other oils have.     </li>
            <li> No nicks, cuts or dry, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not alcohol based, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this oil, but there is also nothing special about it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much (a few drops) to provide an extra layer of slickness for a traditional wet shave.  </li>
            <li> but this little 2 oz bottle will last a really long time if used correctly.</li>
            <li> However, the price was the only thing that put me off, especially since it was a gift, and I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle is for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it only makes a slight improvement in the shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little extra slickness to keep that blade gliding!</li>
            <li> One of the things I&#x27;ve learned about wet shaving is....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other oil.  </li>
            <li> It comes out a lot slower than other pre-shave oils</li>
            <li> I have read reviews on other sites where they just say use Olive oil.  </li>
            <li> It outperforms 3 other brands which I have used.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to and am not basing my stars rating on because I feel this was my fault in not paying attention (other reviews do mention citrus)</li>
            <li> I plan to keep on trying other pre shave products.</li>
            <li> For the past six weeks, this is the only pre-shave treatment I&#x27;ve used, not even using shave cream.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way with this stuff too.  </li>
            <li> a few drops is sufficient, so the small bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was cheaper, so down a star for price.  </li>
            <li> It feels like so much less than I wanted it to be.  </li>
            <li> I have also used The Art of Shaving oil, as a previous reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It travels like a champ, with much less to carry, and it&#x27;s under the TSA liquid</li>
            <li> Well, with this stuff, after you apply it to your face you have to scub it off your hands which have turned into a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> For less irritation and a smoother shave, just work a few drops into your face after showering and before shaving.</li>
            <li> However, for those days when I have already showered previously and don&#x27;t need to shower again, or if I&#x27;m in a hurry and just need to shave, I apply a few drops of this pre-shave oil and wait 1-2 mins for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few drops per shave is all you need.</li>
            <li> and it is not as heavy &amp; oily feeling as some of the others.</li>
            <li> I place a few drops on my whatever shave soap</li>
            <li> But when I used a few drops, it did the job and didn&#x27;t clog the razor</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easier as I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> But I have used quite a few expensive shave oil including After Shave, Truefit and various other name brands.</li>
            <li> you will actually look forward to/enjoy shaving in the morning- seriously!</li>
            <li> I love TH shaving cremes but this and their shampoo line are terrible.</li>
            <li> figure.&lt;br /&gt;4) Cost - yes, it is expensive, but acceptable to me given that I only use 4-5 drops per shave.</li>
            <li> Since doing this I have not had hardly any issues with weepers or cuts while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say definitively,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and provides very little added protection beyond your shaving cream.</li>
            <li> If you want a serious grooming routine, use an oil.      </li>
            <li> I know some say this is either too thin or too thick, depending on their preference.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thin and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> The bottle feels a tad thin, and is plastic.  </li>
            <li> the oil is neither so thick that it feels greasy, nor so thin that it feels useless</li>
            <li> I recommend the product for this purpose, but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a gimmick, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but the bottle lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I know it is fairly expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Four stars because it is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but eliminates Razor Burn and is the basis for the smoothest shaves.</li>
            <li> Draw-back; it&#x27;s darned expensive</li>
            <li> The oil is very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that the product makes no decernable difference in the shave itself.</li>

            <li> Works great for hubby- shaves smmmooooth.</li>
            <li> Good but the lemon can get a bit overpowering.  The art of shaving oil seems thicker.  It&#x27;s buy this again based on pricing.</li>
            <li> I love Truefitt and Hill but this is way too watery.</li>
            <li> Yikes!  I like their shaving cream but good lord, this stuff is lame.   I won&#x27;t list brands but the inexpensive oils have more substance (thicker) and protection than this.  In fact, any of the cheaper ones blow this away.  It is way too much like water.  Crappy purchase, would not buy this again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving with and without this pre-shave oil a few times, and can confirm that it really does make a difference. For less irritation and a smoother shave, just work a few drops into your face after showering and before shaving. I would estimate that 2 oz can last &gt; 6 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list of Amazon-acquired shaving supplies:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004COMB5W Osma Styptic Pencil, Hemo Stop]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> If you want a great shave, if you want that \\&quot;I just got a facial in my own bathroom and am prepared to face the world\\&quot; feeling that you get from a great shave, then you&#x27;ve got to use a pre-shave oil.  You get a closer shave, which if you&#x27;re shaving with a safety razor as opposed to a cartridge, that matters.  It&#x27;s also just generally good for the skin.  If you want a serious grooming routine, use an oil.      Don&#x27;t use this one.      It feels like so much less than I wanted it to be.  Truefitt makes some great shaving creams and I generally believe in what they do, but this is a phoned in product.      The oils aren&#x27;t very rich, and the reviewer who said that it smelled less like citrus and more like lemon juice is right.  It smells like RealLemon and isn&#x27;t much thicker than water.  It doesn&#x27;t work into the beard well, and it doesn&#x27;t have the same sort of luxurious effect to it that other oils have.     Aiden Gill makes a product that&#x27;s cheaper and richer.  The Art of Shaving pre-shave oil also has a thicker consistency and you get their amazing scents to boot.     There&#x27;s lots of good oils out there that serve the purpose and have an impact on the quality of your shave.  This one doesn&#x27;t, and at this price, it&#x27;s unacceptable.     -mc</li>
            <li> This is the best priced for the money but it is not as thick or as protective as the oil from \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; which does a better job.    I love TH shaving cremes but this and their shampoo line are terrible.</li>
            <li> After getting back into wet shaving with a double edged razor, I find the total shaving experience has improved.  Slowing down a little bit, enjoying the process of a luxurious lather produced from a fine shaving cream and badger brush - just creates a better start to the day.  This product is not strictly necessary if you take the proper care in moisturizing your face prior to application of the lather.  However, if in a rush, the shaving oil helps the prep process quite a bit.  I recommend the product for this purpose, but it is expensive.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t take much... a few drops is sufficient, so the small bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this oil, but there is also nothing special about it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it based on others reviews of this shave oil.  To read the reviews, you would think this was some magical potion.  It&#x27;s just like any other oil.  In fact, I prefer the AoS pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To its defense, it does have a great lemony smell.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good pre-shave oil.  Cost a little more than some other pre-shave oil&#x27;s that I like a little more but not really enough to make any difference.  It comes out a lot slower than other pre-shave oils so it will last a little longer than one that spills out in a free flow onto your hand.  I will always keep a bottle of this because sometimes I feel like a change up and this dose about as good a job as my normal pre-shave oil.  You should also check out \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> I originally tried the Truefitt &amp; Hill pre-shave oil in their sample pack and was impressed with the lubricity (is that a word?) it provided for my shave.  The scent is a very light citrus.  My wife described it as \\&quot;lemon cake\\&quot;, which I think is pretty close.  It doesn&#x27;t take much (a few drops) to provide an extra layer of slickness for a traditional wet shave.  However, the price was the only thing that put me off, especially since it was a gift, and I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle is for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Really works in keeping the face moisturized. First apply a steam towel or very hot water to face and then add the pre-shave oil before your shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other preshave oil I habe used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have also used The Art of Shaving oil, as a previous reviewer mentioned.  I don&#x27;t notice much difference in thickness.  This oil smells much better than The Art products in my opinion.  I love this scent and will definitely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never shaved with a pre-shave oil, you have to give it a try.  I thought it was a gimmick, but I was wrong.  And I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong!    All you need are 3-5 drops worth!  I have a very thick beard and get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at around 2 o&#x27;clock!  After a nice hot shower (which is the best time to shave), I take 3-5 drops and rub it over the beard for about 30 seconds.  It&#x27;s actually very relaxing.  I then apply the shaving cream - I prefer Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams - with a brush.  Also very relaxing.  And what follows is the smoothest, most effortless shave!  No nicks, cuts or dry, irritated skin.  In fact, sometimes I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, because this oil does such a nice job.    With 5 times a week use, this bottle lasted me about 4 months.  Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but the bottle lasts and lasts. Nice smell and a great start to each shave.</li>
            <li> some people say pre shave oil isnt necessary. that might be true but I really loved this one.     the scent is citric (like tangerine, orange etc) which I enjoy very much.   it helps me have a better shave and saves my skin from irritation.     price is hi but what they say is true \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After a couple attempts at finding a good oil this one is perfect. I&#x27;ve posted a pic of my combo. If you haven&#x27;t tried these items you should. All from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been shaving DE and soap for 10 years now and this is my best combo.&lt;br /&gt;Razo Roc don Marco soap&lt;br /&gt;Geo F coral skin food&lt;br /&gt;This oil&lt;br /&gt;SEki Feather Razor&lt;br /&gt;Badger brush</li>
            <li> I got this oil primarily since I wanted a citrus smelling oil (wich I find very uplifting and refreshing in the morning) and this oil does not dissapoint. Its light and fresh and smells absolutely wonderful. The bottle lasts forever, I ive had mine for over a year now and still plenty left. A few drops per shave is all you need. I get a great glide from my DE razor too, but the smell and added freshness is the main reason i use this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried The Gentleman&#x27;s Refinery pre-shave oil (TGR makes an outstanding but pricey shaving cream), but it pales in comparison to Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Ultimate Comfort pre-shave oil--- a great smelling product that really sets your beard up for a super shave.  If you have sensitive skin, this will help eliminate nicks &amp; razor burn and (because it smells and feels so great) you will actually look forward to/enjoy shaving in the morning- seriously!</li>
            <li> Just as described by seller, and it was a great surprise for my brother!</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; oil when I first started wet shaving. This stuff is delightful! Life is too short to use anything but the Best!</li>
            <li> I bought this pre shave oil when I first started DE shaving but only used it a few times until I learned another trick on a wet shaving forum that I am on.  The trick is basically to wash your face in the shower and then put this stuff on after you rinse to help &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the moisture into your beard.  Since doing this I have not had hardly any issues with weepers or cuts while shaving.  A little bit goes a very long way with this stuff too.  I know it is fairly expensive for what you get but this little 2 oz bottle will last a really long time if used correctly.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and just order some inexpensive jojoba oil (at Trader Joes and elsewhere online). $8 for 3-times a much and arguably a better oil.</li>
            <li> Well, I was hesitant to pay this much for a pre shave oil but decided to try it and wish I hadn&#x27;t!!!.... only because now I do not want to use anything else.... I have a few in the rotation that work well, but this without question the lightest, best smelling of the bunch and it is not as heavy &amp; oily feeling as some of the others. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great product, fresh lemon scent that seems to really improve the razor glide.  Light not heavy and oily like most of the pre-shave oils.</li>
            <li> This made a difference when I shaved tonight.  It has an interesting feeling and I was able to shave without getting nicks, redness or burns like I normally would.</li>
            <li> Smells very lemony which I personnaly like and works well.</li>
            <li> Assist me in getting the best shaves by far.  Four stars because it is so expensive.  I have read reviews on other sites where they just say use Olive oil.  At this price I just might.</li>
            <li> An excellent pre-shave oil, but not inexpensive.  It is light, aromatic, and sets up the beard nicely. Also lasts close to forever as four drops coats your beard efficiently.  I love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful product which really works and really helps with smoother shave and no (less) cuts.  It outperforms 3 other brands which I have used.  Only negative is it would be better if it came in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> First used in the original Barber Shop in London. Expensive but eliminates Razor Burn and is the basis for the smoothest shaves. Lasts .a long time...</li>
            <li> Excellent product, can&#x27;t shave without it!!</li>
            <li> This pre-shave oil has a great, slight lemon smell to it.  It goes on thin and does what it is supposed to do.  I get a better shave with this than I do at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product gets such high marks. It&#x27;s thin and provides very little added protection beyond your shaving cream. Try the Peterson pre-shave oil. It&#x27;s significantly better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I didn&#x27;t know about shaving oils and still don&#x27;t understand why shaving cream by itself isn&#x27;t completely adequate.  Having said that, 1) shaving oil helps provide a smoother feeling shave and 2) my blades seem to last longer.  So now I always use an oil and the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several types of shaving oil from low- to high-cost.  The lower costs oils got the job done, but the pricier oils seem to be better for one reason or another.  I.e. thicker, smell better, or (Art of Shaving) nicer bottle.  I like the Truefitt and Hill product the best of all that I have tried.  This is subjective but here are my personal reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the oil is neither so thick that it feels greasy, nor so thin that it feels useless [note that neither of these perceptions may indicate how well the oil actually does it&#x27;s job, they all seem to be better than going without];&lt;br /&gt;2) The bottle feels a tad thin, and is plastic.  This seems negative, but in fact it allows you to gently press to better control the number of drops of oil you use each time.  You lose some control with the &#x27;nicer&#x27; Art of Shaving glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;3) I love the bright lemon/citrus scent of this oil.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like it, but now look forward every morning to smelling this when I shave.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;4) Cost - yes, it is expensive, but acceptable to me given that I only use 4-5 drops per shave.</li>
            <li> If I am shaving right after a hot shower, I don&#x27;t use the pre-shave oil as my beard is already fairly soft and ready for shaving. However, for those days when I have already showered previously and don&#x27;t need to shower again, or if I&#x27;m in a hurry and just need to shave, I apply a few drops of this pre-shave oil and wait 1-2 mins for it to soak in. It makes a huge difference in shaving when using a straight razor or a double edge safety razor. Scent is citrusy, mild, and pleasant. I recommend also using the Truefitt and Hill Grafton shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Lovely. Definitely adds to a nice shaving experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different pre-shave oils. In reading shaving blogs, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The oil is very thin and watery. The description reads that it has \\&quot;Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil &amp; Meadowfoam Oil\\&quot;. I should have paid more attention to that. This oils smells like lemon. The scent reminds me of window cleaning products. I dislike it very much. For far less money, one could simply use baby oil and it would be thicker and would do the job much better. The Art of Shaving has a nice thick, rich oil at this price. I highly recommend that product (or standard baby oil) if you truly want to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I place a few drops on my whatever shave soap I am using about once a week or so. Then grab a brush and lather. All of T&amp;H&#x27;s products are excellent.</li>
            <li> Of all the razors, blades, creams, soaps, and post shave products I mix and match when I shave, this pre shave oil is a constant in the routine. Is it necessary? Hard to say definitively, but I haven&#x27;t had razor burn on my sensitive skin like I used to get frequently in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I use it? If not shaving during/after a shower, I&#x27;ll do a hot cloth over my face/neck a couple times before rubbing some of this in and wait a few minutes, then applying the shaving cream or soap. Or, if using another preshave (like Proraso Pre/Post), I&#x27;ll still put a couple drops of this on my badger hair brush once there&#x27;s some lather on it, then I face lather. It&#x27;s a little extra slickness to keep that blade gliding!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s received high ratings and I might have expected more, but I find the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil to work better.</li>
            <li> As it says on the bottle - if you have little prep time or sensitive skin, this pre-shave oil is for you!  I know some say this is either too thin or too thick, depending on their preference.  The main point I MUST stress is that you should only use 3-4 drops max.  I&#x27;ve experimented and used two to three times more and got poor results.  In fact, I would say it hurt my double edge shave performance.  But when I used a few drops, it did the job and didn&#x27;t clog the razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like this, I&#x27;m really hooked on Trumper&#x27;s West Indian Limes Skin Food.  I think the Skin Food is less greasy and does not clog pores as much.  The Skin Food is great to use before and after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth trying at least once in your life.  You may like it.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it does especially paired with their  shaving soaps and creams. Great, clean shave when used under their soaps and creams. No whisker pull at all. Almost eliminates any nicks or cuts. Your razor really does glide over your face no matter how long you&#x27;ve gone between shaves. Draw-back; it&#x27;s darned expensive</li>
            <li> Good stuff but the orange scent can be a bit strong</li>
            <li> Excellent and love the plastic bottle</li>
            <li> Really good pre shave oil, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This stuff is way overpriced and really doesn&#x27;t add anything special to my shave.  At 30 bones for two ounces, I expected more.  While the scent is nice (smells like a very bright lemoncello) it didn&#x27;t add any real additional moisture or slickness to the shave area. In fact I only gave it two stars instead of one because of the scent.  otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used it. The presentation and the bottle looks cool. But if you really want a better shave use SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL. I am not affiliated with them and neither I like to promote. But I have used quite a few expensive shave oil including After Shave, Truefit and various other name brands. But the Shave Secret was the best among all of them. Not because it&#x27;s cheap, but because it works.</li>
            <li> Greatly promotes my Baby Smooth Shave (BBS)!  Received within 3 days!  Don&#x27;t shave without this!  Order yours today!  Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the things I&#x27;ve learned about wet shaving is.... all faces are different. What works for one may not work for another. Having said that&lt;br /&gt;for me this pre shave is decent. Not really outstanding and not really poor either, just middle of the road. So for the price I don&#x27;t think I will be revisiting this product, so many more to try and sample,&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t pay attention to and am not basing my stars rating on because I feel this was my fault in not paying attention (other reviews do mention citrus) is that it smells like lemons. I really don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li> This oil works good and preparing the face prior to shaving.  It is not alcohol based, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easier as I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> It is a Sample Mini bar bottle kind of, truly way too expensive not only for its lilliput size but for being of any beneficial pre-shave effects at all.This after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> Smells good and not messy. I think it only makes a slight improvement in the shave. I will not buy again. I plan to keep on trying other pre shave products.</li>
            <li> I have used Trumpers shave cream (which is great), for awhile and thought it would be nice to get another British shaving aid, so bought the T&amp;L pre shave. Don&#x27;t bother. It&#x27;s $30 for a tiny plastic vial. Most guys shave after they shower. Well, with this stuff, after you apply it to your face you have to scub it off your hands which have turned into a greasy mess. Like spraying them with Pam. But the worst part is that the product makes no decernable difference in the shave itself. Don&#x27;t bother. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific.  Fresh lemon scent, not oily, and works quickly.  Used to use the Art of Shaving&#x27;s pre shave oil.  always felt ripped off.  Stuff was oily and, more importantly, I did not experience a discernable difference between using it or not.  The Truefitt &amp; Hill story includes supplying shave products to the royal family.  Ican see why</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Just wish it was cheaper, so down a star for price.  It does last a long time. Smells amazing. Just the right viscosity for my preference.  Oily but not pore clogging oily.  Art of Shaving was too thick, didn&#x27;t smell as good, but cheaper.  I&#x27;m back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used oil to shave before I bought this on impulse when ordering the Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream. For the past six weeks, this is the only pre-shave treatment I&#x27;ve used, not even using shave cream. Just a few drops after shower and I&#x27;m shaved and clean in a few minutes without having to whip up the foam and clean up afterword. My shave is close and my skin feels great. It travels like a champ, with much less to carry, and it&#x27;s under the TSA liquid limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a blended combination of vegetable and fruit seed oils with a citrus, predominately lemon scent. More expensive than most, but a blend of edible oils that I&#x27;d put on my skin versus inedible oils that I won&#x27;t put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am a convert.</li>
