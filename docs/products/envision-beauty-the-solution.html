    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across an article online with the 10 best moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>best part of the product is that it&#x27;s a 5-in-1 cream that is a moisturizer, anti-aging serum, eye cream, night treatment and primer all in one!  </li>
            <li>I used it on my eyes and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>best part of the product is that it&#x27;s a 5-in-1 cream that is a moisturizer, anti-aging serum, eye cream, night treatment and primer all in one!  </li>
            <li>I used it on my eyes and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>This cream has an impressive ingredient list and comes recommended by my mom</li>
            <li>but I do also think my skin has been especially bright since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, but I pair it with CoTZ SPF 40, and the two products work perfectly together for sun-protection and makeup finish before I leave the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li>If it had SPF, it would be perfect, but still - what a great product!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li>The quality and results of The Solution are just as incredible.  </li>
            <li>Not too oily, great balance, takes my redness away and works great for eyes as well as face!</li>
            <li>It goes great under makeup and is perfect for a night-time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have since changed to Dermalogica which is also pricy but have had really great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great product</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>With this product my skin immediately feels... good.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels good on the skin, but that&#x27;s about all.  </li>
            <li>Being a beauty junkie, I have to say I&#x27;ve tried all the best products available on the market.  </li>
            <li>Compared to what I used before, this feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>it just feels soo so good on my skin and is a must for wintertime.</li>
            <li>My favorite cream ever!</li>
            <li>It goes on so light, absorbs immediately, but manages to keep the skin incredibly hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it and all it promised to do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more like a gel than a cream.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>but this one truly makes the most sense.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!!!ir</li>
            <li>Getting healthy skin involves a balanced diet, exercise and taking care of yourself.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m a label reader and try to find the best possible products for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After two months I&#x27;m very happy with it and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Using hand lotion on ur face works better then this.</li>
            <li>I love this all-in-one moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>A real time saver and my skin at 61 looks better than it has in many years.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes right on with a fantastic finish!  </li>
            <li>Right now this cream is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad item, but it is nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a really nice moisturizer that goes on smooth and keeps my face soft and hydrated all day without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>One face, neck and eye lotion that does it all in one quick step.</li>
            <li>In fact, The Solution knocks those over the top creams off their high horse, and for a fraction of the price!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that was noticeable from the very first application.      </li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t crack if I smile.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>With this lotion I can minimize using other products and my skin still looks good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find the right words...</li>
            <li>I stopped using department store creams because I was wary of the ingredients they often use:  phthalates, parabens, full of chemicals to get the perfect smell or feel or look.</li>
            <li>Holy grail for sensitive, easily irritated skin...</li>
            <li>The second day I was using it, I kept looking at the mirror, because I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin looked!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s simply no short-cut or magic potion.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels heavenly, has a very mild &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent (just herbal extracts, not artificial fragrance), absorbs instantly, most importantly NO GREASINESS which I absolutely despise in a cream.</li>
            <li>Light cream, absorbs quickly, moisture lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try after seeing a bunch of positive reviews online.  </li>
            <li>It is chock full of natural ingredients like Acai, Goji, flower extracts and shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Was just getting ready to make a gift  of envision to a close friend and decided to write a review.</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and never dry.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using less products on my face.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and I can use this in the morning and evening over my whole face, as well as around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am terrified of the price ( I didn&#x27;t know it was on sale for $49, normally $89)</li>
            <li>Which I rarely do unless I am upset.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I have been using this for about 5 months and have seen an improvement in my overall appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft to the touch, it feels supple - like</li>
            <li>This product has natural ingredients and none of the known harmful ones, those on my blacklist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not great about using multiple products for different things, so it&#x27;s great to have one product that works on my forehead, around my lips, on my cheeks, on my neck, and even on the soft skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My normally shiny skin was matte and the dry patches were non-existent.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I didn&#x27;t have little flakes on my skin after I applied makeup.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy or thick layering on my face after it is applied.  </li>

            <li> I believe it is way overpriced for what it does, and it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I only use one pump sometimes, so it takes very little to moisturize your face if you have normal or oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Cellex-C left me just too dry in patches and Dermalogica made me sooo shiny.  </li>
            <li> But The Solution didn&#x27;t make it oily, and it was emollient enough to take away the dry surface.  </li>
            <li> skin is oily but dry on the surface.</li>
            <li> For dry skin maybe just two pumps.  </li>
            <li> I have combo (oily in t-zone, dry on my cheeks) skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very difficult type of skin and doesn&#x27;t respond well to most creams and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It can be dry and a little oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have to be so careful what I use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually oily and with this product it appears to be less oily and works well under my Bare Escentuals makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big beauty nut, and usually I only apply moisturizer in the morning as I&#x27;m so tired at night I just fall into bed.  </li>
            <li> Despite the natural ingredients used, The Solution has a professional look and feel and a crazy celebrity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Solution for a few months now and haven&#x27;t had a single breakout.  </li>
            <li> and when I use moisturizers on my face, usually it stings a little, or turns my skin red.  </li>
            <li> I can buy products that do that for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Product is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but no better than any other beauty product and extremely over priced.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I did, my skin felt tight and my face felt like there was this layer of... something...</li>
            <li> You just need a little.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how The Solution by Envision Beauty has transformed my skin within a few days.  </li>
            <li> few friends asked if I had any work done (which was not the case)</li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t waste your money because it does nothing and costs alot of money.</li>
            <li> I just receive envision beauty today, and extremely frustrated because the bottle is empty, it seemed to be used, yet it was carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li> this review helps someone who is on the fence, I would give it at least three months.&lt;br /&gt;Lesley</li>
            <li> No &#x27;amazing&#x27; results yet, but</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Another hyped product. I wanted to love it and all it promised to do but it was just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and sensitive skin.  For the last 30 years I have used Rachel Perry&#x27;s line of all-natural skin care products, but the company went out of business.  What to do?  What to do?  I tried everything - in every price range.  No matter what I did, my skin felt tight and my face felt like there was this layer of... something... sitting on it for hours after applying any cream.  With this product my skin immediately feels... good.  I&#x27;m trying to find the right words... my skin feels soft to the touch, it feels supple - like it won&#x27;t crack if I smile.  And that was noticeable from the very first application.      I&#x27;m not a big beauty nut, and usually I only apply moisturizer in the morning as I&#x27;m so tired at night I just fall into bed.  This product does work, even used as seldom as I use it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I started using this about a month ago and am already on my second bottle.  Light cream, absorbs quickly, moisture lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I just receive envision beauty today, and extremely frustrated because the bottle is empty, it seemed to be used, yet it was carefully wrapped. I was cheated, wasn&#x27;t I? I bought it $90 ...how can a relIable web that let this happen.i will never buy anything of this web :\\&quot;(</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this lotion and I am very happy with the texture of my skin. My skin is usually oily and with this product it appears to be less oily and works well under my Bare Escentuals makeup. I am enjoying using less products on my face. With this lotion I can minimize using other products and my skin still looks good.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.  I have rosacea and have to be so careful what I use.  It not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea but I have noticed a decrease in the redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now.  No &#x27;amazing&#x27; results yet, but my skin is definitely clearer and has a glow.  It&#x27;s really more like a gel than a cream.  The smell is okay and I like that they use essential oils instead of synthetic scents.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it for the smell but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for my skin. I have since changed to Dermalogica which is also pricy but have had really great results.</li>
            <li> I have tried every moisturizer on the planet to no avail.  I was using Cellex-C, Dermalogica and others.  Cellex-C left me just too dry in patches and Dermalogica made me sooo shiny.  I was getting frustrated.  I stumbled across an article online with the 10 best moisturizers.  I saw Envision Beauty so started doing some research and reading reviews.  I found it here on Amazon for $49 so decided to try it.  Within 2 days I was hooked.  My normally shiny skin was matte and the dry patches were non-existent.  I am terrified of the price ( I didn&#x27;t know it was on sale for $49, normally $89) but I love it.  I will ask for it for Birthdays and Christmas from my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of beauty products over the years but this one truly makes the most sense.  I get everything I need and it&#x27;s all in one bottle.  Not to mention the fact that my skin has never looked better.  I noticed it within the first few days.  Before, I was using 3 to 4 different products to get what I needed.  The problem is that mixing these different products would cause me to break out here and there.  I&#x27;ve been using The Solution for a few months now and haven&#x27;t had a single breakout.  It&#x27;s really a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad item, but it is nothing extraordinary.  I believe it is way overpriced for what it does, and it does not last long.  It looks and feels good on the skin, but that&#x27;s about all.  I can buy products that do that for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy so I can use it during the day under makeup and at night, too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how The Solution by Envision Beauty has transformed my skin within a few days.  It goes on so light, absorbs immediately, but manages to keep the skin incredibly hydrated and smooth.  Makeup goes right on with a fantastic finish!  The second day I was using it, I kept looking at the mirror, because I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin looked!  The only type of product I can compare it to is Sisley&#x27;s $500 cream, or Amore Pacific&#x27;s $400 cream.  Being a beauty junkie, I have to say I&#x27;ve tried all the best products available on the market.  The quality and results of The Solution are just as incredible.  In fact, The Solution knocks those over the top creams off their high horse, and for a fraction of the price!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily but dry on the surface. It&#x27;s a very difficult type of skin and doesn&#x27;t respond well to most creams and moisturizers.  But The Solution didn&#x27;t make it oily, and it was emollient enough to take away the dry surface.  For the first time I didn&#x27;t have little flakes on my skin after I applied makeup.  You just need a little.  I only use one pump sometimes, so it takes very little to moisturize your face if you have normal or oily skin.  For dry skin maybe just two pumps.  It also has Vitamin A, which helps with aging and wrinkling, and Vitamin C for glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I check and read ingredients when I purchase a product. This product has natural ingredients and none of the known harmful ones, those on my blacklist.  I stopped using department store creams because I was wary of the ingredients they often use:  phthalates, parabens, full of chemicals to get the perfect smell or feel or look. The Solution has no parabens, no mineral oil, no phthalates, no propylene glycol.  It is chock full of natural ingredients like Acai, Goji, flower extracts and shea butter.  Despite the natural ingredients used, The Solution has a professional look and feel and a crazy celebrity following (which I found out on their website from all their press clips!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the product is that it&#x27;s a 5-in-1 cream that is a moisturizer, anti-aging serum, eye cream, night treatment and primer all in one!  I used it on my eyes and it worked great!  I LOVE this product!!!ir press clips!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the product is that it&#x27;s a 5-in-1 cream that is a moisturizer, anti-aging serum, eye cream, night treatment and primer all in one!

            <li> Getting healthy skin involves a balanced diet, exercise and taking care of yourself. There&#x27;s simply no short-cut or magic potion.  That said, I&#x27;m a label reader and try to find the best possible products for myself.  This cream has an impressive ingredient list and comes recommended by my mom so I&#x27;m giving it a try.  The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a really nice moisturizer that goes on smooth and keeps my face soft and hydrated all day without being greasy.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s so it&#x27;s not like a moisturizer is going to give me a facelift but I do also think my skin has been especially bright since I started using it.  Right now this cream is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Compared to what I used before, this feels good on my skin and I can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Finally! One face, neck and eye lotion that does it all in one quick step. A real time saver and my skin at 61 looks better than it has in many years. This is the only time I have joined for regular shipments and not regretted it!</li>
            <li> Product is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but no better than any other beauty product and extremely over priced.  Advertising says this is all you will ever need, but I beg to differ.</li>
            <li> Was just getting ready to make a gift  of envision to a close friend and decided to write a review. Which I rarely do unless I am upset.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I have been using this for about 5 months and have seen an improvement in my overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;A few friends asked if I had any work done (which was not the case) so I  am not going to stop using this.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps someone who is on the fence, I would give it at least three months.&lt;br /&gt;Lesley</li>
            <li> This cream feels luxurious. It really does.  Holy grail for sensitive, easily irritated skin... I have combo (oily in t-zone, dry on my cheeks) skin and when I use moisturizers on my face, usually it stings a little, or turns my skin red.  This cream feels heavenly, has a very mild &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent (just herbal extracts, not artificial fragrance), absorbs instantly, most importantly NO GREASINESS which I absolutely despise in a cream. it just feels soo so good on my skin and is a must for wintertime.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream ever! Not too oily, great balance, takes my redness away and works great for eyes as well as face!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am 48 years old and I can use this in the morning and evening over my whole face, as well as around my eyes. I have problem skin. It can be dry and a little oily at the same time. Because of this I have a tendency to have a pimple here and there. While using this product I have no breakouts. My skin is soft and smooth and never dry. It is a great product. I would say that you are not going to see miracles, but you will see improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after seeing a bunch of positive reviews online.  After two months I&#x27;m very happy with it and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t waste your money because it does nothing and costs alot of money. Using hand lotion on ur face works better then this.</li>
            <li> I love this all-in-one moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not great about using multiple products for different things, so it&#x27;s great to have one product that works on my forehead, around my lips, on my cheeks, on my neck, and even on the soft skin around my eyes.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy or thick layering on my face after it is applied.  It goes great under makeup and is perfect for a night-time moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, but I pair it with CoTZ SPF 40, and the two products work perfectly together for sun-protection and makeup finish before I leave the house in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I can&#x27;t sing the praises highly enough.  If it had SPF, it would be perfect, but still - what a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
