            <li>I love that stuff!</li>
            <li>Liked this a lot.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of heavy/waxy.</li>

            <li>I love the price also.  </li>
            <li>I know for sure you will regret it if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but didn&#x27;t see any results and soon stopped using.</li>
            <li>sure not hurting it any.</li>
            <li>I can see excellent results already only after 2weeks.</li>
            <li>Purchasing this for a second time because it&#x27;s so wonderful!</li>
            <li>In looking for something safe, yet comparable, I found glycolic acid cream.</li>
            <li>It does sting and itch for about 15 minutes after application, but then I wake up in the morning with baby smooth skin!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>This is a good and economical alternative.</li>
            <li>I do see some improvement and better looking skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is just okay.</li>
            <li>Not MD Forte, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I have sun damage and this product did a great job to cause irritation that causes your body to create new smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit too strong for my face.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter than the other, which can be good in the summer but the effects are equally good.</li>
            <li>This is the best replacement hands down.</li>
            <li>If you have sun damage or fine lines</li>
            <li>It also has helped with fine lines and wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li>My skin looks pretty damn good right now.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Creamy, not greasy in any way, and my skin does look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The good thing I noticed is the exfoliation process began very quickly with tiny scales breaking up on the skin as you wash it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be a customer of this product for life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using glycolic acid gels/creams for many years; first for breakouts, now for the anti-aging.</li>
            <li>As for the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, I no longer feel it as I have been using it for many years consistently.</li>
            <li>Smells weird and is grainy~but~my skin is happy, happy.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I actually have better results with this cream than Retin A...</li>
            <li>Use it often and my face looks really nice, for being old!</li>
            <li>Using it for old acne scars, I can see some improvement and think it will be getting a lot better over time of using this!</li>
            <li>I have used other glycolic cream with 30% that have been much more effective.</li>
            <li>My wife is looking young the more the uses this cream on her face.....</li>
            <li>It does burn a bit when skin is freshly exfoliated.</li>
            <li>No peeling and chronic dry spots, just smooth, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>stuff has an odd bright orange coloring to it.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonable (at 1/3 cost) compared to MD Forte&#x27;s Glycolic Cream III and results</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I needed something with more % of glycolic and finally I got this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace Glycoderma 25% glycolic acid cream that I could no longer find and it is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>Pores are smaller, dark spots and fine lines reduced, no breakouts  and makeup goes on better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 weeks, but had to back off because I was using it in combination with a peel and serum, which turned out to be too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My face has a certain glow to it.</li>
            <li>When you put it on there is no tingly/burning feeling which I have experienced with every single other glycolic product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>In one week only, my skin was as smooth as baby face. .</li>
            <li>I added some of it to another anti-aging cream with Q10 and it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin, in fact, I&#x27;ve noticed areas of congestion in my skin since I started to use it.  </li>
            <li>shhhhhh it made my face really oily</li>
            <li>I really like the cream.</li>
            <li>Who wants wax on their face?</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and getting clearer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Typically gycolic cream will make an instant difference, it will dissolve any flaky spots I have and leave my skin feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li>Still on the search for a high % glycolic face cream.</li>
            <li>But Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have only been using a few days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>and she asked me what I was using in normal life.</li>
            <li>On my second jar and really like the product!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have to add that as I&#x27;ve reached near the end of the jar</li>
            <li>Feel the sting, but my face feels so soft the next day....</li>
            <li>I tried this, and it felt very heavy going on, didn&#x27;t feel like it was being absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen major results with my dark spots (melasma).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tried this, and it felt very heavy going on, didn&#x27;t feel like it was being absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen major results with my dark spots (melasma).</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using Retin A to keep wrinkles, sun spots and blemishes at bay, but I had to stop due to the potential dangers during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Different than the other glycolic acid creams that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It definitely exfoliates the skin, which I need in order to fade dark spots and even my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the cream actually contains 30% glycolic acid, but it does contain enough that you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as moisturizing as I had expected.</li>
            <li> so you must be careful to not overdue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products with 12% that have a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; to them.  </li>
            <li> I use to fade scars I have on my face due to a car accident 9 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and doesn&#x27;t give me that tingle that other GA creams give me.  </li>
            <li> I also had spots on my face that seem to be less visible now.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s feels like a lot less than that.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little off putting, but the product works well.</li>
            <li> Yes it has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that the sting is less, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to it or the product lost its potency...</li>
            <li> I had a few small spots on my hand and after using this product they are gone.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t compare to the 25% Glycolic Cream I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it still has some qualities.</li>
            <li> Over the course of a few days, my skin started to break out, so I read the ingredients, and it contains WAX!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately is it hard to come by and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its hard to find.</li>
            <li> they dont make a day cream with at least 20% of glycolic....</li>
            <li> This product has a bad odor, does not feel like it has glycolic at 30%.</li>
            <li> I rate this item base on fact it work for my face and not the look of the container or packaging</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Liked this a lot. Use it often and my face looks really nice, for being old! ;)</li>
            <li> My wife is looking young the more the uses this cream on her face.....</li>
            <li> There is no way this cream has 30% glycolic acid.  Can&#x27;t feel it at all.  I&#x27;ve used other products with 12% that have a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; to them.  Also, it&#x27;s kind of heavy/waxy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Please keep making it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using glycolic acid (MD formulation) for years now, and some how decided to try ASDM beverly hills. Miracles!!!! In one week only, my skin was as smooth as baby face. . Feel much better on the skin when you put it on, and the results.... My skin looks and feels much younger. There is nothing to compare with the MD formulation. It was above all my expectations.</li>
            <li> This cream makes an OVERNIGHT DIFFERENCE! luminousity and skin texture improved immediately. Even my 13 year olf son said, &amp;#34;Mom your skin looks good even without makeup,&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s saying quite alot. Especially effective after exposure to sun, etc. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the grainy texture of the product. Not quite as moisturizing as I had expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I used MD Forte for years : then it was discontinued. This is the best replacement hands down. I have sensitive skin. I have lots of complements on my skin&lt;br /&gt;using these products.</li>
            <li> Glad to find a 30% cream since mine was discontinued. Consistency is different but seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few days and so far so good. I was using Glycoderma 25 refining facial cream and it was great, but can&#x27;t find it anymore, so I am hoping your cream works as good.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream but it&#x27;s a bit too strong for my face.  I added some of it to another anti-aging cream with Q10 and it seems to be working very well.  The good thing I noticed is the exfoliation process began very quickly with tiny scales breaking up on the skin as you wash it.  I use it at night only.  My discoloration is slowing fading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gritty and greasy. Different than the other glycolic acid creams that I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s heavy and doesn&#x27;t give me that tingle that other GA creams give me.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin, in fact, I&#x27;ve noticed areas of congestion in my skin since I started to use it.  (I do like the sample of microdermabrasian cream they sent me.)</li>
            <li> I do not think this is a 30% glycolic cream.  So far I have not seen major results with my dark spots (melasma). It does leaves my skin nice and smooth and it is ok as an every day cream. I have been using it for 3 weeks. Will continue to use to see if melasma decreases.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product. It is not greasy or sticky. It has a smooth texture. I can see an improvement in my skin tone. It appears smoother and shinier. I like it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very powerful, great for removing brown spots.  I had a few small spots on my hand and after using this product they are gone.  It is very strong so you must be careful to not overdue.  It is also wonderful to renew your chest skin.  I have sun damage and this product did a great job to cause irritation that causes your body to create new smooth skin.  If you have sun damage or fine lines this is the product to get.</li>
            <li> shhhhhh it made my face really oily</li>
            <li> Great Glycolic acid cream.. Feel the sting, but my face feels so soft the next day....</li>
            <li> I rate this item base on fact it work for my face and not the look of the container or packaging</li>
            <li> On my second jar and really like the product!  Very nice Glycolic Cream</li>
            <li> Been using this cream for 3 weeks and I see  remarkable differnences..  My skin looks clean,well rested and wrinkles diminished.  It seems that this works better than MD forte III face cream.  I love the price also.  You must try this cream. I know for sure you will regret it if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product has a bad odor, does not feel like it has glycolic at 30%. I have used other glycolic cream with 30% that have been much more effective. Feels greasy and gritty on my skin. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Hoped this would be a good replacement for MD Forte III that I had used for 20 years.  It was okay, but didn&#x27;t see any results and soon stopped using.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night time treatment. Smells weird and is grainy~but~my skin is happy, happy. It does burn a bit when skin is freshly exfoliated.</li>
            <li> My skin looks pretty damn good right now.  Is it this cream?  Don&#x27;t know, but&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s sure not hurting it any. Creamy, not greasy in any way, and my skin does look fabulous.  Hum......</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month &amp; like the results.  It makes my skin very smooth and radiant.  It was very reasonable (at 1/3 cost) compared to MD Forte&#x27;s Glycolic Cream III and results are very good.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t compare to the 25% Glycolic Cream I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it still has some qualities. My face has a certain glow to it. I also had spots on my face that seem to be less visible now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find something to replace my &amp;#34;MD Forte III&amp;#34; which is 30% glycolic acid. This product says it&#x27;s 30% percent glycolic but it&#x27;s feels like a lot less than that.</li>
            <li> I really like the cream. I can see excellent results already only after 2weeks. I just wish I could get it in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> I tried this, and it felt very heavy going on, didn&#x27;t feel like it was being absorbed. Over the course of a few days, my skin started to break out, so I read the ingredients, and it contains WAX! Who wants wax on their face?</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using Glycoderm 25% cream. I love that stuff! Unfortunately is it hard to come by and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has an odd bright orange coloring to it. When you put it on there is no tingly/burning feeling which I have experienced with every single other glycolic product I have ever used. Makes me question the accuracy of the 30% claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically gycolic cream will make an instant difference, it will dissolve any flaky spots I have and leave my skin feeling very fresh. This product has not done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase it again. Still on the search for a high % glycolic face cream.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this for a second time because it&#x27;s so wonderful! Prior to this I was using Retin A to keep wrinkles, sun spots and blemishes at bay, but I had to stop due to the potential dangers during pregnancy. In looking for something safe, yet comparable, I found glycolic acid cream. I can honestly say that I actually have better results with this cream than Retin A... No peeling and chronic dry spots, just smooth, healthy looking skin. Pores are smaller, dark spots and fine lines reduced, no breakouts  and makeup goes on better! It does sting and itch for about 15 minutes after application, but then I wake up in the morning with baby smooth skin! I have to add that as I&#x27;ve reached near the end of the jar, I&#x27;ve noticed that the sting is less, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to it or the product lost its potency...either way I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be a customer of this product for life. Loving my skin!</li>
            <li> not the best, that;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I used to use 25% glycoderma but I cant buy it anymore. Its hard to find. I needed something with more % of glycolic and finally I got this product! love it. Skin is smooth and looks healthy. I already bought it 2x and I will use it for rest of my life..... Such shame they dont make a day cream with at least 20% of glycolic.... But Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks.  My face is much smoother and getting clearer.  Hoping it will help in getting rid of my brown spots.</li>
            <li> Not MD Forte, but pretty good. The texture is a little off putting, but the product works well. I&#x27;ve been using MD for 20 years. This is a good and economical alternative.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr Oz that Glycolic Acid cream would help with decolletage wrinkles. It actually works. It also has helped with fine lines and wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li> Too much yellow dye. Results about the same as an over the counter generic moisturizer. Not with the price.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well. I use to fade scars I have on my face due to a car accident 9 yrs ago. I do see some improvement and better looking skin. Received product in a timely manner and in great condition. Would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace Glycoderma 25% glycolic acid cream that I could no longer find and it is just as good, if not better. Yes it has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it but it dissolves when massaged in. It is lighter than the other, which can be good in the summer but the effects are equally good. I&#x27;ve been using glycolic acid gels/creams for many years; first for breakouts, now for the anti-aging. As for the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, I no longer feel it as I have been using it for many years consistently. Perhaps those that don&#x27;t feel it are d/t skin being conditioned for the acid. I was told by a facialist that my skin could take alot of chemical exfolioant and she asked me what I was using in normal life. THIS IS IT, Ladies!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, arrived quick, just like described. Good product for my face! Using it for old acne scars, I can see some improvement and think it will be getting a lot better over time of using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the cream actually contains 30% glycolic acid, but it does contain enough that you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.  I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 weeks, but had to back off because I was using it in combination with a peel and serum, which turned out to be too strong for my skin.  It definitely exfoliates the skin, which I need in order to fade dark spots and even my skin tone.  But, I still want something that works faster on my undereye circles, like immediately gone.</li>
            <li> This cream is just okay. There&#x27;s no way there&#x27;s 30% glycolic acid! It doesn&#x27;t even come close to MD forte facial lotion three.</li>
