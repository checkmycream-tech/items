            <li>I love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, it really cleans the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Simply the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t seem authentic.</li>
            <li>Outstanding for dental care.</li>
            <li>Good replacement head and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Better than the original head.</li>
            <li>Better then the one that came with my Sonicare originally.</li>
            <li>clean better than the standar brush</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean. :)</li>
            <li>but you can easily get 4-6 months out of them.</li>
            <li>They fit.</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The Diamond head replacement brushes fit as well, but for the Intercare, skip the Pro replacement heads, they don&#x27;t fit regardless of what others may say.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I decided to try them because after having Invisalign I was having some problems with my gums receding and becoming super sensitve where I had the attachments.  </li>
            <li>Gums WAY healthier and teeth in WAY cleaner with this system than regular brush (better be for the cost!!)</li>
            <li>These are the genuine brush heads that came with my original purchase.</li>
            <li>The sanitize area not only works great but quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just replacing original brushes.  </li>
            <li>gets my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought these, paying much more than I could get the Diamond Clean variety for at a big box store, because I was given a couple of them to try for free as a Vine reviewer, and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and really have to have these heads for it.  </li>
            <li>They really get into problem areas and keep them very clean.  </li>
            <li>Item as described, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Super convenient to buy these via subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>have one tooth implant and if you&#x27;ve ever had an implant you learn that food can get stuck in new places as the implant tooth sits on top of the gum rather than being surrounded by it.</li>
            <li>Slightly cheaper here than elsewhere, but they are great heads.</li>
            <li>much better than my old one</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost</li>
            <li>This is the best one if someone is looking for a toothbrush that cleans deep between tainted teeth due to drinking tea or coffee.</li>
            <li>and they fit as described and feel as natural as the original ones that came on our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but, Good product, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>so was expecting a higher price</li>
            <li>The first time bristles from one brush head fell out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li>They do exactly what they claim to do.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They do clean more in between teeth than the other sonicare brush head types.</li>
            <li>definitely makes my teeth a lot whiter and super clean.</li>
            <li>I switched from Braun Oral-B which I used daily for more than a decade, and whose replacement heads were also pricey, but not as much as these Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>It really feels like it&#x27;s getting in between my teeth better than the standard brush.  </li>
            <li>And getting them from Amazon makes them pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like the extra brush tufts intended to clean between teeth (the aspect some reviewers complain about), and they seem essential to this better between-tooth performance.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine, the packaging requires scissors or a power tool to get open.  </li>
            <li>I have to replace them every month, but the result is so good that I am willing to forget about the ridiculous cost.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with braces and reaching all tooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li>work very well, but too exspensive</li>
            <li>bought Sonicare toothbrushes for my whole family.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping,</li>
            <li>Works much better than a standard tooth brush by far.</li>
            <li>I worried that it felt a little firm at first, but it really does a great job and has not worn out as quickly as the others I tried.</li>
            <li>I find that these last longer and leave my teeth cleaner than the original heads that came with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Clean feels like I just left the dentist after cleaning, except my gums do not hurt!!</li>
            <li>I use the Clean, Whitening and Gum setting (3 min. total) every morning and night.</li>
            <li>I feel like these get my teeth much cleaner than the normal compact heads.  </li>
            <li>They seem to work better for me, while not being too &#x27;hard&#x27; and I&#x27;ve decided that when all is said and done they&#x27;re worth</li>
            <li>I tried a different brand and was so glad I went back to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>a four for two reasons: first, two heads should have been included with the pricey Sonicare power unit I purchased, and second, the replacements heads are very pricey.</li>
            <li>This one is well worth all those extra dollars.  </li>
            <li>Outside of the available 6-packs of Sonicare Intercare brush heads, this is a decent deal, and the 3 heads will last 9 months.</li>
            <li>This cannot be said of some of the other styles of brush heads widely available in the non-electronic market.  </li>
            <li>Is much smaller and easier to fit on my tiny counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are comparatively more expensive than others which will also fit.</li>
            <li>After starting with the Sonicare Jan. 1, my first cleaning/checkup at the dentist was May 1.  </li>
            <li>You simply cannot get your teeth this clean with a regular brush or with one of those $10 battery vibrating brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to seem them come down in price per head, but they do work and help keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, items as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li>teeth feel cleaner, my mouth feels fresher that it did with my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an earlier version that died after much service.  </li>
            <li>My teeth become much cleaner than the regular heads!</li>
            <li>Work wonderfully, last much longer than the wear indicators.</li>
            <li>good product and everything but kinda expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it to keep your hygienist from yelling at you!</li>
            <li>This vibrates at a much faster rate, so much so that it took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>When I finally had to purchase a new Sonicare (my A-series just kept going and going), it came with this head included.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected, just wish they did not cost so darn much.</li>
            <li>Expensive but Effective</li>
            <li>These work great, but I wish they lasted longer or were less expensive.</li>
            <li>These particular heads seem to be long lasting.</li>

            <li> This one is well worth all those extra dollars.  </li>
            <li> Outside of the available 6-packs of Sonicare Intercare brush heads, this is a decent deal, and the 3 heads will last 9 months.</li>
            <li> This cannot be said of some of the other styles of brush heads widely available in the non-electronic market.  </li>
            <li> Is much smaller and easier to fit on my tiny counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are comparatively more expensive than others which will also fit.</li>
            <li> After starting with the Sonicare Jan. 1, my first cleaning/checkup at the dentist was May 1.  </li>
            <li> You simply cannot get your teeth this clean with a regular brush or with one of those $10 battery vibrating brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to seem them come down in price per head, but they do work and help keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, items as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li> teeth feel cleaner, my mouth feels fresher that it did with my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an earlier version that died after much service.  </li>
            <li> My teeth become much cleaner than the regular heads!</li>
            <li> Work wonderfully, last much longer than the wear indicators.</li>
            <li> good product and everything but kinda expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it to keep your hygienist from yelling at you!</li>
            <li> This vibrates at a much faster rate, so much so that it took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> When I finally had to purchase a new Sonicare (my A-series just kept going and going), it came with this head included.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, just wish they did not cost so darn much.</li>
            <li> Expensive but Effective</li>
            <li> These work great, but I wish they lasted longer or were less expensive.</li>
            <li> These particular heads seem to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with this bad boy!</li>
            <li> The extra long bristles help get</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as they used to the decrease in quality is noticeable</li>
            <li> In The Rear end Flossing,  I&#x27;m going back to the old style brushes that are green and white and do the job.</li>
            <li> My teeth are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, but I knew that when I bought it so otherwise its fine</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars due to cost.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;intercare&amp;#34; brushes were not like any of the other InterCare brushes I have been getting for the last two years.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these were the answer to flossing but the HARD HEAVY Yellow bristles that stick out further and are suppose to get between your teeth are so hard they will not let the other softer bristles come in contact with the surface of my teeth, They may work better for you if you have wide gaps between your teeth which would let the stiff bristles get between your teeth, But if you have teeth like mine</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> it is not readily available in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  </li>
            <li> These are brush heads, so there&#x27;s not much to review.  </li>
            <li> Requires little space even near a small sink area.</li>
            <li> They are a little expensive but worth it IMO</li>
            <li> They are firm, but not too rough on the gums.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few of the other heads</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter and gums are healthier and in between is less tender.</li>
            <li> Price issues aside, I consider it a five star product at this time, but I have owned it less than a year, so time will tell if it holds up.</li>
            <li> The packaging is insanely difficult to open, even with manicure scissors, but of course, I finally managed.</li>
            <li> Problem is they are expensive and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Usually by now there is at least some starting to show.</li>
            <li> Not much more I can say except these work extremely well.</li>
            <li> For as little as it takes to make these, these sonic brush heads are overly priced.  </li>
            <li> Bought the first version from my very expensive dentist, so I can say that it is dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> They were the least expensive ones I could find, so I&#x27;ll rate them highly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> but they are still in tact and difficult to reach with a traditional brush.  </li>
            <li> These are very expensive brush heads but seem to get my teeth cleaner than the standard brush heads</li>
            <li> It times you for 30 seconds for each &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; by a subtle beep.</li>
            <li> I found them a little expensive, but I gotta have &#x27;em</li>
            <li> and you have a hard time even getting thin Dental Floss between them</li>
            <li> Expensive (reason for 4 stars), but this works.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but a must have for my toothbrush with a &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> expensive and although called interdent does not do job.</li>
            <li> They came in Sonicare packaging but something seemed fake.</li>
            <li> Very, very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed that this item is promoted as a 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my dentist will hate me anymore!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What to say, they work!!  :)</li>
            <li> This is the best one if someone is looking for a toothbrush that cleans deep between tainted teeth due to drinking tea or coffee.</li>
            <li> definitely makes my teeth a lot whiter and super clean.</li>
            <li> I think the price for these is great. I paid over 120 for my tooth brush so was expecting a higher price</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper here than elsewhere, but they are great heads. They do clean more in between teeth than the other sonicare brush head types.</li>
            <li> clean better than the standar brush</li>
            <li> as always, great products...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and really have to have these heads for it.  They really get into problem areas and keep them very clean.  Amazon is the only place I can get these heads as no one stocks them locally.</li>
            <li> I bought these, paying much more than I could get the Diamond Clean variety for at a big box store, because I was given a couple of them to try for free as a Vine reviewer, and I love them.  They seem to work better for me, while not being too &#x27;hard&#x27; and I&#x27;ve decided that when all is said and done they&#x27;re worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one tooth implant and if you&#x27;ve ever had an implant you learn that food can get stuck in new places as the implant tooth sits on top of the gum rather than being surrounded by it. I floss, but food can get places that floss can&#x27;t reach and this brush helps a lot.</li>
            <li> very disappointed that this item is promoted as a 3-pack.  Only two brush heads were received.</li>
            <li> Original equipment brushes at an attractive price. Now have spared when time to change.</li>
            <li> I find that these last longer and leave my teeth cleaner than the original heads that came with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> good tooth brush, Good price.</li>
            <li> What can you say about toothbrush replacement heads? They work. They fit. My teeth are clean. :)</li>
            <li> The intercare brush heads are shaped perfectly to allow efficient brushing of BOTH the front and the back of the teeth. This cannot be said of some of the other styles of brush heads widely available in the non-electronic market.  According to my dentist, this brush head took my gums from worrisome to excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could one with my daughters sonicare. I love the results</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to see my dentist quite as often.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations. Teeth are whiter and gums are healthier and in between is less tender.</li>
            <li> Needed replacements for my sonicare. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> If you own the Intercare toothbrush then you know how good these heads are.  I found them for a good price on Amazon and received them quickly.  I love the Philips Sonicare product line.</li>
            <li> Great price, exactly like the brush head that came with our Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Outside of the available 6-packs of Sonicare Intercare brush heads, this is a decent deal, and the 3 heads will last 9 months.</li>
            <li> These work just like the ones that came with the sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product. The first time bristles from one brush head fell out the first time I used it. Hopefully I will have better luck with this order.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with braces and reaching all tooth surfaces.  Holds a charge for many days.  Requires little space even near a small sink area.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase. I found the refill head I was looking for - it is not readily available in the local stores.</li>
            <li> work very well, but too exspensive</li>
            <li> So far so good. We like these and they fit as described and feel as natural as the original ones that came on our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Not much more I can say except these work extremely well. The extra long bristles help get debris between teeth and these brushes seem to last a lot longer than the last rendition.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as they used to the decrease in quality is noticeable</li>
            <li> Expensive but Effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rated this a four for two reasons: first, two heads should have been included with the pricey Sonicare power unit I purchased, and second, the replacements heads are very pricey. That said, I will continue to use the Sonicare, and I will continue to use the replacement heads. I switched from Braun Oral-B which I used daily for more than a decade, and whose replacement heads were also pricey, but not as much as these Sonicare heads. BTW: I found it takes sometime to become accustomed to the Sonicare - it has a very different sensation when brushing. Price issues aside, I consider it a five star product at this time, but I have owned it less than a year, so time will tell if it holds up. Also, from my experience I consider Philips to be a top rate company.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. Definitely learned my lesson about buying the bargain brand.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  would order again.</li>
            <li> Love my sonic are toothbrush</li>
            <li> Service was great.  Cost Was great.  However this head it&#x27;s a bit too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, just wish they did not cost so darn much.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist and after using it I understood why.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel cleaner, my mouth feels fresher that it did with my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> much better than my old one</li>
            <li> I had a $90ish dollar version of this. This one is well worth all those extra dollars.  Noticeably cleaner mouth, incleading between teeth. Is much smaller and easier to fit on my tiny counter. Charge lasts a long time. Really great product. I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> the performance of this product is phenomenal !!  I liked it so well, I bought one for my wife.  She like it so well, we are buying another for our vacation cabin.  Clean feels like I just left the dentist after cleaning, except my gums do not hurt!!</li>
            <li> Good replacement head and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Better than the original head.</li>
            <li> When I finally had to purchase a new Sonicare (my A-series just kept going and going), it came with this head included.  I tried a few of the other heads but this is the best design.  I worried that it felt a little firm at first, but it really does a great job and has not worn out as quickly as the others I tried. I would recommend the Intercare Brush Head!</li>
            <li> Expensive (reason for 4 stars), but this works.  After starting with the Sonicare Jan. 1, my first cleaning/checkup at the dentist was May 1.  4 months of use has improved the cleanliness of my teeth and quality of my gums - according to my dentist, not just me.  His rating for my evaluation went from a Good rating at the last visit to an Excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Sonicare toothbrushes for my whole family.  I use the Clean, Whitening and Gum setting (3 min. total) every morning and night.</li>
            <li> Cleans the junk from my teeth</li>
            <li> I do like this brush.  It really feels like it&#x27;s getting in between my teeth better than the standard brush.  The packaging is insanely difficult to open, even with manicure scissors, but of course, I finally managed.</li>
            <li> Prefect (excellent results )</li>
            <li> A little pricey but, Good product, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  Just replacing original brushes.  I love the Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. No need to spend money on the diamond cut. These work just as well. They say to change them every 3 months but you can easily get 4-6 months out of them.</li>
            <li> Item as described, quick delivery. Fits my sonic toothbrush and does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are comparatively more expensive than others which will also fit. The brush heads work great and get the teeth clean!</li>
            <li> good product and everything but kinda expensive</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine, the packaging requires scissors or a power tool to get open.  Very, very frustrating.  Is this the best that can be done?</li>
            <li> Expensive but a must have for my toothbrush with a &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; setting.  Only gave 4 stars due to cost.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they claim to do. Problem is they are expensive and don&#x27;t last long. I have to replace them every month, but the result is so good that I am willing to forget about the ridiculous cost. Those are by far the best brush heads sonicare has to offer (I&#x27;ve tried them all).</li>
            <li> I love the upgrades to the Sonicare.  The sanitize area not only works great but quickly.  I tried a different brand and was so glad I went back to the Sonicare. This has to be the number one electronic toothbrush on the market today.  Well worth the cost</li>
            <li> These work great, but I wish they lasted longer or were less expensive.</li>
            <li> It fit the toothbrush and seems to be of good quality. I would by here again</li>
            <li> works great!  cleans my teeth really well and does a great job.  Works much better than a standard tooth brush by far.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare!  Philips is a quality company who makes sure you&#x27;re satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are the genuine brush heads that came with my original purchase. Works great.</li>
            <li> The extended bristles help get in between the teeth. They are firm, but not too rough on the gums.  Solid construction. Better then the one that came with my Sonicare originally.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an earlier version that died after much service.  I love the Philips Sonicare -- gets my teeth really clean.  Bought the first version from my very expensive dentist, so I can say that it is dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> I like these brush heads. They are a little expensive but worth it IMO and Amazon has the best prices I have seen on them.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Last longer than the regular flex care toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Good tool for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> Always work well -- much better than the after-market ones. And getting them from Amazon makes them pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads.  I decided to try them because after having Invisalign I was having some problems with my gums receding and becoming super sensitve where I had the attachments.  Anyway, I saw that they claimed to promote healthier gums so I figured I&#x27;d try them.  It&#x27;s been a month or two and I can feel the difference.  My teeth are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast shipping,</li>
            <li> love these heads! My teeth become much cleaner than the regular heads!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic. I had an Oral B and it&#x27;s nothing compared to the Sonicare. This vibrates at a much faster rate, so much so that it took a little getting used to. It times you for 30 seconds for each &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; by a subtle beep. You can change times too. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and can detect no plaque. Usually by now there is at least some starting to show. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it to keep your hygienist from yelling at you!</li>
            <li> I feel like these get my teeth much cleaner than the normal compact heads.  I like the extra brush tufts intended to clean between teeth (the aspect some reviewers complain about), and they seem essential to this better between-tooth performance.</li>
            <li> These are brush heads, so there&#x27;s not much to review.  They were the least expensive ones I could find, so I&#x27;ll rate them highly.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, it really cleans the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Hey, they&#x27;re toothbrushes - same as what came with the Sonicare from the dentist. Work wonderfully, last much longer than the wear indicators. Gums WAY healthier and teeth in WAY cleaner with this system than regular brush (better be for the cost!!)</li>
            <li> Have not had to use these yet but the Sonicare is the best product out there</li>
            <li> expensive and although called interdent does not do job. If you do not floss you run risk of periodontal disease. buy cheaper offering and use floss.  rs florida</li>
            <li> only received 2 of 3 brush heads</li>
            <li> I was hoping these were the answer to flossing but the HARD HEAVY Yellow bristles that stick out further and are suppose to get between your teeth are so hard they will not let the other softer bristles come in contact with the surface of my teeth, They may work better for you if you have wide gaps between your teeth which would let the stiff bristles get between your teeth, But if you have teeth like mine and you have a hard time even getting thin Dental Floss between them then these are not the answer to regular Pain In The Rear end Flossing,  I&#x27;m going back to the old style brushes that are green and white and do the job.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, items as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush on the market. These particular heads seem to be long lasting. I found them a little expensive, but I gotta have &#x27;em</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is awesome, and these brush heads fit, that&#x27;s all that is needed.  The Diamond head replacement brushes fit as well, but for the Intercare, skip the Pro replacement heads, they don&#x27;t fit regardless of what others may say.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I don&#x27;t think my dentist will hate me anymore! You simply cannot get your teeth this clean with a regular brush or with one of those $10 battery vibrating brushes. I only have 2 wisdom teeth but they are still in tact and difficult to reach with a traditional brush.  Easy to clean with this bad boy!</li>
            <li> Not the same as the ones I get at local stores. These &amp;#34;intercare&amp;#34; brushes were not like any of the other InterCare brushes I have been getting for the last two years. I compared the two and these seemed like a knock off. They came in Sonicare packaging but something seemed fake. The brush was a slightly different design and not as cleansing as before. It could be possible that Phillips changed them, but I don&#x27;t think so. Any retail store I go to they are like the originals I was getting before. These don&#x27;t seem authentic.</li>
            <li> Worked well and the best surprise was no surprise.</li>
            <li> Outstanding for dental care.</li>
            <li> Brush head leaves my teeth feeling like they have been thoroughly cleaned.</li>
            <li> These are good replacements for worn brush heads and I am very happy with them. Good price for three.</li>
            <li> These are very expensive brush heads but seem to get my teeth cleaner than the standard brush heads so I have to recommend them.  I&#x27;d like to seem them come down in price per head, but they do work and help keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> These worked well for my Philips sonicare toothbrush. I have the HX9140 and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> For as little as it takes to make these, these sonic brush heads are overly priced.  Next time I will search to find a generic non-brand name option.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, but I knew that when I bought it so otherwise its fine</li>
            <li> Super convenient to buy these via subscribe and save. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them anywhere else.</li>
