            <li>works good bought this for my tattoo artist</li>
            <li>so it might be a good time for me to tighten the twist.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed</li>
            <li>They get right into all of the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are just perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Nice price and worked well.</li>
            <li>Excellent tool for cleaning out ink from stainless steel tubes and grips.</li>
            <li>love the fact that they are on one ring they work good have not had any problems with them well made</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more of these soon because they are so good</li>
            <li>They bend easily, but are good.</li>
            <li>great for getting into the nooks &amp; crannies of tattoo equipment to get them clean &amp; help sterility, very important.</li>
            <li>but they are still good for fine cleanup jobs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just wanted to tell you all at amazon that i am very pleased with my purchase,&lt;br /&gt;the brushes work fine and will come in handy for me at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these because I thought they may be good to clean the barrel of a pistol/gun.  </li>
            <li>These are really good to have to clean your tubes.</li>
            <li>Buy these and clean your equipment good.</li>
            <li>Great for the price...only funny thing is, where is the bonus</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality</li>
            <li>I just use these on steel tubes or practice tubes because using steel tubes are health violation if used on more than one person</li>
            <li>Worked okay though.</li>
            <li>I prefer the disposables, but have kept the stainless steel for backup, and it&#x27;s just great to have these to make sure the backup tips are actually safe to use.  </li>
            <li>works for everything that we need it for plus so much more.</li>
            <li>much better then using pipe cleaners</li>
            <li>Pipe cleaners would probably work better than these though.</li>
            <li>I would forsure order more when needed.</li>
            <li>Better to get the ones from Harbor Freight.</li>
            <li>Does anything more need to be said?</li>
            <li>/&gt;i hope to do alot more shopping with you</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
            <li>that is why its ok</li>
            <li>The brushes are attached to a steel ring that helps it to stay safe.</li>
            <li>well i wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once though.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>it cleans his tattoo gun and the tattoo guns work better</li>
            <li>it works better</li>
            <li>and I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li>Pipe cleaners and fuzzy craft wire works better than these do.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for it to get here , only 3-5 MORE weeks to go!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good tool.</li>
            <li>but there good brushes to have when ur useing stainless tips and tubes</li>
            <li>The 5 brushes are a good kit size fits all my guns very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was good and fast</li>
            <li>this can clean out anything at all. :)</li>
            <li>i love using these to clean my tubes before switching colors.</li>
            <li>it made it easy for me</li>
            <li>and I got it very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a strong well built product.shipped to me</li>
            <li>The company itself was just fine, the items arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made item..</li>
            <li>forget how cheaply made these are geez</li>
            <li>These Brushes Are Light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping Was Free...</li>
            <li>have fun be safe</li>
            <li>great service and would totally recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li>I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
            <li>These are great for cleaning the rest of the airbrush though and certainly cheap enough to make it worth purchasing!  </li>
            <li>..even better than I wished for..i recommend it to any one who wants to start tattooing.it&#x27;s so easy to work with,i had no problem with it...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It Is a must when it comes to keeping your machines and accessories clean.</li>
            <li>They clean.</li>
            <li>You can never be too clean or sterile when it comes to your tattoo equipment -</li>
            <li>My husband is a tattoo artist and he uses these to clean some of his equipment.</li>
            <li>No way to use any of them to clean airbrush.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my tobacco pipes though.</li>
            <li>when I want to clean my tips they bend or brake</li>
            <li>Now I can enjoy my tattooing with much wider choice of inks as I am sure that there is a brush for even the toughest cleaning.</li>
            <li>Product came very quickly and I was impressed with the quality especially since the price was so low.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the price was right!</li>
            <li>those work fine, bought and extra set, more paper and more inks</li>
            <li>Such a great price for a much needed item!</li>
            <li>Not bad, overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tattoo Tube Cleaning Brushes had a great price and shipped Fast, The Company included A good sized catalog for other future purchases ( which means this was all advertising for them because I know it cost more to ship the catalog then what I paid for the brushes )</li>
            <li>but they are SUPER flemsy.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend them!</li>
            <li>I use them to clean all of my own personal Tattoo supplies.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>small, economical and absolutely the best item for a tattoo artist to own.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these for my son and he said he can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li>Someone else pointed out that the smallest brush is still too large to fit through the tip of an airbrush.</li>
            <li>Bought the brushes and even though there was a little hitch in getting them, they&#x27;re great tools to have when cleaning tattoo tips, tubes, ect.</li>
            <li>liked them I just wish there was a couple of smaller brushes</li>
            <li>But worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This cleaning brush does more than what is expected of it: it lasts, longer than most brushes out in the market.</li>
            <li>they well worth it.</li>
            <li>the smaller one is highly effective in removing ink even from the toughest bends.</li>
            <li>learn, do the right thing with tattoo equipment.</li>
            <li>since you clean stuff in water with soap, you would think these things would be made with stainless steel.</li>
            <li>it was cheap, decent &amp; nothing urgent.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great, small enough to fit in the stainless steel tips I have and make sure there&#x27;s no debris inside them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad shipping was fast for</li>
            <li>I suggest bending one of the large ones around to make a circular scrubber to get the large wells clean.</li>
            <li>The order came fast and they served their purpose exactly how I needed them to!</li>
            <li>Something every tattoo artist who uses autoclavable tubes and grips should have, also great for getting ink out of hard to reach areas on your machines if some gets on them despite the covers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using those tiny plastic throw away</li>
            <li>Most are the same size</li>
            <li>oh by the way i will be back to get more stuff</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>just research, study &amp; always practice actual safe procedures.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning my tips and rubes for my tattoo machine much easier!</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what they are advertised as.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a present, I think he must have enjoyed it, have heard no complaints</li>
            <li>This item is poor quality at any price very cheap need to find a better product to clean my tubes and tips</li>
            <li>Way too soft to clean a tattoo barrell.</li>
            <li>they work very well and have been holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>really good for getting in small spaces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest though I&#x27;ll probably stick to disposables, it&#x27;s just less to deal with.</li>
            <li>these are pretty standard and cheaply made but they do the job.</li>
            <li>Smaller then thought they would be and bend easy.</li>
            <li>another tip kit includes this as a free gift but for less than 2$ its fine.</li>
            <li>This product is ok but the bristles are not hard enough and it took forever to ship.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to any artist who is looking for a well built product fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li>For the money they are a handy little gadget to have around.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hoping they would be a little stiffer</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY THESE, YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED AND JILTED OF 2 DOLLARS.</li>
            <li>A&lt;br /&gt;There alright very flimzy</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and well made.</li>
            <li>The real thing is not as the picture shown.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These work very well for cleaning my tips and tubes.</li>
            <li>These cleaning tools work very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes are made of plastic brissles not metals so wear out fast.</li>
            <li>Not just for tattoo tubes, but you can use it for any item that really needs thorough brushing.  </li>
            <li>so i am unsure how to really rate this.</li>
            <li>Should have been a set of stainless steel brushes instead of the bogous plastic/nylon brushes they are.</li>
            <li>this product helped so much cleaning the tips for my fiances tattooing business.</li>
            <li>But these were 39 cents(!), shipped free all the way from Shen Zhen by Hong Kong post.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and perform exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li>Sure It Was Lost In The Ocean Due To Some Pirate Invasion</li>
            <li>They are too big to clean a .2mm tip however.</li>
            <li>the bristles fell out after the first use and even if they hadn&#x27;t they were not stiff enough to actually clean the tubes.</li>
            <li>These do the job, rinse clean easily, last forever, and stay nicely at hand with a small refrigerator magnet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new at the whole tattooing thing, and when I got my kit in, I was cleaning my stainless tips by soaking them in alcohol and twisting up a paper towel.</li>
            <li>There is supposed to be 5 metal brushes of various sizes, but I received four brushes of the same size of some kind of soft bristle of no use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad brushes but not what I asked for I thought they were all going to the different sizes I got 3 of them</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little cheap, but it gets the job done for what its worth.</li>
            <li>Luckily the cost was low, so who cares.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they make keeping my stainless tips clean that much easier.</li>
            <li>Could be a little more durable.</li>
            <li>but I mean for the price they&#x27;re pretty ok</li>
            <li>Bought these awhile ago and was dissapointed that all the cleaning brushes were the exact same size except for one.....</li>
            <li>Other than that the shipping was amazing, got them before some other stuff I had ordered from days sonner</li>
            <li>When I received this, the ring has 4 large sized brushes and one tiny brush with no graduating sizes in between.  </li>
            <li>so not only do I love these little brushes, I recommend them.  </li>
            <li>you now i can go back to using stainless steel tips instead of disposable.</li>
            <li>If you want to clean tiny stuff, try other sellers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and got them sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>just some crappy wire with some little cheaply put on plastic bristles and not even different sizes.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re all the same size except for one small one and they bend really easily</li>
            <li>and it was only 2 bucks for some little brushes to clean my tubes.  </li>
            <li>Only the small brush will fit into my liner tube.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using disposables and with the tattoo cleaning brushes I started using the sturdy tattoo supplies for my personal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many weeks and no brushes, and according to other reviews (I didn&#x27;t read them as I usually do)</li>
            <li>And at the price, there is no excuse!</li>
            <li>The Sounds Of The Oceans High Winds And Rough Waters...</li>
            <li>They are small enough to get into the tiny spaces you really want to get in (e.g. the gunk-collecting crevices in a Ninja blender motor, a glass pipe, a squeeze dropper) and the brush feels sturdy enough, but the little metal handles bend really easily, so you&#x27;re probably not going to be scrubbing anything to a squeaky cleanness.</li>
            <li>but brushes could be a little more rough other than that it worked</li>
            <li>i love these cleaning brushes they work so well and get all the little places that ink usually gets caught in abd dries.  </li>

            <li> so it might be a good time for me to tighten the twist.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed</li>
            <li> They get right into all of the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are just perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Nice price and worked well.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for cleaning out ink from stainless steel tubes and grips.</li>
            <li> love the fact that they are on one ring they work good have not had any problems with them well made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more of these soon because they are so good</li>
            <li> They bend easily, but are good.</li>
            <li> great for getting into the nooks &amp; crannies of tattoo equipment to get them clean &amp; help sterility, very important.</li>
            <li> but they are still good for fine cleanup jobs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i just wanted to tell you all at amazon that i am very pleased with my purchase,&lt;br /&gt;the brushes work fine and will come in handy for me at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got these because I thought they may be good to clean the barrel of a pistol/gun.  </li>
            <li> These are really good to have to clean your tubes.</li>
            <li> Buy these and clean your equipment good.</li>
            <li> Great for the price...only funny thing is, where is the bonus</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality</li>
            <li> I just use these on steel tubes or practice tubes because using steel tubes are health violation if used on more than one person</li>
            <li> Worked okay though.</li>
            <li> I prefer the disposables, but have kept the stainless steel for backup, and it&#x27;s just great to have these to make sure the backup tips are actually safe to use.  </li>
            <li> works for everything that we need it for plus so much more.</li>
            <li> much better then using pipe cleaners</li>
            <li> Pipe cleaners would probably work better than these though.</li>
            <li> I would forsure order more when needed.</li>
            <li> Better to get the ones from Harbor Freight.</li>
            <li> Does anything more need to be said?</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hope to do alot more shopping with you</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
            <li> that is why its ok</li>
            <li> The brushes are attached to a steel ring that helps it to stay safe.</li>
            <li> well i wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once though.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> it cleans his tattoo gun and the tattoo guns work better</li>
            <li> it works better</li>
            <li> and I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> Pipe cleaners and fuzzy craft wire works better than these do.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for it to get here , only 3-5 MORE weeks to go!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good tool.</li>
            <li> but there good brushes to have when ur useing stainless tips and tubes</li>
            <li> The 5 brushes are a good kit size fits all my guns very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was good and fast</li>
            <li> this can clean out anything at all. :)</li>
            <li> i love using these to clean my tubes before switching colors.</li>
            <li> it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> and I got it very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a strong well built product.shipped to me</li>
            <li> The company itself was just fine, the items arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made item..</li>
            <li> forget how cheaply made these are geez</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Light</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping Was Free...</li>
            <li> have fun be safe</li>
            <li> great service and would totally recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning the rest of the airbrush though and certainly cheap enough to make it worth purchasing!  </li>
            <li> ..even better than I wished for..i recommend it to any one who wants to start tattooing.it&#x27;s so easy to work with,i had no problem with it...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It Is a must when it comes to keeping your machines and accessories clean.</li>
            <li> They clean.</li>
            <li> You can never be too clean or sterile when it comes to your tattoo equipment -</li>
            <li> My husband is a tattoo artist and he uses these to clean some of his equipment.</li>
            <li> No way to use any of them to clean airbrush.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my tobacco pipes though.</li>
            <li> when I want to clean my tips they bend or brake</li>
            <li> Now I can enjoy my tattooing with much wider choice of inks as I am sure that there is a brush for even the toughest cleaning.</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly and I was impressed with the quality especially since the price was so low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the price was right!</li>
            <li> those work fine, bought and extra set, more paper and more inks</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a much needed item!</li>
            <li> Not bad, overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Tattoo Tube Cleaning Brushes had a great price and shipped Fast, The Company included A good sized catalog for other future purchases ( which means this was all advertising for them because I know it cost more to ship the catalog then what I paid for the brushes )</li>
            <li> but they are SUPER flemsy.</li>
            <li> I very much recommend them!</li>
            <li> I use them to clean all of my own personal Tattoo supplies.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> small, economical and absolutely the best item for a tattoo artist to own.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these for my son and he said he can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li> Someone else pointed out that the smallest brush is still too large to fit through the tip of an airbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought the brushes and even though there was a little hitch in getting them, they&#x27;re great tools to have when cleaning tattoo tips, tubes, ect.</li>
            <li> liked them I just wish there was a couple of smaller brushes</li>
            <li> But worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This cleaning brush does more than what is expected of it: it lasts, longer than most brushes out in the market.</li>
            <li> they well worth it.</li>
            <li> the smaller one is highly effective in removing ink even from the toughest bends.</li>
            <li> learn, do the right thing with tattoo equipment.</li>
            <li> since you clean stuff in water with soap, you would think these things would be made with stainless steel.</li>
            <li> it was cheap, decent &amp; nothing urgent.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, small enough to fit in the stainless steel tips I have and make sure there&#x27;s no debris inside them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad shipping was fast for</li>
            <li> I suggest bending one of the large ones around to make a circular scrubber to get the large wells clean.</li>
            <li> The order came fast and they served their purpose exactly how I needed them to!</li>
            <li> Something every tattoo artist who uses autoclavable tubes and grips should have, also great for getting ink out of hard to reach areas on your machines if some gets on them despite the covers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off using those tiny plastic throw away</li>
            <li> Most are the same size</li>
            <li> oh by the way i will be back to get more stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> just research, study &amp; always practice actual safe procedures.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning my tips and rubes for my tattoo machine much easier!</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what they are advertised as.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a present, I think he must have enjoyed it, have heard no complaints</li>
            <li> This item is poor quality at any price very cheap need to find a better product to clean my tubes and tips</li>
            <li> Way too soft to clean a tattoo barrell.</li>
            <li> they work very well and have been holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> really good for getting in small spaces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest though I&#x27;ll probably stick to disposables, it&#x27;s just less to deal with.</li>
            <li> these are pretty standard and cheaply made but they do the job.</li>
            <li> Smaller then thought they would be and bend easy.</li>
            <li> another tip kit includes this as a free gift but for less than 2$ its fine.</li>
            <li> This product is ok but the bristles are not hard enough and it took forever to ship.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to any artist who is looking for a well built product fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li> For the money they are a handy little gadget to have around.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hoping they would be a little stiffer</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE, YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED AND JILTED OF 2 DOLLARS.</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;There alright very flimzy</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and well made.</li>
            <li> The real thing is not as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These work very well for cleaning my tips and tubes.</li>
            <li> These cleaning tools work very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are made of plastic brissles not metals so wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Not just for tattoo tubes, but you can use it for any item that really needs thorough brushing.  </li>
            <li> so i am unsure how to really rate this.</li>
            <li> Should have been a set of stainless steel brushes instead of the bogous plastic/nylon brushes they are.</li>
            <li> this product helped so much cleaning the tips for my fiances tattooing business.</li>
            <li> But these were 39 cents(!), shipped free all the way from Shen Zhen by Hong Kong post.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and perform exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li> Sure It Was Lost In The Ocean Due To Some Pirate Invasion</li>
            <li> They are too big to clean a .2mm tip however.</li>
            <li> the bristles fell out after the first use and even if they hadn&#x27;t they were not stiff enough to actually clean the tubes.</li>
            <li> These do the job, rinse clean easily, last forever, and stay nicely at hand with a small refrigerator magnet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new at the whole tattooing thing, and when I got my kit in, I was cleaning my stainless tips by soaking them in alcohol and twisting up a paper towel.</li>
            <li> There is supposed to be 5 metal brushes of various sizes, but I received four brushes of the same size of some kind of soft bristle of no use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bad brushes but not what I asked for I thought they were all going to the different sizes I got 3 of them</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little cheap, but it gets the job done for what its worth.</li>
            <li> Luckily the cost was low, so who cares.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they make keeping my stainless tips clean that much easier.</li>
            <li> Could be a little more durable.</li>
            <li> but I mean for the price they&#x27;re pretty ok</li>
            <li> Bought these awhile ago and was dissapointed that all the cleaning brushes were the exact same size except for one.....</li>
            <li> Other than that the shipping was amazing, got them before some other stuff I had ordered from days sonner</li>
            <li> When I received this, the ring has 4 large sized brushes and one tiny brush with no graduating sizes in between.  </li>
            <li> so not only do I love these little brushes, I recommend them.  </li>
            <li> you now i can go back to using stainless steel tips instead of disposable.</li>
            <li> If you want to clean tiny stuff, try other sellers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and got them sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> just some crappy wire with some little cheaply put on plastic bristles and not even different sizes.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all the same size except for one small one and they bend really easily</li>
            <li> and it was only 2 bucks for some little brushes to clean my tubes.  </li>
            <li> Only the small brush will fit into my liner tube.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using disposables and with the tattoo cleaning brushes I started using the sturdy tattoo supplies for my personal use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many weeks and no brushes, and according to other reviews (I didn&#x27;t read them as I usually do)</li>
            <li> And at the price, there is no excuse!</li>
            <li> The Sounds Of The Oceans High Winds And Rough Waters...</li>
            <li> They are small enough to get into the tiny spaces you really want to get in (e.g. the gunk-collecting crevices in a Ninja blender motor, a glass pipe, a squeeze dropper) and the brush feels sturdy enough, but the little metal handles bend really easily, so you&#x27;re probably not going to be scrubbing anything to a squeaky cleanness.</li>
            <li> but brushes could be a little more rough other than that it worked</li>
            <li> i love these cleaning brushes they work so well and get all the little places that ink usually gets caught in abd dries.  </li>
            <li> Great little brushes that can get into places otherwise would be very difficult.</li>
            <li> It cleans it but they are not as big or as long</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little soft for my taste but still seem to do the job</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves started leaving bits of themselves behind and were not very helpful for me trying to clean something.</li>
            <li> Every time I use them the fall apart and get little black hairs everywhere, also they don&#x27;t get small enough to clean my 3R tip</li>
            <li> So as long as it comes on or before the date I was told</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get the items and are much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I ordered these bushes in good faith, but either they are lost or the shipper just doesn&#x27;t give a crap about their business.</li>
            <li> It turns out that these brushes are tiny in size, about the size of a half of pencil (my mistake, no big deal)!  </li>
            <li> they arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong buying these brushes in bulk to clean all of your Tattoo accessories.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t made to last forever, these last about 1 month with everyday use....</li>
            <li> all the same diameter besides one little one</li>
            <li> I little smaller than I though they would be , but still works well for what I got them for.</li>
            <li> 5 big brushes and 1 little brush</li>
            <li> hmmmmm I have also been finding tubes and grips that are not stainless or aluminum.</li>
            <li> And even with drying them off after every use it was only a few weeks before it began to rust.</li>
            <li> Still usable, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> , I got four brushes from the same size and one small.</li>
            <li> It arrived as was expected without any problems!</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewers described here.</li>
            <li> All the other stuff I use are throw always.</li>
            <li> 4 of them are way too big and the other one is way too small, not what advertised.</li>
            <li> they were the same size and 1 small</li>
            <li> i got my brushes today and four of them are the same they are the biggest brush out of five and one small also a little dameged.</li>
            <li> It is actually 4 larger brushes, and one very very VERY small one.</li>
            <li> Less Than A Buck Fifty And</li>
            <li> little bothered cuz i did not get all five size brushes.</li>
            <li> The one I got has 5 big brushes of the same size and 1 small brush, WTF?</li>
            <li> I Tattoo almost Everyday</li>
            <li> None Of The Mail Seamen Could Hear The Paper Thin Envelope Hit The Breakers Outside Of The Ship</li>
            <li> Buy a few they do wear out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.nothing like whats in the picture</li>
            <li> Total false advertising.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for machine tube cleaning or any other hard to get to cleaning assignment.</li>
            <li> At least was less than 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> were its a hard spot to get into.</li>
            <li> i can scrub as hard as i want and they stay intact.</li>
            <li> this is a common occurance.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re flimsy, and bend horribly when trying to clean my tattoo gun.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, save your money and buy pipe cleaners</li>
            <li> these are extremely small, im kinda disappointed at the size and how long it took to get these&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> On That Unfortunate Evening At Sea.</li>
            <li> It rarely failed on me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Took way too long to get the items and are much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Nice price and worked well. You will be waiting a while for these but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> They were a gift and he was happy.</li>
            <li> These are as described but are ALOT tinier but for a reason, I&#x27;m sure!! But they are as described!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> get what you pay for.. its a dollar and some change.. but they are SUPER flemsy.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality, I got four brushes from the same size and one small. At least was less than 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> liked them I just wish there was a couple of smaller brushes</li>
            <li> If there was an option for no Stars I would have picked that. Terrible but I guess you get what you pay for. DO NOT BUY THESE, YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED AND JILTED OF 2 DOLLARS.</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;There alright very flimzy</li>
            <li> i love these cleaning brushes they work so well and get all the little places that ink usually gets caught in abd dries.  thatk you now i can go back to using stainless steel tips instead of disposable.</li>
            <li> What can I say, It&#x27;s a set of cleaning brushes.... They are what they are :D They work great; ya know? They shipped faster then the shipping said Good Seller and Good Product:D If you need It buy it. It Is a must when it comes to keeping your machines and accessories clean.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not quite the assortment of sizes shown in picture but they are still good for fine cleanup jobs. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> small, economical and absolutely the best item for a tattoo artist to own.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these for my son and he said he can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li> When purchasing these, I thought they were steel brush tips but I was wrong. They are all the same size though which is not what was advertised. not going to use these for anything but throwing them away.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with cleaning my airbrush. Someone else pointed out that the smallest brush is still too large to fit through the tip of an airbrush. These are great for cleaning the rest of the airbrush though and certainly cheap enough to make it worth purchasing!  Note: For cleaning the tip of my Badger 155 Anthem airbrush I purchased [[ASIN:B005MFKTZ4 DenTek Slim Brush Interdental Brush, 32 ea]] and they work great for that part. They are too big to clean a .2mm tip however.</li>
            <li> great for getting into the nooks &amp; crannies of tattoo equipment to get them clean &amp; help sterility, very important. arrived when stated</li>
            <li> mu dad loves the for cleaning his tattoo gun</li>
            <li> I got these because I thought they may be good to clean the barrel of a pistol/gun.  It turns out that these brushes are tiny in size, about the size of a half of pencil (my mistake, no big deal)!  And as others have said, they are are all the same diameter, which is different than the description and photo (thus three stars).  Luckily the cost was low, so who cares.</li>
            <li> Great for the price...only funny thing is, where is the bonus so call 5-tattoo needles they say come with it? Other than that the shipping was amazing, got them before some other stuff I had ordered from days sonner then this order.</li>
            <li> i got my brushes today and four of them are the same they are the biggest brush out of five and one small also a little dameged. little bothered cuz i did not get all five size brushes.</li>
            <li> They work. They scrub. They clean. Good.</li>
            <li> It cleans it but they are not as big or as long</li>
            <li> These are really good to have to clean your tubes.</li>
            <li> i orders the tattoo brushes on october 3 and  today is october 16 and i still havent recived them.. i tried emailing them andh the replyed asking me 2 varify my adress which i did and i havent got a responce yet and they dont give tracking numbers so thier is no telling what happpend</li>
            <li> The company itself was just fine, the items arrived on time.  As others have stated, the picture is incorrect, there is only one bag of brushes and they&#x27;re all the same size.  However I knew this buying it and it was only 2 bucks for some little brushes to clean my tubes.  Not bad, overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest though I&#x27;ll probably stick to disposables, it&#x27;s just less to deal with.</li>
            <li> These are flimsy. Not exactly what I expected. I also should not have ordered them from China. It took over one month to get these in the mail. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good to have and a must need set of brushes</li>
            <li> Now this is a must have tool in fact you should buy a pair just incase you need to replace one</li>
            <li> I just use these on steel tubes or practice tubes because using steel tubes are health violation if used on more than one person</li>
            <li> For the money they are a handy little gadget to have around.Could be a little more durable.But still a good buy.</li>
            <li> they do not look like the picture there all the same diameter besides one little one but there good brushes to have when ur useing stainless tips and tubes</li>
            <li> I ordered these bushes in good faith, but either they are lost or the shipper just doesn&#x27;t give a crap about their business. It&#x27;s been many weeks and no brushes, and according to other reviews (I didn&#x27;t read them as I usually do) this is a common occurance. My advice, STAY AWAY from anything this joker is offering!</li>
            <li> The picture shows 6 brushes of different sizes. The one I got has 5 big brushes of the same size and 1 small brush, WTF? Only the small brush will fit into my liner tube. Absolutely useless. I&#x27;m better off using those tiny plastic throw away brushes found at the dental hygiene isle in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Every time I use them the fall apart and get little black hairs everywhere, also they don&#x27;t get small enough to clean my 3R tip</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for cleaning out ink from stainless steel tubes and grips. Something every tattoo artist who uses autoclavable tubes and grips should have, also great for getting ink out of hard to reach areas on your machines if some gets on them despite the covers.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made item.. But you get what you pay for sometimes, and this is one of those things. Worked okay though. Wont be buying these again tho.</li>
            <li> since you clean stuff in water with soap, you would think these things would be made with stainless steel. But they rust! Which means you risk putting rust into a customers blood. hmmmmm I have also been finding tubes and grips that are not stainless or aluminum. dahhhhhhh</li>
            <li> these are extremely small, im kinda disappointed at the size and how long it took to get these&lt;br /&gt;cant forget how cheaply made these are geez they look like someone took and hacked off the bristles&lt;br /&gt; i suppose you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Imean, they have been doing the hob as advertised</li>
            <li> love the fact that they are on one ring they work good have not had any problems with them well made</li>
            <li> They are great and they get the job Done! I use them for my tattoo tubes and also to get into clip cord holes were its a hard spot to get into.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, small enough to fit in the stainless steel tips I have and make sure there&#x27;s no debris inside them.  In combination with the ultrasonic - this is just a great way to prep the tips for sterilization and reuse.  I prefer the disposables, but have kept the stainless steel for backup, and it&#x27;s just great to have these to make sure the backup tips are actually safe to use.  You can never be too clean or sterile when it comes to your tattoo equipment - so not only do I love these little brushes, I recommend them.  And at the price, there is no excuse!</li>
            <li> It was in great condition! It arrived as was expected without any problems! I very much recommend them! I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> works for everything that we need it for plus so much more. this can clean out anything at all. :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and got them sooner than I expected. Very inexpensive and well made. Cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> i love using these to clean my tubes before switching colors. they work very well and have been holding up pretty well. i can scrub as hard as i want and they stay intact. much better then using pipe cleaners</li>
            <li> This is a strong well built product.shipped to me fast.price was personable.I strongly recommend this product to any artist who is looking for a well built product fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re junk. But you get what you paid for I suppose. Pipe cleaners would probably work better than these though. They&#x27;re flimsy, and bend horribly when trying to clean my tattoo gun. And even with drying them off after every use it was only a few weeks before it began to rust. Seriously though, save your money and buy pipe cleaners</li>
            <li> thank you  great product with timely shipping</li>
            <li> The Tattoo Tube Cleaning Brushes had a great price and shipped Fast, The Company included A good sized catalog for other future purchases ( which means this was all advertising for them because I know it cost more to ship the catalog then what I paid for the brushes )</li>
            <li> Most are the same size but there cheep they kind of work there not the best but for the price it&#x27;s not bad shipping was fast for were they came from</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they would be, at all. Way too soft to clean a tattoo barrell.</li>
            <li> My husband is a tattoo artist and he uses these to clean some of his equipment. really good for getting in small spaces.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewers described here. This seller mislead to sell product not pictures shown here. The real thing is not as the picture shown. Four of them are the same  biggest size. Only one is mid size. No way to use any of them to clean airbrush. If you want to clean tiny stuff, try other sellers.</li>
            <li> these are pretty standard and cheaply made but they do the job. will order again if and when the time comes</li>
            <li> hmmmmmm / brushes how do you comment on these...lol</li>
            <li> its good to have indeed i cant say i have had a problem with this. Well done... oh by the way i will be back to get more stuff</li>
            <li> these brushes are solid and work well for their purpose. one brush was bent in the package but no big deal i guess. a good buy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain since I don&#x27;t use them for their intended purpose. but I would like to find a set with stiffer brushes</li>
            <li> they work great, perfect</li>
            <li> they are alright but not really enough bristles</li>
            <li> Very good Item , These are as Tattoo tube cleaning brushes,and Airbrush cleaning brushes as well These aren&#x27;t made to last forever, these last about 1 month with everyday use.... I Tattoo almost Everyday and I only order replacements 1 month or so at the under $5 its cheaper then driving to a local supply shop to buy them.</li>
            <li> Bought these awhile ago and was dissapointed that all the cleaning brushes were the exact same size except for one.....</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. I little smaller than I though they would be , but still works well for what I got them for. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea product. The bristles are a little cheap, but it gets the job done for what its worth.</li>
            <li> This was featured as different size brushes. It is actually 4 larger brushes, and one very very VERY small one. Still usable, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This item is very good and well used. The 5 brushes are a good kit size fits all my guns very well. I would forsure order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I Never Received Them,It&#x27;s Been Since August.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Sure It Was Lost In The Ocean Due To Some Pirate Invasion Where My Parcel Was Accidently Kicked Off The Mail Boat During One Of The 17 Different Scuffles That Was Going On Through All The Cannonball Explosions And Dagger Fights On That Unfortunate Evening At Sea.These Brushes Are Light And Tiny!Between The Sounds Of The Oceans High Winds And Rough Waters...None Of The Mail Seamen Could Hear The Paper Thin Envelope Hit The Breakers Outside Of The Ship Anyways If There Had Not Of Been A Pirate Attack To Begin With.&lt;br /&gt;Since It Was Less Than A Buck Fifty And&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Was Free...I Give It Five Stars! : )&lt;br /&gt;Rest In Peace USPS S.S.&lt;br /&gt;We Will Miss You!&lt;br /&gt;...And My Tattoo Tube&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Brushes : (</li>
            <li> The hair on these things fell out before I even got them. Was ALL in the bag with just sprigs left on the handle. Better to get the ones from Harbor Freight. Not to mention it took weeks to get to me.</li>
            <li> the pictures show various sized tube cleaners. you get 5 &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and 1 &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;.  The brushes themselves started leaving bits of themselves behind and were not very helpful for me trying to clean something.</li>
            <li> Great cleaners for alot of things not just for the tattoo machine. Comes in very handy and the ruff brushes assures cleaness.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong buying these brushes in bulk to clean all of your Tattoo accessories. I use them to clean all of my own personal Tattoo supplies. All the other stuff I use are throw always. But for me I prefer these brushes. They get right into all of the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a much needed item! The order came fast and they served their purpose exactly how I needed them to! Great buy!</li>
            <li> They are brushes.. they scrub things. hehe These work very well for cleaning my tips and tubes. I suggest bending one of the large ones around to make a circular scrubber to get the large wells clean.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
            <li> The brissels are all falling off and it doesnt come with a brush for your 7 liners and under. .</li>
            <li> Good buy if you don&#x27;t mind waiting literally a f*#@%¿¢ year for it to show up.</li>
            <li> Pretty good tool. I use it to clean my tobacco pipes though.</li>
            <li> Purchased for cleaning carburetor passageways. Works. Does anything more need to be said?</li>
            <li> hello, i resently purchased the tattoo tube cleaning brushes and&lt;br /&gt;i just wanted to tell you all at amazon that i am very pleased with my purchase,&lt;br /&gt;the brushes work fine and will come in handy for me at the time.&lt;br /&gt;i hope to do alot more shopping with you, you all have the best products. thank you</li>
            <li> A must have for tube cleaning. Buy a few they do wear out. But worth every penny. Buy these and clean your equipment good.</li>
            <li> the bristles fell out after the first use and even if they hadn&#x27;t they were not stiff enough to actually clean the tubes.</li>
            <li> Great..even better than I wished for..i recommend it to any one who wants to start tattooing.it&#x27;s so easy to work with,i had no problem with it...</li>
            <li> Great little brushes that can get into places otherwise would be very difficult. The bristles are a little soft for my taste but still seem to do the job OK. I would recommend for machine tube cleaning or any other hard to get to cleaning assignment. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> it was great........ ....... ....... ....... ....... ........ ...... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . . ..</li>
            <li> Total false advertising. It is not what is shown. There is supposed to be 5 metal brushes of various sizes, but I received four brushes of the same size of some kind of soft bristle of no use. Rip off!</li>
            <li> This cleaning brush does more than what is expected of it: it lasts, longer than most brushes out in the market. It rarely failed on me.</li>
            <li> They bend easily, but are good.</li>
            <li> These cleaning tools work very well. I was kind of hoping they would be a little stiffer but they do get the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good took forever to get here though.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all the same size except for one small one and they bend really easily but I mean for the price they&#x27;re pretty ok</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li> title says it all, these are very very very low quality. would not reccomend to anyone at all. do not buy</li>
            <li> Smaller then thought they would be and bend easy.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but they work great sturdy design good quality all around good</li>
            <li> 5 big brushes and 1 little brush I hate it cus when I want to clean my tips they bend or brake it&#x27;s pretty s***y but alright price</li>
            <li> All brushes came the same size  dispite the fact that the picture shows several sizes. Seeing as. I use disposable tips I&#x27;m OK with it. Brushes are made of plastic brissles not metals so wear out fast. Shipping was good and fast</li>
            <li> Not just for tattoo tubes, but you can use it for any item that really needs thorough brushing.  I&#x27;ll be getting more of these soon because they are so good I don&#x27;t every want to run out.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to get into the tiny spaces you really want to get in (e.g. the gunk-collecting crevices in a Ninja blender motor, a glass pipe, a squeeze dropper) and the brush feels sturdy enough, but the little metal handles bend really easily, so you&#x27;re probably not going to be scrubbing anything to a squeaky cleanness. These are a step or two above disposable arts and crafts fuzzy pipe cleaners. Also, they took forever to arrive, even for international purchases. I had almost forgotten I&#x27;d ordered them by the time they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the price was right!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for it to get here , only 3-5 MORE weeks to go!!! Kinda lame but just remember we choose to shop here. So as long as it comes on or before the date I was told and I get everything that was advertised ill change this</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> not the greatest quality , maybe get 4 or 5 cleanings with them but for the money....they well worth it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for someone else so i am unsure how to really rate this. that is why its ok</li>
            <li> This item is poor quality at any price very cheap need to find a better product to clean my tubes and tips</li>
            <li> So far I have been using disposables and with the tattoo cleaning brushes I started using the sturdy tattoo supplies for my personal use. All the five brushes are great. They are of varied sizes and the smaller one is highly effective in removing ink even from the toughest bends. Now I can enjoy my tattooing with much wider choice of inks as I am sure that there is a brush for even the toughest cleaning. The brushes are attached to a steel ring that helps it to stay safe. Once I finish cleaning I hang the brush onto the ring so that I can save searching for the brushes.</li>
            <li> works well. took a while but het it was cheap, decent &amp; nothing urgent. another tip kit includes this as a free gift but for less than 2$ its fine. just research, study &amp; always practice actual safe procedures. kids stay away, adults dont be.kids. learn, do the right thing with tattoo equipment. regardless of product or equipment quality its human bodirs that need to be respected, self or others alike. have fun be safe</li>
            <li> These are just perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my bestie and he said the brushes are perfect for cleaning the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good sizes, must have!</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly and I was impressed with the quality especially since the price was so low. It was a great deal!</li>
            <li> works good bought this for my tattoo artist</li>
            <li> works well but brushes could be a little more rough other than that it worked well i wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once though.</li>
            <li> Should have been a set of stainless steel brushes instead of the bogous plastic/nylon brushes they are. Buy the stainlees ones and not these.</li>
            <li> this product helped so much cleaning the tips for my fiances tattooing business. before i was using pipe cleaners and a wire brush. these get into every crevace. thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning thank you</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase and delivrry time</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning my tips and rubes for my tattoo machine much easier!</li>
            <li> Bought the brushes and even though there was a little hitch in getting them, they&#x27;re great tools to have when cleaning tattoo tips, tubes, ect. I intend to order from this seller again. On several different occasions.</li>
            <li> THE BEST VALUE I&#x27;VE FOUND IN BRUSHES, I USE THEM FREQUENTLEY FOR CLEANING AIRBRUSHES/ COLOR CUPS, TATTOO EQUIPMENT, I INTEND TO ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> 4 of them are way too big and the other one is way too small, not what advertised.</li>
            <li> those work fine, bought and extra set, more paper and more inks</li>
            <li> When I received this, the ring has 4 large sized brushes and one tiny brush with no graduating sizes in between.  The bristles are shedding even before I&#x27;ve used them.  Guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I&#x27;m still new at the whole tattooing thing, and when I got my kit in, I was cleaning my stainless tips by soaking them in alcohol and twisting up a paper towel. (Not recommeded.) I&#x27;m still learning things along the way, but getting the brushes is a tidbit that I&#x27;m very happy to have come across. My only issue is that my brushes are a 5 count - not the six shown in the pitcure - 4 of which are all the same size. The shortest-clipped brush is already losing its cropped bristles at the tip so it might be a good time for me to tighten the twist. Other than that, they make keeping my stainless tips clean that much easier.</li>
            <li> it cleans his tattoo gun and the tattoo guns work better and they are not over heated it works better</li>
            <li> Kinda tore up on me . the bristles keep coming out for no reason</li>
            <li> Everything that was recieved as described and I got it very quickly. The product was just what I wanted to purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, they work great! they arrived earlier than expected! great service and would totally recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li> i love it thx its perfect</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.nothing like whats in the picture just some crappy wire with some little cheaply put on plastic bristles and not even different sizes.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove coffee build-up on my coffee grinder. These do the job, rinse clean easily, last forever, and stay nicely at hand with a small refrigerator magnet. None of that is a big deal, and this would get three stars if it cost three bucks. But these were 39 cents(!), shipped free all the way from Shen Zhen by Hong Kong post.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bad brushes but not what I asked for I thought they were all going to the different sizes I got 3 of them they were the same size and 1 small</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what they are advertised as.  Simple cleaning brushes.  Easy to use and perform exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li> It took longer to get these than it said it would and they were falling apart when I opened the package. I am not happy with this and I will not be ordering any more. Pipe cleaners and fuzzy craft wire works better than these do.</li>
            <li> Bought as a present, I think he must have enjoyed it, have heard no complaints</li>
            <li> This product is ok but the bristles are not hard enough and it took forever to ship.</li>
