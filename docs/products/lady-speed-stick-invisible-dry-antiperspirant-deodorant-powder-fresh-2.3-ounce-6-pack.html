            <li> It does not leave a white film on your clothes and it goes on dry and clear.  </li>
            <li> will certainly take care of any heavy sweating or odor problems you may have!</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts a long time and it keeps you dry and</li>
            <li> Fresh\\&quot; invisible dry in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> The actual product is dark purple and has a 24-hour protection label.  </li>
            <li> If I had wanted the dark purple product, I could have purchased it at my local grocery.  </li>
            <li> disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER had this problem with any other brand of deodorant.</li>
            <li> i used lady speed stick for over 3 years now and it never let me down at any situation, i recommended it for any one hesitant to buy it ...</li>
            <li> I had issues with my deodorant when I was pregnant with my 2nd child, and became very frustrated that I could no longer use my regular brand (Dove), and I had trouble finding anything that would keep me as dry as Dove had done in the past.  </li>
            <li> No complaints from others so, far...know what I mean?</li>
            <li> Also it washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue behind.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received the package and found that I had 6 different scents...</li>
            <li> Makes you miserable all day long and allows you to sweat profusely.</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing.</li>

            <li> I like the soft powder scent for deodorant, and it keeps me nice and dry-but it&#x27;s very subtle. No complaints from others so, far...know what I mean?</li>
            <li> This is by far my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant.  She loves the powder scent and has used it for years.  It does not leave a white film on your clothes and it goes on dry and clear.  The fragrance lasts a long time and it keeps you dry and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is pretty picky and if she likes it as much as she says then I am sure you will like it also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this online because I am no longer able to find the original powder scent in the stores. I was very disappointed when I received the package and found that I had 6 different scents...Freesia, Shower Fresh, Orchard, and a few others...  It was not what I wanted at all!! Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> The product I received was different than the photo. However, it is the same as what I am currently using so it worked out well for me. I received the \\&quot;dare to wear black\\&quot; invisible dry, which I like much better. It was well packaged.</li>
            <li> The photo shows light purple packaging.  The actual product is dark purple and has a 24-hour protection label.  If I had wanted the dark purple product, I could have purchased it at my local grocery.  I ordered the light purple and expected to get that.  Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li> This was always one of my favorite products but sadly I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s becoming less effective. I do switch my deodorants up but after coming back to this one and sweating through by midday, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> the shipment more quickly than i hoped. The product package good quality. all was good.</li>
            <li> I am loving this brand at the moment. Lady Speed stick is superior in its ability to keep my pits dry and this formula does last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> the label says its an antiperspirant but it doesn&#x27;t work well as one at all. I was looking for the old powder fresh antiperspirant, in the lilac colored container, love that product. Do not like this one at all, and I bought a six pack.  disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> Using this product ruined my blouse. I used this product once and it made the colors of my blouse &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; and run together under the arms. I contacted Cogate-Palmolive and they refuse to take responsibility, saying it was my perspiration and the heat from the washer and/or dryer. That&#x27;s ridiculous. I&#x27;ve NEVER had this problem with any other brand of deodorant. Additionally, the blouse was clean when I put it on and at the end of the day, BEFORE being laundered, the colors had run. My blouse is now ruined.</li>
            <li> I have had strong b.o. and sweat issues since I was a young teen and this is one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve used that controls both! I do still notice some odor but I think that&#x27;s probably my problem rather than the deodorant. Also it washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue behind. Plus the price is right. This combined with certain dri will certainly take care of any heavy sweating or odor problems you may have!</li>
            <li> Gosh - how pregnancy changes things!!  I had issues with my deodorant when I was pregnant with my 2nd child, and became very frustrated that I could no longer use my regular brand (Dove), and I had trouble finding anything that would keep me as dry as Dove had done in the past.  I had a coupon for Speed Stick and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It worked wonders!!  I now only buy the powder fresh Speed Stick - it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a reaction and that keeps me fresh and dry on a daily basis.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-perspirant stick I have ever used and the company went and changed it!  You can&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; invisible dry in the store anymore. I was so upset with  the changed formula that I got in the store;I sent it back to the company along with my  complaints. This one smells wonderful, keeps you dry and never allows odor to take over.  My husband even uses it from time to time as it is more effective than what he uses.  Once again, Amazon saved me!  I bought as much as I could to last for years because I&#x27;m  affraid I won&#x27;t be able to get it anymore. The stick that is for sale in the stores is   called \\&quot;Powder Burst\\&quot; and smells awful. Don&#x27;t be fooled, it smells like an old man&#x27;s after  shave. Makes you miserable all day long and allows you to sweat profusely.</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for (in Germany) loves this deodorant.  She says it is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> i used lady speed stick for over 3 years now and it never let me down at any situation, i recommended it for any one hesitant to buy it ...</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing. Out of the 6 pcs that I have ordered for this particular item, 3 pcs has already expired (01/2015) and 2 pcs are nearly expiring (05/2015). Please refer to the attached picture. I am from Philippines and I had this brought home this week since my brother Jon is flying in to Manila. Kindly provide your recommendation on how this will be replaced? Btw, the expiry date of the 6th stick will expire on 10/2015. One star since I was required to put a rating.</li>
