            <li>This is truly awesome</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>I have VERY fine hair and this product is great!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product for my fine hair!</li>
            <li>so I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>As a regular kerastase user I must say this is the best masque since masquintence, a decade ago!!</li>
            <li>Love this product and love this price</li>
            <li>Good and  on right time.</li>
            <li>it is more strong</li>
            <li>I made sure to have some of my salon purchased Kerastase available in order to compare the two products once the on-line purchase arrived.</li>
            <li>and I love that it does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li>but I feel this product really helps my hair look healthier and with more body.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Does not wait it down, feels great.  </li>
            <li>Absolute best product for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for fine hair ladies!</li>
            <li>Any time I have purchased a Kerastase mask, this cover has been over the product as a seal before the first use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter to me as much as the savings (over $15)</li>
            <li>Hmmmmm... not so much.</li>
            <li>Even if you can&#x27;t afford all Ketastase products,this is the one you want if you have thinner, or older, hair.</li>
            <li>This does not feel or smell like the conditioner of the exact same brand and line that I buy in the store.</li>
            <li>I think this is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten that actually delivers on what it promises...</li>
            <li>Maybe an old version??</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair soft and shiny, I still use other styling products</li>

            <li> the only thing &#x27;wrong&#x27; with the item is that the Kerastase box was really banged up</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase hair products on-line in case they had been altered or watered down.</li>
            <li> The lack of this seal makes me suspicious that this is not authentic Kerastase, and thus I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Maybe some random conditioner??</li>

            <li> I have VERY fine hair and this product is great!!!! It gave my hair body and volume. I would definitely recommend it for fine hair ladies!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase hair products on-line in case they had been altered or watered down. I made sure to have some of my salon purchased Kerastase available in order to compare the two products once the on-line purchase arrived. To my satisfaction, they both smelled the same, the consistency is the same; packaging; is the same; and the performance is the same..... the only thing &#x27;wrong&#x27; with the item is that the Kerastase box was really banged up but it still had the cellophane wrapping -so I figure this must be why the product was sold at a discount. Doesn&#x27;t matter to me as much as the savings (over $15) so I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good and  on right time.</li>
            <li> Absolute best product for thin hair.  Does not wait it down, feels great.  I&#x27;ll be ordering my third supply soon.  Even if you can&#x27;t afford all Ketastase products,this is the one you want if you have thinner, or older, hair.</li>
            <li> This does not feel or smell like the conditioner of the exact same brand and line that I buy in the store. I have no idea what is actually in this container. Maybe an old version?? Maybe some random conditioner?? No idea.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for my fine thin hair. Recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> This is truly awesome and I love that it does exactly what it claims it will do. I will continue to buy it. Everyone talks about how &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; it smells. Hmmmmm... not so much. The smell is the ONLY thing I didn&#x27;t like. Even my husband yelled &amp;#34;Bad Perfume Alert!!&amp;#34; Thank goodness it dissipates after about 2 hours!</li>
            <li> I opened the package upon arrival, and there was no plastic cover over the product when I removed the lid. Any time I have purchased a Kerastase mask, this cover has been over the product as a seal before the first use.  The lack of this seal makes me suspicious that this is not authentic Kerastase, and thus I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> As a regular kerastase user I must say this is the best masque since masquintence, a decade ago!!</li>
            <li> I feel the difference on my hair it is more strong</li>
            <li> Great product!! Keeps your hair shiny and glossy!!</li>
            <li> lot of hair products claim all kinds of things ...I think this is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten that actually delivers on what it promises...</li>
            <li> Great product for my fine hair!</li>
            <li> I makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my hair soft and shiny, I still use other styling products but I feel this product really helps my hair look healthier and with more body.</li>
            <li> Love this product and love this price</li>
