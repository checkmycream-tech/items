            <li>This is one perfect product that really makes the nails grow long....</li>

            <li>I also discovered that it glows under UV lighting which my young niece thought was really cool!</li>
            <li>Shipment was very fast.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Was not able to find it locally and located on Amazon for a very good price.  </li>
            <li>Second coat apply to cover entire nail with no color polish which is great because it protects nail for up to a week with adding extra coat.</li>
            <li>As retired manicurist I recommend whole heartedly.</li>
            <li>I love Pink Armour...</li>
            <li>My nails have never been this long or this strong.</li>

            <li>and it normally lasts 2 weeks even though I know the directions state you should remove it weekly with regular nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I love the color alone, or I use it as base (2 coats) then 2 coats of whatever polish I want and then (1 top coat of it)</li>
            <li>The bottle is pink tinted but my nails are not; they are clear.</li>
            <li>it looks nothing like the pink tint on cover, it&#x27;s clear</li>

            <li> it looks nothing like the pink tint on cover, it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> My nails were too soft and thin to grow and always tore down to the quick until I started using Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> This also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> or they will be too long.</li>
            <li> Also I have problem nails, and see that I have healthier nails, after every single removal.</li>
            <li> And I still have over half a bottle left if this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pink Armor for 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> love...love pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I find two coats lasts for about a week then apply another coat a few days later if chipping or flaking appears.</li>
            <li> I was at a friend&#x27;s house and she had Pink Armour.</li>
            <li> and I immediately noticed my nails were shiny and harder.</li>
            <li> If I apply the Pink Armor every other day and make sure I do the ends of my nails, they grow out to lengths that I previously thought were impossible.</li>
            <li> I do add Armour every other day or two to my nails to help keep them sealed.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for me, since my fingers take a lot abuse from bleach and other chemicals that I use to maintain home.</li>
            <li> One bottle was broken and the contents were spilled all over the second bottle!</li>
            <li> I personally think, if you want decent nails you need to use this base coat always.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry nails that tend to peel and split a lot.  </li>
            <li> my nails are stronger, hard, and growing.</li>
            <li> my polish does not look thick.</li>
            <li> This nail polish sucks!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for weak, brittle stubborn nails!</li>
            <li> this is the worst buy I have ever had here!!!</li>
            <li> if you rub your nail, it comes off like a dirty pencil eraser does when you erase something, yuk!! !</li>

            <li> Good Deal, do not want to live without.</li>
            <li> Exactly what she needed!</li>
            <li> I love this gel nail polish.  Several of my friends have tried it and they like it too.  When I have a manicure I have her put the polish on and it normally lasts 2 weeks even though I know the directions state you should remove it weekly with regular nail polish remover.  This also lasts a long time.  I got one for me and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, great for nail strength and growth, my nails grew one cm in one month! I recommend this for weak, brittle stubborn nails!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pink Armor for 2 years now.  I highly recommend because it keeps your nails from chipping.  I can go a week with non-chip nails.</li>
            <li> It help my nails from breaking</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this long or this strong. Love...love...love pink Armor. Will continue to order</li>
            <li> I works just have to be consistant...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come in its original box.. One of them spilled all over the envelope it came in.. I like the product. Works for me</li>
            <li> love this it truly grows your nails</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product here on Amazon. I found it at my local Walmart for $10. Worth every single penny of it!! Love this stuff! I have used it for 4 weeks, after taking off acrylics  my nails are stronger, hard, and growing. It protects your nails. It wears nicely. I love the color alone, or I use it as base (2 coats) then 2 coats of whatever polish I want and then (1 top coat of it) funny thing.. my polish does not look thick. I personally think, if you want decent nails you need to use this base coat always. Unpainted nails, need to be protected, and this is the stuff for it! And I still have over half a bottle left if this stuff. AWESOMENESS! This stuff dries fast as well! Super plus! Also I have problem nails, and see that I have healthier nails, after every single removal. I do my nails twice weekly, removing and adding the Armour and polish. I do add Armour every other day or two to my nails to help keep them sealed.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails...and now I can...LOVE IT!!  I have recommended it to others who agree.</li>
            <li> Extremely quick shipping &amp; great price!!</li>
            <li> Even though it cost me more than I expected I&#x27;m delighted with the results of using this product.</li>
            <li> This is one perfect product that really makes the nails grow long....</li>
            <li> Best nail growth product I have ever used.  I have thin, dry nails that tend to peel and split a lot.  If I apply the Pink Armor every other day and make sure I do the ends of my nails, they grow out to lengths that I previously thought were impossible. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Was not able to find it locally and located on Amazon for a very good price.  My nails have gotten stronger and does not peel or chip since started using it.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for me, since my fingers take a lot abuse from bleach and other chemicals that I use to maintain home. I put this on after using Nail Magic by applying first coat to surrounding nail and underneath not on the fleshy part, not even near it. just the tips. Second coat apply to cover entire nail with no color polish which is great because it protects nail for up to a week with adding extra coat. I find two coats lasts for about a week then apply another coat a few days later if chipping or flaking appears.</li>
            <li> My nails were too soft and thin to grow and always tore down to the quick until I started using Pink Armor. Now I have to keep them trimmed and filed or they will be too long. I&#x27;ve searched for a product that would help my nails for 50 years and am so happy to finally find it.</li>
            <li> This Nail polish has helped strengthen my nails while giving it a pinkish tint so it looks as if I have some color on my nails.  Great product.  I also discovered that it glows under UV lighting which my young niece thought was really cool!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My polish last a couple of weeks now, vs  two days.  Not to mention my nails are growing  strong as ever after be ruined from acrylic nails.  If you are on the fence just get it. As retired manicurist I recommend whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread...</li>
            <li> This stuff truly is a miracle product for your nails. I love the shiny gloss that it leaves. My nails are stronger, healthier, longer and all together prettier when I use this.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled I found this product. I was at a friend&#x27;s house and she had Pink Armour. I used it and I immediately noticed my nails were shiny and harder. I have been using &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34; my entire life; it&#x27;s what my mom always used and I followed suit.&lt;br /&gt;Pink Armour is better. It is thicker and protects better. The bottle is pink tinted but my nails are not; they are clear. I could not find this in stores so I ordered it from Amazon. I will continue to use this product. Excellent protection for nails.</li>
            <li> Love this...used to find it at Walgreen&#x27;s. So glad I found it here! Does not chip or crack and gives nails a nice pink healthy shine! Will reorder...super price for 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> I would not even give it one star!!! this is the worst buy I have ever had here!!! This nail polish sucks! You put it on n it looks nothing like the pink tint on cover, it&#x27;s clear n if you rub your nail, it comes off like a dirty pencil eraser does when you erase something, yuk!! !I wish I can return them they cost $10/each and I would not pay a penny for them!</li>
            <li> I love Pink Armour... But I&#x27;m unsure this order was the same ... It came unpackaged... It&#x27;s thinner... Perks immediately ... Doesn&#x27;t perform as my first bottle did ... Also my daughter ordered the same and she has the same conclusion... We will never reorder from this seller again ...</li>
            <li> I really does work !!! My nails are healthy and growing.</li>
            <li> One bottle was broken and the contents were spilled all over the second bottle!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...great for strengthening and overall good natural looks</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Shipment was very fast. Very pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
