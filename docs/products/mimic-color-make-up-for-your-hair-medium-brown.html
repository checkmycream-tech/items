            <li>It is easy to apply and the Medium Brown is a perfect shade for my hair color.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage.</li>
            <li>This seems to works fairly well without adding oiliness.</li>
            <li>Love the product!  </li>
            <li>Did I mention I LOVE MIMIC?!</li>
            <li>It is great for in between coloring and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have my own applicator, but I&#x27;ve used the brushes that come with the product.  </li>
            <li>so that was nice.  </li>
            <li>It is waxy and kind of works like a crayon.</li>
            <li>I liked Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as I thought, but it&#x27;s doable!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product!  </li>
            <li>This was great at first</li>
            <li>Mimic is a great product it helps get you thru the in between colorings also is a great product for men who dont want grey in their gotee</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I decided to check if Amazon had it and was so pleased they do.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mimic Color Make-up for a  touch-up for in between colors at the stylist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told jojoba oil is more of a wax than an oil.</li>
            <li>It need not stay in my hair for more than two days.  </li>
            <li>I would say this product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a powder</li>
            <li>Mimic goes on a bit &#x27;waxy&#x27; which is why I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>pretty good for hair makeup still searching ..</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gummy or any of the negatives with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>My hair grows very quickly and my gray shows within a week of a color treatment.  </li>
            <li>This will easily get you in between visits to the salon.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>To be honest I ordered it first off of HSN, came here since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and washes out when you shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is just great for hiding gray roots just before the monthly trip to the hairdresser, and sometimes I even put it on my scalp in the part because my skin is so white showing through.  </li>
            <li>Important to know the product does have a shelf life.</li>
            <li>The absolute best of such products...</li>
            <li>best way to apply it for me was to use an new extra toothbrush I had.</li>
            <li>last purchase provided the best quality of the prior 2 times purchased, creamy, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It gives me an additional 1/2 week to a full week between appointments.</li>
            <li>They are adequate.  </li>
            <li>Provides good coverage on grey roots.  </li>
            <li>But after watching a video on HSN, I was intrigued and decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting eyebrow coverage.</li>
            <li>The first order lasted me around 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>love this stuff, gives me several weeks in between coloring!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third and each one lasts me a good year, using periodically on my roots and daily on my brows.  </li>
            <li>Most of the color touch up products seem to dry out way too fast!  </li>
            <li>It covers the grey in seconds, like magic.</li>
            <li>It takes too much time and effort.</li>
            <li>However, it is not that easy to cover grey hair roots with it, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>Does the job better than any other product I can find.</li>
            <li>I originally saw a similar product on a home shopping program but couldn&#x27;t get the color I needed</li>
            <li>and although at times I&#x27;ve been cajoled into trying other products I always return and am always exceedingly glad I did.  </li>
            <li>First, I like the natural looking color of the hair product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold and would highly recommend it if you need something to use to extend time between colorings.</li>
            <li>It is true that it will start to dry out a bit</li>
            <li>This allows me to continue the illusion that my hair is naturally brown until I get it colored again.  </li>
            <li>This product covers the gray completely and stays on until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>(I recently bought Rita Hazan&#x27;s root cover up and really like it.)  </li>
            <li>It is a bit time consuming to apply, but it looks natural, really does cover my grey roots, and it stays until I shampoo it out.  </li>
            <li>After all, I already had a drawer full of root touch-up crayons, sprays, and powders that are either too sticky, gummy, messy, or itchy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mimic for several years with hard-to-cover gray (white hair, really)</li>
            <li>have had mine for several months and it has not dried out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it seems like the product is not covering, but I remembered the video said a few strokes in each area might be necessary.  </li>
            <li>Great concept but very disappointing.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the product closed as it does have a tendency to become a little dried out over time.</li>
            <li>other products i have tried looked dry this blends in very well.</li>
            <li>Seems like a bad deal for the consumer, although this product does a relatively good job covering gray.  </li>

            <li> You have to pull the hair flat and rub the brush back and forth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To address some of the negative comments:&lt;br /&gt;it is not difficult or time consuming to apply.  </li>
            <li> My Mimic brand product in dark brown dried out after the first fews weeks of usage.  </li>
            <li> I do have a lot of grey</li>
            <li> It takes a long time and effort to get it onto one&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> The product tends to dry out after a couple of months, then when you apply the product to hair it will flake.</li>
            <li> I can use the product wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, come off on pillows, or color your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my brows everyday, too.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve done to try and re-moisturize the dried out product before using it, is to rub a drop of jojoba oil into the product and then apply it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> but then it dried out on me.  </li>
            <li> It blends well and it is not opaque like other similar products, which look fake.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do to get it to me moist again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like hard wax and it clumps together.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t use it all the time the make-up gets hard making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Not effective for all over color coverage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical even after reading all of the glowing reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> Ithelps me make it all the way to 4 weeks instead of the dreaded 3 which can get expensive at the shop.  </li>
            <li> but its like a paste and is difficult to get on the brush and use.  </li>
            <li> this stuff was awful and irritated my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it daily for my eyebrows.  Stays on even after sweating at the gym.  I start using it in my hair about 2 1/2 weeks after I get my hair colored.  This allows me to continue the illusion that my hair is naturally brown until I get it colored again.  It gives me an additional 1/2 week to a full week between appointments. No white roots!&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the negative comments:&lt;br /&gt;it is not difficult or time consuming to apply.  There are some videos on youtube that will show you how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for several months and it has not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell.  I have no idea why someone would comment about the smell.</li>
            <li> Does the job better than any other product I can find.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical even after reading all of the glowing reviews of this product.  After all, I already had a drawer full of root touch-up crayons, sprays, and powders that are either too sticky, gummy, messy, or itchy.  But after watching a video on HSN, I was intrigued and decided it was worth a try.  I have to say that it is truly AMAZING!  At first it seems like the product is not covering, but I remembered the video said a few strokes in each area might be necessary.  It is a bit time consuming to apply, but it looks natural, really does cover my grey roots, and it stays until I shampoo it out.

            <li> Love, Love, Love this product!  My hair grows very quickly and my gray shows within a week of a color treatment.  This product covers the gray completely and stays on until you wash it out.  I use it on my brows everyday, too.  I have my own applicator, but I&#x27;ve used the brushes that come with the product.  They are adequate.  This product works best with hair with a part.  Not effective for all over color coverage.</li>
            <li> Provides good coverage on grey roots.  The product tends to dry out after a couple of months, then when you apply the product to hair it will flake.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It covers the grey in seconds, like magic.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Allows me a week or two between colorings...</li>
            <li> The absolute best of such products...Stays on until washed off. Not messy.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this product. I use it on my eyebrows to cover up the gray.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof.  i touch up my roots and it lasts til my next wash.&lt;br /&gt;My dad has been using it to cover up the gray in his mustache!  lol</li>
            <li> This will easily get you in between visits to the salon.  It goes on smoothly and washes out when you shampoo.  Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Mimic is a great product it helps get you thru the in between colorings also is a great product for men who dont want grey in their gotee</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product on HSN but could no longer get it from there.  I decided to check if Amazon had it and was so pleased they do.  It is just great for hiding gray roots just before the monthly trip to the hairdresser, and sometimes I even put it on my scalp in the part because my skin is so white showing through.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this Mimic Color Make-up for a  touch-up for in between colors at the stylist. Ithelps me make it all the way to 4 weeks instead of the dreaded 3 which can get expensive at the shop.  It does the job and works great on my eyebrows also. Make sure to keep the product closed as it does have a tendency to become a little dried out over time.</li>
            <li> The color matched my hair well, but the application took a bit longer than I had time for.  It did last all day though so that was nice.  I do have a lot of grey so I prefer root cover up products that are an aerosol type of application.  (I recently bought Rita Hazan&#x27;s root cover up and really like it.)  I am using the remainder of this product to fill in my eyebrows since it comes with a two sided brush.</li>
            <li> I liked Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> pretty good for hair makeup still searching ..</li>
            <li> Great long lasting eyebrow coverage.</li>
            <li> my hair is thinning and not only does this help with covering my gray roots between coloring,&lt;br /&gt; but is it is great at hiding my scalp. I can use the product wet or dry. Nobody realizes how&lt;br /&gt;thin my hair has become because of mimic.</li>
            <li> Perfect for in-between coloring!!</li>
            <li> Product also works well to help camouflage spots with thinning hair!&lt;br /&gt;This last purchase provided the best quality of the prior 2 times purchased, creamy, easy to apply.  Important to know the product does have a shelf life.</li>
            <li> It stays on until washed out.  I&#x27;m a Med. Blonde, but this color works for me.  It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as I thought, but it&#x27;s doable!</li>
            <li> this stuff was awful and irritated my skin.  it&#x27;s like hard wax and it clumps together. don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Most of the color touch up products seem to dry out way too fast!  I think the manufacturers need to the improve moisture retention or reduce the prices.  My Mimic brand product in dark brown dried out after the first fews weeks of usage.  I bought a 2nd one and the same thing happened.  In both cases I had only used  about 10% of the product.  I contacted the seller and they just shined me on saying that didn&#x27;t accept returns or exchanges.  Seems like a bad deal for the consumer, although this product does a relatively good job covering gray.  What I&#x27;ve done to try and re-moisturize the dried out product before using it, is to rub a drop of jojoba oil into the product and then apply it.  This seems to works fairly well without adding oiliness. I&#x27;m told jojoba oil is more of a wax than an oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product..fast delivery! !</li>
            <li> I use this for eyebrows. Works well but if you don&#x27;t use it all the time the make-up gets hard making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would cover the grays at the hairline.  It is easy to use but it did not match my hair color too well.  It need not stay in my hair for more than two days.  Plus, it would come off if I touched my hair.  I will continue to use it but I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> To be honest I ordered it first off of HSN, came here since it was cheaper. The first order lasted me around 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to apply it for me was to use an new extra toothbrush I had. It works perfect. I have tried diffrent kinds of \\&quot;like\\&quot; products to touch up my color and this will always be my go to... Love it!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, gives me several weeks in between coloring! i would recommend this product! other products i have tried looked dry this blends in very well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and the Medium Brown is a perfect shade for my hair color.  I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  The product works great to cover up greys and shades thinning areas.  I use this daily as part of my beauty make-up routine.  It also works to shade in my eyebrows and stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This was great at first but then it dried out on me.  Not sure what to do to get it to me moist again.</li>
            <li> First, I like the natural looking color of the hair product. It blends well and it is not opaque like other similar products, which look fake. However, it is not that easy to cover grey hair roots with it, which is why I bought it. It is waxy and kind of works like a crayon. So imagine trying to rub a crayon (in this case, the product on a brush) onto hair with body. You have to pull the hair flat and rub the brush back and forth. It takes too much time and effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third and each one lasts me a good year, using periodically on my roots and daily on my brows.  It is true that it will start to dry out a bit but I have a fix - I use a drop or two of food-grade mineral oil, the kind that you would put on a wood cutting board or chopping block.  It totally does the trick.  I do it as needed and get use out of every last bit of the product.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is just okay.  It takes a long time and effort to get it onto one&#x27;s hair and I just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li> I originally saw a similar product on a home shopping program but couldn&#x27;t get the color I needed so I decided to try Amazon.  I thought it would be more of a powder but its like a paste and is difficult to get on the brush and use.  Great concept but very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Mimic goes on a bit &#x27;waxy&#x27; which is why I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;waxy&#x27; but it STAYS put once you apply it to your roots.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, come off on pillows, or color your scalp.  It goes where you want it, stays where you put it, and blends to the point that I can&#x27;t tell where I applied it.  I&#x27;ve used Mimic for several years with hard-to-cover gray (white hair, really) and although at times I&#x27;ve been cajoled into trying other products I always return and am always exceedingly glad I did.  I should carry extras in my purse to share because if someone&#x27;s going to take time to color her or his graying hair, then the roots should never be a give-away!  Did I mention I LOVE MIMIC?!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is great for in between coloring and so easy to use.  Brushes let you get the edges up close.</li>
