    <ol>
            <li>Great !</li>
            <li>These clamps are perfect for this propose.</li>
            <li>but they were a great price!!</li>
            <li>These I bought were perfect, although, I did not need a pack of three, it was helpful to keep them in difference places in my house to access them conveniently.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is great.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great, not just for keeping in place rollers, but also for olding your hair in place when washing your hair.</li>
            <li>Also, eighteen of them is a great deal for what I paid.</li>
            <li>It was a great tip</li>
            <li>These are great clips for the price.</li>
            <li>great product - works perfectly with all roller sizes and also can be used for catchup when dyeing hair :) - Ros Dublin Ireland</li>
            <li>They work good</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them and the price was great.</li>
            <li>and I am sure another person would greatly appreciate the tip.</li>
            <li>These clips are perfect for setting hair on hot rollers, the reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li>In any event, they&#x27;re better than those pins that come out and sometimes spring across the room!</li>
            <li>Hanging on to them they could come in handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price also after looking around at different products this one is the best for the price.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to add weight (as some do) on the roller which is good for fine hair.</li>
            <li>STRONG HOLD!  </li>
            <li>Great roller clips they fit all size rollers and were very comfortable with a strong hold.</li>
            <li>Great clip for my hot rods.</li>
            <li>The clips are not curved like older clamp I&#x27;ve had so they don&#x27;t fit around the rollers the best</li>
            <li>They could be better, though.  </li>
            <li>Should have paid more for the others...</li>
            <li>More than I thought I would get.</li>
            <li>but I wish I had paid more close attention to the way they were designed before purchasing</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>While these do have a good &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t rounded so they don&#x27;t fit around a curler very well.</li>
            <li>Strong hold.</li>
            <li>They stick way out and have zero give since they&#x27;re so sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>These work okay.  Much better than those pin things that came with my sets of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair and</li>
            <li>Work fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem very strong to hold hot rollers</li>
            <li>I thought these would be flimsy because they were so cheap</li>
            <li>Definitely works great for when I use my heated curling rods.</li>
            <li>Still, I was able to use them with hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to use with my hot rollers in hope they&#x27;d hold the curler better.</li>
            <li>(thank God) and would recommend those, they are much easier to use, much better quality and work just fine:</li>
            <li>Easy to handle on hot rollers.</li>
            <li>These hold my hot rollers securely in place.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the old style hot roller clips.</li>
            <li>These are very very ineffective.</li>
            <li>Bought for hot rollers...</li>
            <li>If you are planning on ordering Hot Rollers or already have them, consider using these.</li>
            <li>These do not go around my large curlers</li>
            <li>a slightly rounder clip would be better and feel more secure, but they do the job and are much easier then the little wire pins.</li>
            <li>I mean, these have to be the most durable, sturdy, strong clips on the market.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit on my jumbo size rollers but they hold on to smaller size rollers and/or straight to the hair.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t grip around the curler as much as I thought they would.</li>
            <li>It is an absolute must</li>
            <li>I like these because they really do hold your curlers in well.</li>
            <li>you really have to adjust it so it can stay.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to use with the Hot Rollers I ordered, they are terrific.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a round shape but they hold on to my large Velcro rollers all right.</li>
            <li>simple and convenient but don&#x27;t work well on regular large heated curlers</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold the medium and large size rollers as well as the other style, and they leave an even bigger bump.</li>
            <li>Ok if you are using small rollers ( up to 1&amp;#34; round).</li>

            <li> Ok if you are using small rollers ( up to 1&amp;#34; round).</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t open wide enough for larger rollers.</li>
            <li> But the sides are completely flat, which I couldn&#x27;t tell from the photos.  </li>
            <li> these are very hard to open up and put on my hot rollers and I end up burning my fingers</li>
            <li> I use this product after diffusing my curly hair 90% dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have small hands and still had to fight with these to get them to work, which some never would even open!  </li>
            <li> I never liked the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; left in my hair after the other style clamp, so I ordered these.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product because I have natural hair that it&#x27;s very thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I got these because I always lose the little wire clips that come with the roller set.</li>
            <li> but they leave a little mark in your hair.</li>
            <li> every size roller is held firmly and in place.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use if you have RA,</li>
            <li> I hate setting my hair with hot rollers and the pins getting hotter as the heat transfers from the roller to the pin to your head!  </li>
            <li> The plastic has sharp pieces where you need to squeeze and if that isn&#x27;t painful enough, squeezing to open these big things is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I tried to use just to hold my hair up for a shower and they don&#x27;t work like that at all on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>

            <li> I never liked the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; left in my hair after the other style clamp, so I ordered these. They don&#x27;t hold the medium and large size rollers as well as the other style, and they leave an even bigger bump. So, I don&#x27;t think it was an improvement.</li>
            <li> I got these because I always lose the little wire clips that come with the roller set. These hold my hot rollers securely in place.  Plus the price is great.</li>
            <li> These work okay.  Much better than those pin things that came with my sets of hot rollers.  They could be better, though.  I tried to use just to hold my hair up for a shower and they don&#x27;t work like that at all on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> These clips do  not hold a roller clip.  They suck.  And they don&#x27;t open wide enough for larger rollers. Ok if you are using small rollers ( up to 1&amp;#34; round).</li>
            <li> Not easy to use if you have RA, BUT THEY HOLD WELL</li>
            <li> Bought for hot rollers...work great..good value.</li>
            <li> Strong hold. STRONG HOLD!  But the sides are completely flat, which I couldn&#x27;t tell from the photos.  Still, I was able to use them with hot rollers.  I mean, these have to be the most durable, sturdy, strong clips on the market.  If they had curved sides (rounded, whatever) I&#x27;d have given them 5 stars.  I think they&#x27;re for foam rollers, but no way you can sleep in these.  NO WAY.  They stick way out and have zero give since they&#x27;re so sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> Should have paid more for the others... These do not go around my large curlers</li>
            <li> The plastic has sharp pieces where you need to squeeze and if that isn&#x27;t painful enough, squeezing to open these big things is very difficult. I don&#x27;t even have small hands and still had to fight with these to get them to work, which some never would even open!  I bought the Conair clips also (thank God) and would recommend those, they are much easier to use, much better quality and work just fine: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R87B1Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_63</li>
            <li> Easy to handle on hot rollers. Great ! More than I thought I would get.</li>

While these do have a good &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t rounded so they don&#x27;t fit around a curler very well. I&#x27;m still going to use them but I wish I had paid more close attention to the way they were designed before purchasing</li>
            <li> They work good but they leave a little mark in your hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great, not just for keeping in place rollers, but also for olding your hair in place when washing your hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product because I have natural hair that it&#x27;s very thick and curly. It is an absolute must that i section my hair when washing and blow drying. These clamps are perfect for this propose.</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect for setting hair on hot rollers, the reason I purchased them. Also, eighteen of them is a great deal for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use with the Hot Rollers I ordered, they are terrific. I have fine, shoulder length hair and every size roller is held firmly and in place. They don&#x27;t seem to add weight (as some do) on the roller which is good for fine hair. If you are planning on ordering Hot Rollers or already have them, consider using these.</li>
            <li> I ordered these, come to find out I didn&#x27;t need them.  Hanging on to them they could come in handy.</li>
            <li> I hate setting my hair with hot rollers and the pins getting hotter as the heat transfers from the roller to the pin to your head!  OUCH!  These clamps keep your rollers in place with no heat transfer!</li>
            <li> Great roller clips they fit all size rollers and were very comfortable with a strong hold. Much better than the old style hot roller clips.</li>

            <li> They dont grip well at all. The rollers slid out. you really have to adjust it so it can stay.</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube video for curly hair that showed using clips to give volume to your curly hair while drying. These I bought were perfect, although, I did not need a pack of three, it was helpful to keep them in difference places in my house to access them conveniently. Or you can just give them away to people with curly hair. It was a great tip and I am sure another person would greatly appreciate the tip.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. Can never seem to get them to open up using only 1 hand. Ended up throwing out.</li>
            <li> Great clip for my hot rods. I thought these would be flimsy because they were so cheap but they are NOT! Definitely works great for when I use my heated curling rods.</li>
            <li> Work fine. Just wish they were easier to squeeze open.  In any event, they&#x27;re better than those pins that come out and sometimes spring across the room!</li>
            <li> These are great clips for the price. Don&#x27;t seem very strong to hold hot rollers and I wonder how they would perform on those. They don&#x27;t have a round shape but they hold on to my large Velcro rollers all right. They don&#x27;t fit on my jumbo size rollers but they hold on to smaller size rollers and/or straight to the hair. They are okay.</li>
            <li> I use this product after diffusing my curly hair 90% dry.  I clip the hair back and allow it to set for about ten minutes!</li>
            <li> great product - works perfectly with all roller sizes and also can be used for catchup when dyeing hair :) - Ros Dublin Ireland</li>
