            <li>and i left the shaver charger cord in New Jersey</li>
            <li>Although the seller provided an adapter, it was still not a really good fit.  </li>

            <li> On a recent plane trip, I lost a small bag on the shuttle bus that took me from the airport to the airport parking lot.  The bag contained the Braun Pulsonic Shaver Charger Cord for my current shaver.  Without the cord, there is no way to power up the shaver when the battery is expended.  It was along on the three-week trip \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; the shaver battery went down.  The battery lasted just fine for the entire trip, but it was low.  When I arrived at home, I realized that the cord was gone, so I could not charge or shave.  I immediately went to Amazon.com, found the replacement cord and ordered it.  Due to your quick delivery time, the cord got here before the shaver battery went dead.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have a Braun Pulsonic shaver and i left the shaver charger cord in New Jersey and I live in Alaska. I couldn&#x27;t find the charging cord anywhere in Alaska so i ordered it form Amazon and it got here in half the time Amazon told me it would and it worked like a dream. Thank You</li>
            <li> Genuine article delivered in two days.. It is so important  to get the manufacturer&#x27;s cord for these shavers as the power transformer is in the plug. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about the adapter now.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I had this delivered to my hotel while on a business trip ... I left my original one in the shavers &#x27;cleaning&#x27; unit ... Back home, I couldnt tell the difference between this and the original cord ... Both OEM products .... I leave my second cord in my suitcase permanently now ....</li>
            <li> I lost my original cord and bought this as a replacement. It is sturdy and while I bought it to plug into the cleaning/charging unit I also sometimes take with me. It travels well and doesn&#x27;t seem to get tangled. I think I paid around 16-17 dollars for the unit and considering how hard they are to find I was very happy with the price. It seems to charge just as fast as the original</li>
            <li> This cord has character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many cords have character. But this one does. I love plugging it in and then unplugging it later.</li>
            <li> Great to find replacement since the shaver is expensive. I left mine in a hotel room and was unsure I could find one. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It works on the razor but not on the Braun Pulsonic Clean and Charge Base Unit.  Quite disappointed, but it does charge the razor.</li>
            <li> Transformer died on the original one, great replacement.  FYI... bought from seller &amp;#34;Goodies&amp;#34; and the plug-in was straight and does not have the 90° angle as shown, but still works fine.</li>
            <li> The cord works for my 760cc Braun Razor.  I would have given 5 stars, but the price while comparatively good, is more than a power cord should cost.</li>
            <li> The charger was a real Braun product, not a genetic version of original. Works very well with my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my travel bag for recharging while out of town.  That way I don&#x27;t have to remember to disconnect the cord from the recharging and cleaning stand in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this charger for my Braun 790CC-4.  For those wondering, I got the Hugo Boss edition from a German seller.  The charger that originally came with it does not work with the outlets here in the United States.  Although the seller provided an adapter, it was still not a really good fit.  So I bought this.  Now I can charge my shaver with ease.</li>
            <li> When we bought a Braun cleander and tried it out it didn&#x27;t work.  Contacted Amazon and the dealer.  The dealer was very knowledgeable and told us it is probably the cord.  He was absolutely right.  Bought a new cord and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Exact fit for my shaver. Lost the original and this is working well. A tough find but worth the search</li>
            <li> Works well even for cleaning station</li>
            <li> i had to get this adapter coz i forgot to get mine when i moved to the states .... as all braun products it works flawlessly .... but at $30 its ridiculously priced ... i was actually  considering getting one of the cheaper shavers  which were about $50 .... but the quality and the satisfaction of using a series 7 is way too high to compromise ... so i went ahead and bought it ...  but bottom line is TOO EXPENSIVE !!</li>
            <li> It works good just like an OEM cord should and quick shipping  I would recommend</li>
            <li> Listed for my model but does not work as expected. Will charge razor but not work with cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is an OEM piece and it works perfectly.  I tuck this in my travel suitcase and don&#x27;t have to mess remembering to take the one that came with my razor.  It works perfectly and is light and take almost no space at all in my bag.</li>
            <li> Works well, no overheating problems</li>
            <li> Delivered quick and works well. I was in a bind when i lost my charger while travelling. This took care of my problem :-)</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. And it arrived much earlier than promised. Now I have a cord exclusively for travel.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and matched my razor.</li>
            <li> absolutely matched my original cord</li>
