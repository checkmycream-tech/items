            <li>It was perfect!  </li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll be perfect for my husband&#x27;s halloween costume.</li>
            <li>This was awesome.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a great idea</li>
            <li>looks great ,worked out great ,not reccomended for hairy faces</li>
            <li>instead of facepaint I use that maybeline 24 hr color tattoo powder eye shadow - great for shading.</li>
            <li>The end results looked just as good as the examples used on the packaging.</li>
            <li>but they look good in the package.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I used them a couple of days ago fora party, and it took about 20 minutes for each of us to achieve amazing results.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a Halloween party and it was a huge hit!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see the outline of the tattoo and will be able to cut around it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instructions for putting on the tattoo, just know that it will take a bit more time for the parts to set with foundation.</li>
            <li>Be sure to set everythig with translucent setting powder&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Better instructions and</li>
            <li>Very detailed in the skeleton and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Use this as a base/outline for a more elaborate face paint on hubby for halloween... fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful effect, though the instructions were a bit too minimal.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply just remember to remove the plastic backing before applying-</li>
            <li>The overall tattoo looked pretty good, a lot better than what I would have been able to paint on.</li>
            <li>I should have looked at the picture to get the tattoos lined up right on my husband&#x27;s face, but they are really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Also, shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the skull to have a good contrast and a white foundation</li>
            <li>It really looked like a tattoo!</li>
            <li>I used a warm wet rag to dampen each tattoo segment as I put them on.</li>
            <li>Does not look exactly as it does on the picture; but it is a temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>It works exactly like the ones we purchase for our kids.</li>
            <li>I hope to have more for next Halloween.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I ordered three of these because the first one didn&#x27;t really stick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1) cut the transfer into sections, instead of trying to put it all on at once - much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gotta tell you, I was skeptical that doing a makeup job for Halloween would be as easy as applying temporary tattoos, but these things were outstanding!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If they apply like a normal temp tattoo should then my rating could go up to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>; however with a black waterproof eyeliner it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Ok but hard to get on face.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something that looked subpar, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This was for my 13 year old son.  </li>
            <li>adding additional white &amp; black really brings out the shadows and highlights and makes it pop.</li>

            <li> Very cool difficult to take off</li>
            <li> Also, it should be noted that you need black and gray face makeup to complete your look..</li>
            <li> My husband looked fantastic eerily scary - did not want to find him in my closet.  </li>
            <li> The other side had the tatoo printed on the other side of the paper so it was for the same side of the face.</li>
            <li> Response from other party goers was quite satisying.</li>
            <li> so I did have to add to my boyfriend&#x27;s design, just so it didn&#x27;t look odd.</li>
            <li> as a black guy, I wan kinda skeptical as to whether or not this would work for me.</li>
            <li> I started by cutting the tattoo in to smaller manageable parts.</li>
            <li> Each face took about half an hour to do, cutting it up into sections.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had to paint all of the details on by hand.</li>
            <li> The bad?</li>
            <li> could not get the image to transfer to skin :(</li>

            <li> Very detailed in the skeleton and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Too man flaws in the product design to even begin to apply to your face. It seemed like a great idea but unfortunately I had to paint all of the details on by hand.</li>
            <li> Ok but hard to get on face.</li>
            <li> I gotta tell you, I was skeptical that doing a makeup job for Halloween would be as easy as applying temporary tattoos, but these things were outstanding! My girlfriend and I used them a couple of days ago fora party, and it took about 20 minutes for each of us to achieve amazing results. I was expecting something that looked subpar, but I was pleasantly surprised. The end results looked just as good as the examples used on the packaging. We got compliments all night! Recommended.</li>
            <li> It was perfect!  It really looked like a tattoo!</li>
            <li> The overall tattoo looked pretty good, a lot better than what I would have been able to paint on. The bad? Well, you might suffocate putting it on since there are no holes to breath out of, also not made for a larger face...so I did have to add to my boyfriend&#x27;s design, just so it didn&#x27;t look odd. I think we might try it again this next Halloween.</li>
            <li> could not get the image to transfer to skin :(</li>
            <li> as a black guy, I wan kinda skeptical as to whether or not this would work for me. So, I made a plan. I started by cutting the tattoo in to smaller manageable parts. You&#x27;ll see the outline of the tattoo and will be able to cut around it. Then, I used a white foundation for my face before applying the skull face tatttoo. I really wanted the skull to have a good contrast and a white foundation worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions for putting on the tattoo, just know that it will take a bit more time for the parts to set with foundation. I used a warm wet rag to dampen each tattoo segment as I put them on. I also used an eyeliner pen to retrace or fill-in any parts of the skull that needed darkening or that didn&#x27;t transfer properly.</li>
            <li> Came with tatoo printed out on only one side of face. The other side had the tatoo printed on the other side of the paper so it was for the same side of the face. Basically got screwed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My husband looked fantastic eerily scary - did not want to find him in my closet.  Easy to apply just remember to remove the plastic backing before applying- yes a bonehead thing to do, but it did happen when we applied the upper jaw; however with a black waterproof eyeliner it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used these yet but they look good in the package. If they apply like a normal temp tattoo should then my rating could go up to 5 stars. They&#x27;ll be perfect for my husband&#x27;s halloween costume.</li>
            <li> looks great ,worked out great ,not reccomended for hairy faces</li>
            <li> This was awesome.  I should have looked at the picture to get the tattoos lined up right on my husband&#x27;s face, but they are really easy to apply.  I also forgot to remove the plastic for one piece, and there is no way to salvage it.  Had to use some eye liner.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not look exactly as it does on the picture; but it is a temporary tattoo. It works exactly like the ones we purchase for our kids.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Halloween party and it was a huge hit! It turned out just like the advertised picture. I didn&#x27;t take it off (with wash cloth and mineral oil) until the next morning and it didn&#x27;t come off on my pillow at all. Definitely something I might purchase again. Also, shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Use this as a base/outline for a more elaborate face paint on hubby for halloween... fantastic.  couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) cut the transfer into sections, instead of trying to put it all on at once - much easier.&lt;br /&gt;2) adding additional white &amp; black really brings out the shadows and highlights and makes it pop. instead of facepaint I use that maybeline 24 hr color tattoo powder eye shadow - great for shading. Be sure to set everythig with translucent setting powder&lt;br /&gt;3) If you follow the steps above, this will not budge. All that rubbish about eye makeup remover/baby oil is nonsense.  The only thing that has ever removed it for me is Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope those help someone!</li>
            <li> This was for my 13 year old son.  Better instructions and maybe a tutorial online would be helpful.  Thankfully, I ordered three of these because the first one didn&#x27;t really stick.  I think that if the material that the tattoo was made of was thicker it would help.  Also, it should be noted that you need black and gray face makeup to complete your look.. Without them, your results will look nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Very cool difficult to take off</li>
            <li> Wonderful effect, though the instructions were a bit too minimal. Each face took about half an hour to do, cutting it up into sections. Response from other party goers was quite satisying.</li>
            <li> I love this! I hope to have more for next Halloween.</li>
