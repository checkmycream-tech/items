            <li>A very nice bonus.</li>
            <li>However, it is a trimmer and is okay at best when it comes to</li>
            <li>I think it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>All in all a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>The nicest feature about the Wahl is that it is rechargeable, and lasts a good month on one charge.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Rechargable is nice but unit doesn&#x27;t cut as well as some cheaper ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>There aren&#x27;t many of these around that are rechargeable.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>I am just giving up on Wahl and rechargeable trimmers, and will find something better quality.  </li>
            <li>YOU GET THE MORE HAIR GROWS IN THE WEIRDEST PLACES, IN YOUR NOSE, IN YOUR EARS, ON YOUR EARLOBES ON THE TIP OF YOU NOSE</li>
            <li>FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>its great to have a nose and ear trimmer that charges who wants to add battiers all the time...</li>
            <li>is junk but extremely satisfying product bought 6 more for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>I had a Wahl battery powered trimmer, but this one seems to have a lot more power weather</li>
            <li>I was looking for a rechargable trimmer and as far as that goes, this one is great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Worked amazing at first.  </li>
            <li>Average at best!</li>
            <li>This one works fine for me.</li>
            <li>The motor is nice and strong and fast.  </li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer is nice, but if you are not used to using a beard trimmer with attachments I don&#x27;t recommend practicing on your brows as you can easily make a mistake that is very noticable.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t an indicator light on it.  </li>
            <li>The attachment is really flimsy and kind of hacks up my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They said I had to pay to send them the melted unit and all of the additional parts, and pay shipping for a replacement, which would have exceeded the original price tag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very conscious about my nose hair and this product came in handy.</li>
            <li>It stopped growing so much on the top of my head, but continues to grow out of my eyebrows, nose, and ears.</li>
            <li>This unit is keeping me looking respectable and it is always ready to go, no hassles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t come with a true \\&quot;recharger base\\&quot; like some competitors</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also true that you&#x27;re getting a lot for your $20 here.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer and a detailed oriented person.  </li>
            <li>So you have about 3 minutes of use on a full charge before it dies.  </li>
            <li>I have really full eyebrows and am just looking to keep them under control.</li>
            <li>and it trims my nose hair very clean and fast without hurting me.</li>
            <li>Have an older battery operated model that is much more thorough.</li>
            <li>the dependability n durability of this product.i had to start using my wahl beard n mustache trimmer now, the nose n ear attachment on it works great and has lasted a pretty long time now.</li>
            <li>First try and it locked up!</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a powerful little motor (unlike some I&#x27;ve owned) and is able to do the job quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li>It did not have enough rpm&#x27;s to not pull the hair, but it trimmed nice and close.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t lose it the last time it was charged, but I guess it was such a brilliant place</li>
            <li>Wahl offered to send me a new one and, that works pretty good, especially if you periodically clean it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, which is not exactly expensive to begin with.</li>
            <li>Going back to the Mangroomer, didn&#x27;t last but a couple months but worked great when used.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose trimmer</li>
            <li>Cheap build is clearly visible.</li>
            <li>But I at least have a nose trimmer, that I am happy about.</li>
            <li>Whal products excellent everything that i have owned in the past and present.</li>
            <li>Strange, because most of the Wahl products i have do have this -  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and it works very well..</li>
            <li>You need to really move it around to achieve a decent trim.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, this thing will just shave them right off.</li>
            <li>It worked ok while it worked, but the rechargeable battery did not last to my next birthday.  </li>
            <li>My older Panasonic ER411 blows this trimmer out of the water in terms of trimming effectiveness.     </li>
            <li>THE OLDER</li>
            <li>I bought this particular trimmer because of the eyebrow trimming feature as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This worked fine for the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>this product is ok in the way it performs when it is working, but mine stopped working within a few months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several over the years (including the little manual kind)</li>
            <li>just leave the other top next to it stand</li>
            <li>My trimmer arriaved missing one of the the attachment, and the one that did come is not that strong.  </li>
            <li>Clearly something malfunctioned with the motor and/or battery.</li>
            <li>With scissors, I was only getting so much in my nose.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t trim very close.  </li>
            <li>Too cheap to return, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li>after using the panasonic version, and a few others with non-rechargeable batteries, I am convinced this one is the strongest and sharpest trimmer available.</li>
            <li>Like most people I used it for a couple of minutes at a time, then again a few days later, etc.</li>
            <li>it might not do the job but for those of us with 100% human DNA this little trimmer has more than enough power.</li>

            <li> There are alot of different attachments and there are guides that say how long a charge will run for the amount of time on the charger</li>
            <li> The Wahl leave the hair too long</li>
            <li> After about a month, which corresponded to less than 30 minutes total use, it spun to a halt.</li>
            <li> is really not needed</li>
            <li> The rechargeable function is nice and I have not had the problems with the base that I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that trims at a constant speed thanks to a rechargeable battery that&#x27;s always topped off, unlike 99% of the trimmers on the market that run on regular batteries which get weaker and weaker speed with every use and therefore tend to pull your hair instead of cutting it!</li>
            <li> so the other option is to send all of it to them.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a while, but after a few months it started to loose</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does all that it&#x27;s supposed to do with typical Wahl efficiency (I already use their hair clippers) but the stand needs improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Missing parts, and parts that do work, do so</li>
            <li> After recharging overnight, it worked for another few minutes, then stopped again.</li>
            <li> I have a battery powered nose trimmer that I use, so it was a few days before I tried the nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> the cord needs somewhere to moor it firmly</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve used it was to trim my nose hair</li>
            <li> pity it didn&#x27;t have some sort of lid, at least over the small components section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And products with batteries tend to slow down when the batteries lose power.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have recently reached the age where I would need one of these and received it as a (morbid, if practical) birthday gift.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a rechargeable one because I&#x27;ve had the battery-powered cordless ones in the past.  </li>
            <li> The other option is to leave it plugged in - meaning you&#x27;ll have lots of slack cord on your counter-top and the storage base will likely tip over when the cord catches on it - like it did for me this morning.    </li>
            <li> The heads are a bit difficult to change but other than that it works well.  </li>
            <li> Given the small price tag, that may be common, but it was a little disappointing to find myself shopping for another one so soon.</li>
            <li> Slowing down means pulling instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> This device simply doesn&#x27;t trim well and the base is essentially a useless piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak even when running.  </li>
            <li> Now, unfortunately, I have lost the charging cord, so it is useless to me until I find it.  </li>
            <li> I think the blade is bad.  </li>
            <li> They run out of juice while using, resulting in painful pulling of nose hair.  </li>
            <li> The storage base is NOT a recharging base (as is the case with, say, my Sonicare toothbrush).    </li>
            <li> This device is worthless.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst i have ever had.</li>
            <li> Hopeless, below expectations and a nasty product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to be continually hassling with batteries. And products with batteries tend to slow down when the batteries lose power. Slowing down means pulling instead of cutting. With the rechargeable, I always have a fully powered unit and I never have to buy or replace batteries. As I age, my hair has migrated. It stopped growing so much on the top of my head, but continues to grow out of my eyebrows, nose, and ears. I like the eyebrow attachment on this unit; it works great. With scissors, I was only getting so much in my nose. With this unit, I can get at the hairs and not have to trim so often. This unit is keeping me looking respectable and it is always ready to go, no hassles. I think it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer! I&#x27;ve had several over the years (including the little manual kind) but this is the one I&#x27;d choose again and again. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t come with a true \\&quot;recharger base\\&quot; like some competitors, it&#x27;s also true that you&#x27;re getting a lot for your $20 here. This trimmer has a powerful little motor (unlike some I&#x27;ve owned) and is able to do the job quickly and nicely. I suppose if you had insect hair (like Jeff Goldblum in \\&quot;The Fly\\&quot;) it might not do the job but for those of us with 100% human DNA this little trimmer has more than enough power. And only three minutes for a recharge that lasts for several months (and it does)?! A very nice bonus. Finally, while a trimmer might not seem like sexiest tool in the world it sure is nice to have one you can depend on.</li>
            <li> this is a great trimmer.  the only setback is you don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s recharged or not.  There isn&#x27;t an indicator light on it.  Strange, because most of the Wahl products i have do have this -  and it&#x27;s a big help.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a rechargable trimmer and as far as that goes, this one is great.  The motor is nice and strong and fast.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t trim very close.  I had a Panasonic trimmer that was battery operated.  It did not have enough rpm&#x27;s to not pull the hair, but it trimmed nice and close.  The Wahl leave the hair too long</li>
            <li> This trimmer only trims moderately well. Have an older battery operated model that is much more thorough.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many of these around that are rechargeable. This one works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have recently reached the age where I would need one of these and received it as a (morbid, if practical) birthday gift.  It worked ok while it worked, but the rechargeable battery did not last to my next birthday.  Given the small price tag, that may be common, but it was a little disappointing to find myself shopping for another one so soon.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose trimmer and I like this one.  The heads are a bit difficult to change but other than that it works well.  The eyebrow trimmer is nice, but if you are not used to using a beard trimmer with attachments I don&#x27;t recommend practicing on your brows as you can easily make a mistake that is very noticable.  The rechargeable function is nice and I have not had the problems with the base that I read in other reviews.  All in all a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Missing parts, and parts that do work, do so just okay. My trimmer arriaved missing one of the the attachment, and the one that did come is not that strong.  I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li> this product is ok in the way it performs when it is working, but mine stopped working within a few months. so i dont know bout the dependability n durability of this product.i had to start using my wahl beard n mustache trimmer now, the nose n ear attachment on it works great and has lasted a pretty long time now.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for the first few times I used it. Like most people I used it for a couple of minutes at a time, then again a few days later, etc. After about a month, which corresponded to less than 30 minutes total use, it spun to a halt. After recharging overnight, it worked for another few minutes, then stopped again. Clearly something malfunctioned with the motor and/or battery. Too cheap to return, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The nicest feature about the Wahl is that it is rechargeable, and lasts a good month on one charge. However, it is a trimmer and is okay at best when it comes to it&#x27;s one and only task. You need to really move it around to achieve a decent trim. Since no batteries are required you can spend the extra time needed to achieve this.</li>
            <li> BE ADVISED:  The storage base is NOT a recharging base (as is the case with, say, my Sonicare toothbrush).    Thus, you have to plug/unplug the charging cord connector from the bottom of this trimmer whenever you use this.  The other option is to leave it plugged in - meaning you&#x27;ll have lots of slack cord on your counter-top and the storage base will likely tip over when the cord catches on it - like it did for me this morning.    UPDATE:    I have lived with this item since August 17th and finally threw it out this evening.    My older Panasonic ER411 blows this trimmer out of the water in terms of trimming effectiveness.     For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer and a detailed oriented person.  This device simply doesn&#x27;t trim well and the base is essentially a useless piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that trims at a constant speed thanks to a rechargeable battery that&#x27;s always topped off, unlike 99% of the trimmers on the market that run on regular batteries which get weaker and weaker speed with every use and therefore tend to pull your hair instead of cutting it! Great idea, great product.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I tried the brow trimmer and it worked great.  I have a battery powered nose trimmer that I use, so it was a few days before I tried the nose trimmer.  First try and it locked up! I think the blade is bad.  I tried to call Wahl but they do not have a phone number so the other option is to send all of it to them. Guess I will just use the brow trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it. There are alot of different attachments and there are guides that say how long a charge will run for the amount of time on the charger</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it the best product in this category ( as I have experience of using others like Panasonic and Philips as well). Average at best! Cheap build is clearly visible.</li>
            <li> I wanted a rechargeable one because I&#x27;ve had the battery-powered cordless ones in the past.  They run out of juice while using, resulting in painful pulling of nose hair.  After about two months, one day while this was recharging it shorted out.  The handle melted and warped, and it stopped working.  I called the company because of the two year warranty, which was one of the reasons I chose this model.  They said I had to pay to send them the melted unit and all of the additional parts, and pay shipping for a replacement, which would have exceeded the original price tag.  I am just giving up on Wahl and rechargeable trimmers, and will find something better quality.  Maybe I&#x27;ll purchase the manual rotary trimmer instead.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and compact</li>
            <li> Worked amazing at first.  Initial charge lasted for 2-3 months and multiple uses.  After that the charge lasted for 1-2 uses.  Still works, but you need to charge it up after every use.  Edit:  Wahl offered to send me a new one and, that works pretty good, especially if you periodically clean it.  Now, unfortunately, I have lost the charging cord, so it is useless to me until I find it.  I swear I put it somewhere I wouldn&#x27;t lose it the last time it was charged, but I guess it was such a brilliant place I forgot where it was.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my husband who was getting out of control...it happens - hair on the ears, rogue eyebrows, trim mustache.  He loves having it.</li>
            <li> Trims nose hair fairly well. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUBBY FOR TRIMMING THOSE UNSIGHTLY HAIRS THAT HE DOESN&#x27;T SEE BUT EVERYONE ELSE DOES, AND BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS US WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM ASAP.  IT SEEMS THE OLDER YOU GET THE MORE HAIR GROWS IN THE WEIRDEST PLACES, IN YOUR NOSE, IN YOUR EARS, ON YOUR EARLOBES ON THE TIP OF YOU NOSE AND YES THOSE BUSHY EYEBROWS, AND FOR THESE TRIM JOBS THIS GROOMING TOOL IS IDEAL. OH, AND HUBBY LIKES IT TOO!!!! TRY ONE YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT FOR SURE. HAVE A BLESSED DAY TOO, DD</li>
            <li> This device is worthless.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge at all and doesn&#x27;t run while plugged in either.  So you have about 3 minutes of use on a full charge before it dies.  It&#x27;s very weak even when running.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> The nose trimming feature of this works great. I bought this particular trimmer because of the eyebrow trimming feature as well. The eyebrow trimming isn&#x27;t that great though. The attachment is really flimsy and kind of hacks up my eyebrows. I have really full eyebrows and am just looking to keep them under control. If I&#x27;m not careful, this thing will just shave them right off. But I at least have a nose trimmer, that I am happy about.</li>
            <li> This is great for the money.  He loves it.  I&#x27;ve even used it.  I stand is really not needed we just put everything in a zip bag.</li>
            <li> This device does the job I wanted for sometime, especially for taking care of the ears. I have been using Wahl hair clippers for several years, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate in buying this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a while, but after a few months it started to loose it&#x27;s speed ....I don&#x27;t believe that ts a battery related issue, but rather an issue with the head fitting/clipers</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money. Rechargable is nice but unit doesn&#x27;t cut as well as some cheaper ones I&#x27;ve tried. Going back to the Mangroomer, didn&#x27;t last but a couple months but worked great when used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently serving overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and this product was a lifesaver. I&#x27;m very conscious about my nose hair and this product came in handy. Shipping was no problem and arrived in tact. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who has pesky hair they need to keep under control.</li>
            <li> its great to have a nose and ear trimmer that charges who wants to add battiers all the time...I leave it plugged in never dies cuts well...dont use stand it comes with...just leave the other top next to it stand is junk but extremely satisfying product bought 6 more for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does all that it&#x27;s supposed to do with typical Wahl efficiency (I already use their hair clippers) but the stand needs improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all as it is currently designed it is a dust gatherer, pity it didn&#x27;t have some sort of lid, at least over the small components section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the cord needs somewhere to moor it firmly so it doesn&#x27;t have any play when the unit is connected or disconnected from charging.</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl battery powered trimmer, but this one seems to have a lot more power weather it&#x27;s plugged in or not.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> after using the panasonic version, and a few others with non-rechargeable batteries, I am convinced this one is the strongest and sharpest trimmer available. Well worth the price, which is not exactly expensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> Whal products excellent everything that i have owned in the past and present. This is the worst i have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great product works perfect. Better than expected. It is fast and the quality is real good. A must buy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this although I bought it a few years ago. The few times I&#x27;ve used it was to trim my nose hair and it trims my nose hair very clean and fast without hurting me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to groom themselves.</li>
            <li> one of the best in my opinion great price and does the job done fast and easy to use, glad i bought it</li>
            <li> Hopeless, below expectations and a nasty product. Wahl should refrain from even selling this product. Infact I dont have an option of giving it 1/2 a star. 1 star is a giant leap for Wahl</li>
            <li> Very affordable and it works very well..</li>
