            <li>Great product, hughly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li>I do like the heat protectant in this line, but wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo is great been using it for a year</li>
            <li>great arrived promptly</li>
            <li>AWESOME LOVE</li>
            <li>If you want something that packs away moisture, really brings out the healthy hair shine, and is best used when you hear style your hair, then this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Much better!</li>
            <li>Good results but would rather have a solution that is leave in since it may have more effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Most mosturizing conditioner, and I have tried 100s.</li>
            <li>After blow drying because this conditioner is heat activated, your hair is even more conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this product does it....</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I though was much better.</li>
            <li>Our Son is excited to get a bunch more.</li>
            <li>Quality is pretty good and shipping was fairly quick.</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo and Conditioner makes the hair really soft and shinny</li>
            <li>Love this product but the bottle is too small..</li>
            <li>you have fine hair, I would think that this conditioner would be too heavy</li>
            <li>I love kerastase prodcuts, but this was too heave for my hair, left it limp and oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, not any better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have dry fine hair and saw little difference when I used this compared to cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li>I buy this all the time for my hair because it helps a lot with my sensitive scalp and my dry itch</li>
            <li>would be better suited for someone with very thick dry hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is very dry, coarse and a frizz bomb.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and it makes my hair soft and manageable eat time.</li>
            <li> there are better products for less money on the market!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price though.. it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is too expensive and it does not bring much.</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit after the shower when my hair is damp, it&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again...</li>
            <li> I have wavy, coarser, thick hair which I treat with keratin to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> If you are going to try conditioners from this brand try Nutritive Masquintense Hair Thick Mask.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of product to work into my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> And I just thought it was so so for a product that is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it even...</li>

            <li> I buy this all the time for my hair because it helps a lot with my sensitive scalp and my dry itch</li>
            <li> Most mosturizing conditioner, and I have tried 100s. If you just want a lightweight detangler, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want something that packs away moisture, really brings out the healthy hair shine, and is best used when you hear style your hair, then this is perfect. After blow drying because this conditioner is heat activated, your hair is even more conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, I would think that this conditioner would be too heavy but I don&#x27;t know. I have wavy, coarser, thick hair which I treat with keratin to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and it makes my hair soft and manageable eat time.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great been using it for a year</li>
            <li> Bigger than we thought. Very happy with our purchase. Quality is pretty good and shipping was fairly quick. Our Son is excited to get a bunch more.</li>
            <li> It works ok. For the price though.. it&#x27;s not worth it. I have dry fine hair and saw little difference when I used this compared to cheaper conditioners. If you are going to try conditioners from this brand try Nutritive Masquintense Hair Thick Mask. Much better!</li>
            <li> AWESOME LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this.  I do like the heat protectant in this line, but wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the conditioner.  It took a lot of product to work into my thick hair.  And I just thought it was so so for a product that is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, not any better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, coarse and a frizz bomb.  This product has saved my life.  I use just a little bit after the shower when my hair is damp, it&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I love kerastase prodcuts, but this was too heave for my hair, left it limp and oily feeling. would be better suited for someone with very thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo and Conditioner makes the hair really soft and shinny</li>
            <li> great arrived promptly</li>
            <li> I bought it to protect my hair from heat and I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this product does it....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it but I don&#x27;t hate it even... I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again... there are better products for less money on the market!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love it...it has changed the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> I though was much better. It is too expensive and it does not bring much. As soon I finish with this product I will tried another one</li>
            <li> Good results but would rather have a solution that is leave in since it may have more effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Love this product but the bottle is too small..</li>
