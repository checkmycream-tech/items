            <li>This brush is a great alternative to the clarisonic and it does oscillate.</li>

            <li>For all intensive purposes though, after using both sonic cleansers I have to say the Nutra Sonic was on par with the Clarisonic Mia performance wise.</li>

            <li>I was very excited to receive and use this product....</li>
            <li>Still, not bad for a handsome hunk of 70!  </li>
            <li>oh, and one small square of good chocolate for dessert, my skin is good for another 40 years!    </li>
            <li>and I find it every bit as strong as the Calisonic I have used in the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Also it really is true that when you use these sonic brushes your creams and lotions seem to penetrate your skin better.</li>

            <li>Thanks for making such a great product!!</li>
            <li>My skin not only looks better than it ever has, but it feels better as well!</li>
            <li>I was originally stuck on a rotating brush, but I was growing to like the performance of the vibrating Nutra Sonic.  </li>
            <li>I may be in need of replacing mine soon, but for the amount of use it gets I think it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I called and it seemed like the more I wanted a clear answer,the more the dear girl on the phone retreated into her accent.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in my skin after the very first use.</li>
            <li>It most certainly improves my skin.  </li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d add this note because I was looking through my reviews and thought a final word,18 months later,would be a good idea.</li>

            <li>Love how gentle it is on my face.</li>
            <li>So the results are not bad.</li>
            <li>Funny thing is I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, as I&#x27;ve still been trying to figure out which one I liked most.  </li>
            <li>a little&#x27;s good, more&#x27;s better\\&quot; temptation.  </li>
            <li>To be honest the Nutra Sonic comes in a cheap, generic looking box..</li>
            <li>I really was expecting something that looked and felt cheap.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money  </li>
            <li>I own the larger Nutra Sonic and this one for travel.  </li>
            <li>Do not hesitate to get this, brush is soft enough for my sensitive skin to use twice a day great for blackheads and acne and aging as it helps your products absorb much better.</li>
            <li>I know that the Clarisonic has many different brush heads available</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an effective product but the difficulty in getting replacement brush heads and future product support are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>holds a charge better than the big C brand too</li>
            <li>This rechargeable facial cleaner device is small yet still perfect for \\&quot;meat hook-sized\\&quot; hands.  </li>
            <li>but the charger got so hot that over time, it burned a hole through the on-button.</li>
            <li>After each use I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>I wanted to know what justified the near $100 difference.</li>
            <li>Also worth noting, the Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head has bristles sparsely dispersed versus the Nutra Sonic that has has bristles very densely packed together.</li>
            <li>Not that it has been too harsh using the \\&quot;normal\\&quot;skin brush,but I&#x27;d rather under-do things and get good results,than maybe do things too much(for</li>
            <li>just the time it took for the brand new battery to get enough juice to light the light)but the light that comes on and is supposed to blink when it&#x27;s charging,came on,and THIS ONE started blinking.</li>

            <li>One thing a friend of mine told me a long time ago was to make sure you charge things like this for 48 hours, not what they tell you or what the package says.  </li>

            <li>I tried charging it last night and the light came on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere, in the ad or even in the owner&#x27;s manual, that the regular brushes don&#x27;t fit the travel size.  </li>
            <li>I can tell this really cleans my face of all traces of make-up, oil and dirt.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have any cleansers</li>
            <li>My skin stayed this way much, much longer when I use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Nutra Sonic could really benefit from a travel protector for the brushes or the whole unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Nutra Sonic could really benefit from a travel protector for the brushes or the whole unit.</li>
            <li>After only seeing one kind of NutraSonic replacement brushes all over the internet, I thought the brushes must be universal.  </li>
            <li>A little product I use every day...hold charge for a long time been great for my face and and neck...</li>
            <li>The results are greatly apparent from the very first use.  </li>
            <li>The plan was to keep the one I like most, and return the other one.  </li>
            <li>It is great device other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t last as long as one would expect considering that it&#x27;s not as cheap as other ones available.</li>
            <li>Well, after 8 days and a single charge, the Pretika is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>it gets my skin super soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon took it back as a return with no hassle.  </li>
            <li>Getting older now</li>
            <li>This sonic brush has 2 speed settings and I use mine on high.</li>
            <li>The Nutra Sonic cleans out the pores and rough patches feel smooth... and make me look 20.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by how much it costs here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As long as the product works well and charges properly it most likely delivers and does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li>but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li>It pops into a little matching blue charger, however it pops in facing backward and you won&#x27;t be able to see the blinking red light by the on button unless you turn it around.</li>
            <li>For only $50 when clarisonics are several times that much - this is a steal!!!</li>
            <li>It came with two brushes - 1 for sensitive skin and 1 for normal skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is also getting drier and less smooth</li>
            <li>If I had known that, I would have never purchased this item, much less threw away another $22 on extra brushes that don&#x27;t fit!      </li>
            <li>Just received my second Nitra Sonic and I now know for certain</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic has a much larger brushhead and handle and does look and feel a little more professional than the Nutra Sonic.</li>
            <li>I do tend to use products made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But I know the fat in meat was showing up directly on my face,because I could tell if I ate meat,as a vegetarian,my face would become oily.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell there is no product-defect.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell there is no product-defect.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>When the unit worked, I have no complaints about its cleansing action.  </li>
            <li>The flimsy pouch doesn&#x27;t do much to protect the bristles of the brush and mine actually came with some of the bristles bent backwards on the brush.</li>
            <li>The flimsy pouch doesn&#x27;t do much to protect the bristles of the brush and mine actually came with some of the bristles bent backwards on the brush.</li>
            <li>I can usually use this once to twice a day for almost two weeks before I feel the power isn&#x27;t as strong as it should be.  </li>
            <li>Keep it down to a mild roar.  </li>
            <li>Its battery free and cordless unlike alot of cleaning tools and it oscillates and doesn&#x27;t rotate like the clairsonic and unlike cheaper brands, will not rub you raw</li>
            <li>It also comes with a small instruction pamphlet and a cheap pouch (even cheaper than the one in stock photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried taking off and putting the head back on, switching to a new head, and still nothing.  </li>
            <li>It does not DRY OUT the skin but leaves it soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>at times,ate meat(a complicated reason,I thought I needed it for the nutrients,what I really needed was MORE Calories,which,when I realized it was a calorie,and not a nutrition issue I was having,I made up for just by using extra olive oil.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is significantly less powerful with only one speed and feels equivalent to the Nutra Sonic at low speed.</li>
            <li>That lotion was also greasy and would take time to get absorbed (it was shiny and made makeup application look heavy!).</li>
            <li>The outside bristles move normally, but the center bristles remain pretty still, only moving a little.  </li>
            <li>I use it occasionally because I think the biggest benefit my skin got from this was initially,in the first few months,when the brush got into the pores and removed built up and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long before even rather healthy, tough skin CAN be gently \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; until it is sandpapered raw.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately she needed a new one and this was the only place I could find it at about the same price I had originally bought it at.  </li>

            <li> I called and it seemed like the more I wanted a clear answer,the more the dear girl on the phone retreated into her accent.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in my skin after the very first use.</li>
            <li> It most certainly improves my skin.  </li>

            <li> Love how gentle it is on my face.</li>
            <li> So the results are not bad.</li>
            <li> Funny thing is I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, as I&#x27;ve still been trying to figure out which one I liked most.  </li>
            <li> a little&#x27;s good, more&#x27;s better\\&quot; temptation.  </li>
            <li> To be honest the Nutra Sonic comes in a cheap, generic looking box..</li>
            <li> I really was expecting something that looked and felt cheap.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money  </li>
            <li> I own the larger Nutra Sonic and this one for travel.  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to get this, brush is soft enough for my sensitive skin to use twice a day great for blackheads and acne and aging as it helps your products absorb much better.</li>
            <li> I know that the Clarisonic has many different brush heads available</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an effective product but the difficulty in getting replacement brush heads and future product support are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but the charger got so hot that over time, it burned a hole through the on-button.</li>
            <li> After each use I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> I wanted to know what justified the near $100 difference.</li>
            <li> Also worth noting, the Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head has bristles sparsely dispersed versus the Nutra Sonic that has has bristles very densely packed together.</li>
            <li> Not that it has been too harsh using the \\&quot;normal\\&quot;skin brush,but I&#x27;d rather under-do things and get good results,than maybe do things too much(for</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere, in the ad or even in the owner&#x27;s manual, that the regular brushes don&#x27;t fit the travel size.  </li>
            <li> I can tell this really cleans my face of all traces of make-up, oil and dirt.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The Nutra Sonic could really benefit from a travel protector for the brushes or the whole unit.</li>
            <li> After only seeing one kind of NutraSonic replacement brushes all over the internet, I thought the brushes must be universal.  </li>
            <li> A little product I use every day...hold charge for a long time been great for my face and and neck...</li>
            <li> The results are greatly apparent from the very first use.  </li>
            <li> The plan was to keep the one I like most, and return the other one.  </li>
            <li> It is great device other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t last as long as one would expect considering that it&#x27;s not as cheap as other ones available.</li>
            <li> Well, after 8 days and a single charge, the Pretika is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> it gets my skin super soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Luckily, Amazon took it back as a return with no hassle.  </li>
            <li> Getting older now</li>
            <li> This sonic brush has 2 speed settings and I use mine on high.</li>
            <li> The Nutra Sonic cleans out the pores and rough patches feel smooth... and make me look 20.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how much it costs here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As long as the product works well and charges properly it most likely delivers and does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li> but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li> It pops into a little matching blue charger, however it pops in facing backward and you won&#x27;t be able to see the blinking red light by the on button unless you turn it around.</li>
            <li> For only $50 when clarisonics are several times that much - this is a steal!!!</li>
            <li> It came with two brushes - 1 for sensitive skin and 1 for normal skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is also getting drier and less smooth</li>
            <li> If I had known that, I would have never purchased this item, much less threw away another $22 on extra brushes that don&#x27;t fit!      </li>
            <li> Just received my second Nitra Sonic and I now know for certain</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic has a much larger brushhead and handle and does look and feel a little more professional than the Nutra Sonic.</li>
            <li> I do tend to use products made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I know the fat in meat was showing up directly on my face,because I could tell if I ate meat,as a vegetarian,my face would become oily.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell there is no product-defect.</li>

            <li> When the unit worked, I have no complaints about its cleansing action.  </li>
            <li> The flimsy pouch doesn&#x27;t do much to protect the bristles of the brush and mine actually came with some of the bristles bent backwards on the brush.</li>

            <li> I can usually use this once to twice a day for almost two weeks before I feel the power isn&#x27;t as strong as it should be.  </li>
            <li> Keep it down to a mild roar.  </li>
            <li> Its battery free and cordless unlike alot of cleaning tools and it oscillates and doesn&#x27;t rotate like the clairsonic and unlike cheaper brands, will not rub you raw</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small instruction pamphlet and a cheap pouch (even cheaper than the one in stock photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried taking off and putting the head back on, switching to a new head, and still nothing.  </li>

            <li> The Clarisonic is significantly less powerful with only one speed and feels equivalent to the Nutra Sonic at low speed.</li>
            <li> That lotion was also greasy and would take time to get absorbed (it was shiny and made makeup application look heavy!).</li>
            <li> The outside bristles move normally, but the center bristles remain pretty still, only moving a little.  </li>
            <li> I use it occasionally because I think the biggest benefit my skin got from this was initially,in the first few months,when the brush got into the pores and removed built up and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long before even rather healthy, tough skin CAN be gently \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; until it is sandpapered raw.  </li>

            <li> I did buy another brand that was on sale at one point and a little cheaper, but it didn&#x27;t do nearly as well as this travel size.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very excited to receive and use this product....I even had it shipped overnight. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and.....NOTHING! It didn&#x27;t even start charging. What a complete waste of money and time. This is a HUGE disappointment. Forget this brand.</li>
            <li> Lived up to my expectations---------yeah---</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better!  I bought for 2 friends and it works great for them too!  For only $50 when clarisonics are several times that much - this is a steal!!!</li>
            <li> To be fair,I saw this item in an ad from a nearby store. I thought I might get it here,but I read the reviews and thought it would be easier to just drive it over and return it...If it charges the right way(it said the light would blink when it charges,so far,no blinking. I called and it seemed like the more I wanted a clear answer,the more the dear girl on the phone retreated into her accent. I wanted an answer,she didn&#x27;t exactly give me one.)But in just one use I noticed a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t use scrubs or exfoliate or have any skin issues...just regular wash and moisturize and treat it with some respect over 40 (cough cough)skin. So the results are not bad. The literature has replacement brushes pictured,I assume you can order them. As long as the product works well and charges properly it most likely delivers and does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review part II - as far as I can tell nothing is wrong with this product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times,had it about. Week(usually if a product is defective it shows in a short time).I don&#x27;t know why there are such bad reviews for it,unless they just didn&#x27;t charge it or gunked-up the brushes by not rinsing it very well. Because I don&#x27;t exfoliate(but for the occasional face scrub and vegan mud mask),I found from years of gentle treatment,I must have had an almost invisible\\&quot;shell\\&quot; (micro-layers of product/dead skin cells) of something,or maybe it is the fact that the bristles really do get INto your pores and clean them. Maybe it&#x27;s partly the brush massaging-in the Beauty Without Cruelty Moisturizing facial cleanser(also in reviewed here,by Vegan Virgo(me)in the product reviews )or the fact that invisible layers of dead skin cells(or whatever)were sloughed off,but my face feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt,(not that it was rough before)and also I can feel things on my face when the skin is touched,much more acutely;another thing that tells me I must have had an invisible build up of stuff covering the skin of my face. For people who exfoliate and buff (and sandblast,or the facial equivalent of it)I don&#x27;t think this product will have the same effect on buffed and over-processed(or already otherwise exfoliated)skin. I always infrequently use a scrub because they&#x27;re too intense for my tastes,and too drying. I almost got Biore strips but didn&#x27;t because it had a warning about skin-fragility,I&#x27;ve used wax strips for light hair/brow treatments and had the skin tear a little,so it looked like Biore strips would also do that. But this NutraSonic product has got to those clogged pores on the nose,and also,i see a difference. I have used it three times,I don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;over-do-it\\&quot; by using it too much,for my skin. Maybe the softer brush would be better. Not that it has been too harsh using the \\&quot;normal\\&quot;skin brush,but I&#x27;d rather under-do things and get good results,than maybe do things too much(for my skin)and over-work it and dry it out. I don&#x27;t have a too-delicate or sensitive/fragile skin,but it doesn&#x27;t respond well to being abused,either. I do tend to use products made for sensitive skin. I have a normal/to dry skin type,definitely not oily. When I ate meat my skin was an oily skin,and I know for a fact the meat was causing it(or the fat in the meat)I was a vegetarian for 20 years before I became vegan,and at times,ate meat(a complicated reason,I thought I needed it for the nutrients,what I really needed was MORE Calories,which,when I realized it was a calorie,and not a nutrition issue I was having,I made up for just by using extra olive oil. Problem solved. But I know the fat in meat was showing up directly on my face,because I could tell if I ate meat,as a vegetarian,my face would become oily. I added that for anyone who might have oily skin problems(oily skin also can attract bacteria and be prone to skin eruptions or a \\&quot;problem complexion\\&quot;. In Canada I heard they can test your cholesterol levels by doing a wipe of the skin on your face and analyzing it,and cholesterol is found onlyin products(milk-products;butter,cheese,etc; eggs and meat,etc.)that come from animals. Skin problems,or certain types of skin problems associated with oily skin might be caused by meat/meat fat in the diet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is an\\&quot;over-forty-skin.(Cough cough)\\&quot; - I just don&#x27;t say how much over forty;)&lt;br /&gt;I gave five stars because it does,I think,what it says it does. As far as I can tell there is no product-defect. But while making your skin look younger,it doesn&#x27;t exactly make your face look like a teenager&#x27;s again.*sigh* Oh well. You can&#x27;t have everything. I guess this is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Part III - it is 23 days since I bought this product. I tried charging it last night and the light came on. But it was never charged. I exchanged it for another one today. It took a little fiddling around(or just the time it took for the brand new battery to get enough juice to light the light)but the light that comes on and is supposed to blink when it&#x27;s charging,came on,and THIS ONE started blinking. The other one did not blink at any time,and was charged somewhat when I took it out of the box. I used that one about 5 times,and finally,last night,it didn&#x27;t charge,even though the light came on. Because there are some good reviews of this product,and because of the results I got,I still think it is a good product. But,I would say,if you get one that would charge but not blink when it is charging,it will probably give you problems or stop working. I&#x27;m charging this one for the first charge,which is 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Part Four(today is September 2,2013) I still have this and it still works fine. If it sits unused the battery apparently loses the charge and it needs to be charged before you can use it,but aside from that there are no \\&quot;issues\\&quot; with it. I use it occasionally because I think the biggest benefit my skin got from this was initially,in the first few months,when the brush got into the pores and removed built up and invisible dead skin cells/\\&quot;gunk\\&quot;/and etc. I still use it occasionally but need to recharge it before use when it has sat unused for quite awhile(months) but I think that is normal. Batteries lose their charge over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d add this note because I was looking through my reviews and thought a final word,18 months later,would be a good idea. I suppose the bad reviews came from people who apparently got a defective item or they didn&#x27;t charge it the right way,and were unwilling to give it a chance. The first one I bought had a charging issue and I exchanged it for another one,and have had no problems with it.in products(milk-products;butter,cheese,etc; eggs and meat,etc.)that come from animals. Skin problems,or certain types of skin problems associated with oily skin might be caused by meat/meat fat in the diet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is an\\&quot;over-forty-skin.(Cough cough)\\&quot; - I just don&#x27;t say how much over forty;)&lt;br /&gt;I gave five stars because it does,I think,what it says it does. As far as I can tell there is no product-defect. But while making your skin look younger,it doesn&#x27;t exactly make your face look like a teenager&#x27;s again.*sigh* Oh well. You can&#x27;t have everything. I guess this is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Part III - it is 23 days since I bought this product. I tried charging it last night and the light came on. But it was never charged. I exchanged it for another one today. It took a little fiddling around(or just the time it took for the brand new battery to get enough juice to light the light)but the light that comes on and is supposed to blink when it&#x27;s charging,came on,and THIS ONE started blinking. The other one did not blink at any time,and was charged somewhat when I took it out of the box. I used that one about 5 times,and finally,last night,it didn&#x27;t charge,even though the light came on. Because there are some good reviews of this product,and because of the results I got,I still think it is a good product. But,I would say,if you get one that would charge but not blink when it is charging,it will probably give you problems or stop working. I&#x27;m charging this one for the first charge,which is 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Part Four(today is September 2,2013) I still have this and it still works fine. If it sits unused the battery apparently loses the charge and it needs to be charged before you can use it,but aside from that there are no \\&quot;issues\\&quot; with it. I use it occasionally because I think the biggest benefit my skin got from this was initially,in the first few months,when the brush got into the pores and removed built up and invisible dead skincells/\\&quot;gunk\\&quot;/and etc. I still use it occasionally but need to recharge it before use when it has sat unused for quite awhile(months) but I think that is normal. Batteries lose their charge over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d add this note because I was looking through my reviews and thought a final word,18 months later,would be a good idea.

            <li> Feels just like the Clarisonic at a fraction of the price! I have noticed cleaner, clearer skin in the week I have been using it. Some drying, but I think my skin will adjust. I&#x27;d rather use a moisturizer than be broken out all summer anyway!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost one month, and while my face is smoother, it isn&#x27;t clearer.  But that can just be my choice in product.  I haven&#x27;t had any of the charging problems others seem to have, but I have had trouble starting these past few days where the center doesn&#x27;t vibrate.  The outside bristles move normally, but the center bristles remain pretty still, only moving a little.  I&#x27;ve tried taking off and putting the head back on, switching to a new head, and still nothing.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month and already it seems worn out.</li>
            <li> cheaper than the big C-brand brush  definitely worth the money  holds a charge better than the big C brand too</li>
            <li> I bought this item about a month ago.  I worked great, but then needed to replace the brush.  After only seeing one kind of NutraSonic replacement brushes all over the internet, I thought the brushes must be universal.  Well that&#x27;s what I get for thinking!      I ordered 2 replacement brushes and when they arrived, they were way too big.  Another $22 down the drain.  It&#x27;s not like I can return them.  Then I come to find out they don&#x27;t even make replacement brushes in the travel size!  WOW...what a waste!  It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere, in the ad or even in the owner&#x27;s manual, that the regular brushes don&#x27;t fit the travel size.  That&#x27;s pretty shady for NutraSonic to not disclose this info to a buyer.  If I had known that, I would have never purchased this item, much less threw away another $22 on extra brushes that don&#x27;t fit!      Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item or give it to this shady company.  I&#x27;m done!  Clairsonic, here I come!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a gift for my sister. It worked great and is an excellent price! I was reading one of the earlier reviews and noticed that item didn&#x27;t charge. This is simply user error as you need to look at the picture and position the item in the correct direction in the cradle. My sister loves this product at home and on the road based on it&#x27;s size!</li>
            <li> I own the larger Nutra Sonic and this one for travel.  While the larger one&#x27;s brush does rotate, this one only vibrates.  While I prefer my larger one that rotates, I have found this one works quite well for travel.  It&#x27;s more compact when luggage space is at a premium. I have not had any problems with it keeping a charge.  One thing a friend of mine told me a long time ago was to make sure you charge things like this for 48 hours, not what they tell you or what the package says.  This has served me well from cordless phones to products like this. I can usually use this once to twice a day for almost two weeks before I feel the power isn&#x27;t as strong as it should be.  I can tell this really cleans my face of all traces of make-up, oil and dirt.  I did buy another brand that was on sale at one point and a little cheaper, but it didn&#x27;t do nearly as well as this travel size.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my sister a couple of years ago for Christmas and she love it! Unfortunately she needed a new one and this was the only place I could find it at about the same price I had originally bought it at.  Once again, she is in love!! Thanks for making such a great product!!</li>
            <li> A little product I use every day...hold charge for a long time been great for my face and and neck...if you don&#x27;t have one you should get one...</li>
            <li> This rechargeable facial cleaner device is small yet still perfect for \\&quot;meat hook-sized\\&quot; hands.  Being male, I ordered the blue one.  I have oily skin.  And, I use Dial liquid exfoliating body wash (with the \\&quot;beads.\\&quot;)  It does not DRY OUT the skin but leaves it soft and supple.  Yes, MEN need that too.  The results are greatly apparent from the very first use.  I suggest one resist the \\&quot;if a little&#x27;s good, more&#x27;s better\\&quot; temptation.  Keep it down to a mild roar.  It doesn&#x27;t take long before even rather healthy, tough skin CAN be gently \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; until it is sandpapered raw.  Used in moderation, this device is a wonder.    Now at age 70, I had hoped my teenage clogged pores would be decades gone.  Nope.  Though no longer having infected pimples/pustules spring up, patches of sebum-clogged pores actually feel \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; to the touch.  The Nutra Sonic cleans out the pores and rough patches feel smooth... and make me look 20.  Well, okay, a healthy 45 then.  Still, not bad for a handsome hunk of 70!  :)    The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is apprehension.  This is my second device.  The internal rechargeable battery is not replaceable. And, it seems to have a limited life.  It&#x27;s longer than any warranty... but buying a whole new device is expensive every 13-14 months.    Using the Nutra Sonic, combined with a glass of wine at dinner (taken internally,) ... oh, and one small square of good chocolate for dessert, my skin is good for another 40 years!    Six Month Follow-Up...    Still working great.  I suspect some reviewers who have issues of device not taking a second charge are not placing the device correctly into the charger.  It faces BACKWARDS... which looks wrong.  Mine won&#x27;t recharge either... until placed in recharger cradle the correct way.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for several years and I find it every bit as strong as the Calisonic I have used in the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  It most certainly improves my skin.  Even the woman who does my facial every few months notices the difference.I am considering getting a second one for the downstairs bath.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great alternative to the clarisonic and it does oscillate. It lasted about a year and a half but the charger got so hot that over time, it burned a hole through the on-button. With the hole there, it is not usable. The brushes are a bit firmer than clarisonic so I used it a couple times per week instead of daily. It is great device other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t last as long as one would expect considering that it&#x27;s not as cheap as other ones available.</li>
            <li> Does not charge!  I left it on the charger over night, tried moving it around to get a connection, used different outlets... there is no flashing light...nothing :/</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to get this, brush is soft enough for my sensitive skin to use twice a day great for blackheads and acne and aging as it helps your products absorb much better. Its battery free and cordless unlike alot of cleaning tools and it oscillates and doesn&#x27;t rotate like the clairsonic and unlike cheaper brands, will not rub you raw</li>
            <li> like it... softer bristles than clarisonic, which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I love this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!  My skin not only looks better than it ever has, but it feels better as well!</li>
            <li> When the unit worked, I have no complaints about its cleansing action.  I also own a Clarisonic Mia and find it comparable.  However, it only worked for 3 uses.  Tried to use it a 4th time and it was dead. I thought maybe I had not replaced in correctly in the charger, but could not get it to make a connection.  Even tried a different outlet and to no avail. Luckily, Amazon took it back as a return with no hassle.  It may be 1/2 the price of the Mia, but if it doesn&#x27;t work after 3 days, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Was concerned after reading reviews, however I followed the instructions and it works great! Love how gentle it is on my face.</li>
            <li> does the jib . Rinse it off and see the dirt wash off. Cleans well.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this device. I tried a less expensive product in between and my face broke out and looked aged. Just received my second Nitra Sonic and I now know for certain it is the most important part of my cleansing process!</li>
            <li> love this brush. it gets my skin super soft and clear. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion brush on the same day. The Pretika rotates, the Nutra Sonic vibrates.  The plan was to keep the one I like most, and return the other one.  Well, after 8 days and a single charge, the Pretika is still going strong.  The Nutra Sonic just died, and it will not take a charge.  Funny thing is I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, as I&#x27;ve still been trying to figure out which one I liked most.  They both do a great job of cleaning my skin, but I&#x27;ve found myself using the Pretika more.  I was originally stuck on a rotating brush, but I was growing to like the performance of the vibrating Nutra Sonic.  I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower.  What gives?  I read all of the other reviews that state similar issues.  Now I&#x27;m adding mine.  I bought this product from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow.  I may exchange it for another one, just to see if it does the same thing.  If I do, I will write an update to this review.  But for now, I&#x27;m chalking it up as a dud.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it everyday. I am currently on my second one in 4 yrs. I find that they have about a 2 yr lifespan.  I may be in need of replacing mine soon, but for the amount of use it gets I think it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how much it costs here on Amazon. I purchased for half the price in store at Bed Bath and Beyond and got another additional 20% off with the coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this sonic cleanser. I noticed a huge difference in my skin after the very first use. I actually don&#x27;t use any cleansers on my face on a regular basis. Washing my face on a regular basis results in break outs for me. (Go figure!) I&#x27;ve never had acne problems, just an occasional blemish once in a blue moon. I literally use only water and a washcloth unless I have makeup on which is the only time I use cleanser. Getting older now and I&#x27;m starting to notice that I have sun spots on skin and the beginning signs of wrinkles. My skin is also getting drier and less smooth so I decided it was time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been researching for some time and saw this at a great price so I decided to try. I was eyeing the Clarisonic but hesitated due to how expensive it was. To be honest the Nutra Sonic comes in a cheap, generic looking box..the sort of product that looks like an \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; item. I&#x27;ve never even heard of this company (Nutra Luxe MD) before. However upon opening the box I was impressed by the quality of the cleanser. I really was expecting something that looked and felt cheap. The powder blue handle is rubberized all around and is waterproof. It came with two brushes - 1 for sensitive skin and 1 for normal skin. The handle is compact and fits nicely in my hand. It pops into a little matching blue charger, however it pops in facing backward and you won&#x27;t be able to see the blinking red light by the on button unless you turn it around. It also comes with a small instruction pamphlet and a cheap pouch (even cheaper than the one in stock photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have any cleansers so I just purchased some Noxema cold cream, slopped it on the sonic brush and went at it. I used circular motions on my face and probably went for about 2 minutes total and rinsed. This sonic brush has 2 speed settings and I use mine on high. After each use I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my skin was. My skin stayed this way much, much longer when I use this. The rough spots on my face went away and within a week there was a noticeable difference in the clarity of my skin. It was brighter and people noticed...my husband thought I had makeup on when in fact I had none. Also it really is true that when you use these sonic brushes your creams and lotions seem to penetrate your skin better. I had a lotion that I would put on before makeup because my skin was so dry. That lotion was also greasy and would take time to get absorbed (it was shiny and made makeup application look heavy!). After using this sonic cleanser there was a noticeable difference in how my skin took the lotion..it didn&#x27;t feel like it was just sitting on the surface of my skin anymore. My makeup is also going on much more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison with Clarisonic Mia (one speed):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased the Clarisonic anyway for comparison. I wanted to know what justified the near $100 difference. The Clarisonic has a much larger brushhead and handle and does look and feel a little more professional than the Nutra Sonic. The Clarisonic is significantly less powerful with only one speed and feels equivalent to the Nutra Sonic at low speed. The Nutra Sonic feels stronger and vibrates much more. I do know that some of the Clarisonic brushes have rings that independently vibrate and rotate, creating a massage like cleaning motion on skin. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t tell if the Nutra Sonic does the same (very vague info). For all intensive purposes though, after using both sonic cleansers I have to say the Nutra Sonic was on par with the Clarisonic Mia performance wise. Also worth noting, the Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head has bristles sparsely dispersed versus the Nutra Sonic that has has bristles very densely packed together. I know that the Clarisonic has many different brush heads available but I&#x27;m just going to review what&#x27;s right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nutra Sonic could really benefit from a travel protector for the brushes or the whole unit. The flimsy pouch doesn&#x27;t do much to protect the bristles of the brush and mine actually came with some of the bristles bent backwards on the brush. (Coincidentally the Clarisonic Mia also didn&#x27;t come with any travel container other than a brush cap which does at least help.) I also think it&#x27;s interesting that this Nutra Sonic skin cleanser is NOT advertised on the Nutra Luxe website. As a matter of fact the website currently doesn&#x27;t advertise any of their sonic cleansers. That&#x27;s a huge concern because brush heads are going to be difficult to replace. I know they exist since the part numbers are listed on the little manual in the box. But it does make one wonder why they are not even promoting their own product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an effective product but the difficulty in getting replacement brush heads and future product support are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/18/13: Went back to Bed Bath Beyond and returned. When I told the cashier that I was concerned about the product being discontinued, she was pretty disappointed (she owned one too and loved it!). So she looked in the computer system and confirmed that this product has been discontinued by the company. So now we have confirmation of that. :(y densely packed together.
