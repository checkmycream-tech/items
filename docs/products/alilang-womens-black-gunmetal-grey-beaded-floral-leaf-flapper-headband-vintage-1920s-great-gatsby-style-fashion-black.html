            <li>It&#x27;s cute, comfortable, goes with nearly everything, and great for going out, going to work, or just every day wear.</li>
            <li>beautiful accessory for my 1920&#x27;s-themed  event, but definitely not limited for using elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It looks absolutely beautiful on short hair.</li>
            <li>My dress is black with silver accents, so this headband was a perfect buy!</li>
            <li>Works well with my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and suits the theme I wanted, but I can also use it for every day wear!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;band&#x27; part of it isn&#x27;t the greatest material but not super &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a Great Gatsby themed birthday party but ended up wearing it on the regular.</li>
            <li>It worked awesome for prom but after a few hours it hurt my head</li>
            <li>A Great value for the price and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Super light weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flapper-esque, and it is also very comfortable.</li>
            <li>You can tell its of good quality and elegant looking: I would wear to other formal events.</li>
            <li>but I was able to wear it for the whole night anyway.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>was very pretty as a part of my 1920&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected will work great for what I need it for</li>
            <li>Nice design for a special day and not to over the top for a everyday look.</li>
            <li>Its very classy and elegant and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Very cute with my new short pixie cut.</li>
            <li>Really sparkly!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price; much nicer than the headbands I saw at the mall for $15</li>
            <li>This looks exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>It was a big hit and absolutely adorable.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted to go with my flapper outfit for this murder mystery train</li>
            <li>Even better, the band fits my extra large head.</li>
            <li>and I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>The beaded design was placed more towards the top of the headband rather than more towards the side like in the picture, which was a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and festive.</li>
            <li>A very well made accessory.</li>
            <li>It seems to be that the beads are attached to the band very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but as would be with any metal headband, inevitably uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I find myself wearing it to dress up any outfit on more than a few occasions now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and it doesn&#x27;t slip - the only thing is if you wear it a long time it does tend to dig into your head a bit.</li>
            <li>Looks good with blonde, red or dark hair.</li>
            <li>A very classy and dressy piece.</li>
            <li>So classy looking!</li>
            <li>It was pretty enough</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was too dark first.  </li>
            <li>This looks much more expensive and classy then the sequined and feather headbands that they offer online.</li>
            <li>Went well with flapper dress purchased for early 20th century musical review.</li>

            <li> So classy looking!</li>
            <li> It was pretty enough</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was too dark first.  </li>
            <li> This looks much more expensive and classy then the sequined and feather headbands that they offer online.</li>
            <li> Went well with flapper dress purchased for early 20th century musical review.</li>
            <li> A little tight on my head so had to take it off after a few hrs, but otherwise looked really cute and got lots of complements.</li>
            <li> exactly as shown, lightweight, feels a bit delicate but not issues with quality.</li>
            <li> Womanly, flirty, as opposed to looking like a little girl with a big bow on your head.</li>
            <li> Plus, the felt lining protects hair from snags, but depending on your head size, it may be a tad too loose for some.</li>
            <li> , I paired it with a silver and gold dress with patterns made of sequins, and the other person paired it with a simple black dress.</li>
            <li> Nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> A touch of elegance to be dressed up or down.</li>
            <li> Not to tight or lose.</li>
            <li> A little small for me</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit behind the ears</li>
            <li> The metal head band started to rub wrong after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> so sad</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a headpiece for a Roarin&#x27; 20s party, this might be a bit lame.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really sparkly! I wore it to a &#x27;20s themed murder mystery party and I find myself wearing it to dress up any outfit on more than a few occasions now. Really cute!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a themed outfit and it worked well. Can also wear for a dressy event. Cute and well made.</li>
            <li> I love this piece! I got for a 20&#x27;s themed party, and it was perfect. Great fit, comfortable, and beautiful, I even forgot I had it on. Super light weight.</li>
            <li> This looks much more expensive and classy then the sequined and feather headbands that they offer online. This adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Adorable! Absolutely adorable! I wore it to a Great Gatsby themed party and it got rave reviews. It looked perfect in my hair, and apparently another party attendee agreed - she showed up with the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the party, I paired it with a silver and gold dress with patterns made of sequins, and the other person paired it with a simple black dress. It paired well with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I bought this for a party, I am confident that I can find an occasion in which to wear it again. It&#x27;s beautiful and does not look like a costume piece.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly very comfortable. Forgot I was even wearing it. The beaded design was placed more towards the top of the headband rather than more towards the side like in the picture, which was a disappointment. Even still, it worked well with my flapper costume.</li>
            <li> The bead work on this is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little more comfortable to wear. The metal head band started to rub wrong after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Super cute. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and doesn&#x27;t slip. Then ends have cloth so it doesn&#x27;t jab the back of your ear</li>
            <li> This matched perfectly to my 1920&#x27;s themed wedding &amp;mother-of-the-bride dress...loved it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a party and have worn this several times. I have received many compliments. Very sparkly and festive.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Very cute with my new short pixie cut. I received many compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> This was beautiful! So classy looking!</li>
            <li> Very pretty but the ribbon is falling off the metal headband. It arrived that way. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but as would be with any metal headband, inevitably uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It matched great with my flapper girl outfit for my friends party.  My friends thought it was beautiful and very cute!  The &#x27;band&#x27; part of it isn&#x27;t the greatest material but not super &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  The design part of it made up for it and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price; much nicer than the headbands I saw at the mall for $15+.  I could even use it again on a night out.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and stylish.</li>
            <li> Nice just as pictured.</li>
            <li> I loved this, but my dog ate it.  so sad</li>
            <li> A very well made accessory. Color is neutral and can be worn with a lot of shades. Glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and it doesn&#x27;t slip - the only thing is if you wear it a long time it does tend to dig into your head a bit.</li>
            <li> Playful &amp; elegant. A nod to the 1920s with just enough shimmer &amp;  sass.  Plus, the felt lining protects hair from snags, but depending on your head size, it may be a tad too loose for some.</li>
            <li> Love it. It looks absolutely beautiful on short hair.</li>
            <li> Nicer than I expected. Got it for a 20&#x27;s party ~ but this is so nice can where it  for formal wear.  Adorable</li>
            <li> Beautiful headband and well made. Wearing it to a Great Gatsby dinner. Should be perfect a perfect addition to my dress.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Great Gatsby themed birthday party but ended up wearing it on the regular. It is very comfortable and fits my head well. I have gotten many compliments!</li>
            <li> I bought this headband with the purpose of using it for a new year&#x27;s eve party with The Great Gatsby theme! I love it! It arrived quickly and suits the theme I wanted, but I can also use it for every day wear! It seems to be that the beads are attached to the band very well. I&#x27;m so happy with this, I would recommend to someone!</li>
            <li> Fits head nice. Not to tight or lose. Nice design for a special day and not to over the top for a everyday look. Very comfortable. Great color. Looks good with blonde, red or dark hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, bought for 1930 party, band nice and slim so easy to hide in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can be worn many ways. And not only a wear once, well made.</li>
            <li> A little small for me but I was able to wear it for the whole night anyway. Great for the Gatsby themed bachelorette party.</li>
            <li> It was pretty enough but if you&#x27;re looking for a headpiece for a Roarin&#x27; 20s party, this might be a bit lame.  It was advertised as such, and it did not stand out.  I&#x27;ve since given it away without wearing it.</li>
            <li> It worked awesome for prom but after a few hours it hurt my head</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend who was going to a Roaring 20&#x27;s themed wedding. She loved and received a ton of complements.  It stayed in throughout the night of dancing.</li>

            <li> I bought this headband for my prom which is in May. My dress is black with silver accents, so this headband was a perfect buy! It&#x27;s very flapper-esque, and it is also very comfortable. The beading is beautiful. I highly recommend this product! (:</li>
