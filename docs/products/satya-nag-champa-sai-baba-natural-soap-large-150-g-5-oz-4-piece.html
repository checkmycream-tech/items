            <li>If you like the fragrance of lemon and wood smell , I think you&#x27;ll enjoy this soap !!</li>
            <li>Like a good friend of mine , who offered me a bar of this Awesome soap said, once you try it you&#x27;ll want to include it in your daily shower routine ..</li>
            <li>First, the soap smells great.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent</li>
            <li>Just makes getting up in the morning more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I think I will buy some lotion to intensify the scent but love it</li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champa scent.  </li>

            <li>I love the smell.</li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on amazon now that I&#x27;m living overseas.</li>
            <li>well I love the smell</li>
            <li>Many people comment on it when I&#x27;m in a meeting or close proximity like a car or elevator .  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa is my favorite scent for incense and the soap smells the same and will be wonderful to use in my guest baths&lt;</li>
            <li>This soap smells awesome as you open the package..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice mild soap.  </li>
            <li>Too many soaps use palm oil in their ingredients because it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>smells really good good felling soap makes skin fill clean but not dry holds up</li>
            <li>I use this soap in combination with Dudu Osun Soap because I break out with acne easily.  </li>
            <li>Dudu Osun is a great exfoliant and does a good job controlling break outs but can sometimes be too harsh on your face.  </li>
            <li>Really love the quality and how mild and cleansing</li>
            <li>Quick shipping as always amazon!</li>
            <li>When they arrived they smelled great and my significant other really liked them.  </li>
            <li>the scent is noticeable but light on the skin.</li>
            <li>If you like Nag Champa, you will enjoy using this soap.</li>
            <li>- I even replaced my facial cleanser with it and saw great results in the skin balance and condition.  </li>
            <li>And when I buy the 4 pack, I get free travel bars to put in my overnite case.</li>
            <li>I also buy and enjoy their brand of incense as well .  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa is my answer to turning from Gross to absolutely remarkable in one easy shower .</li>
            <li>Definately worth it!</li>
            <li>even majkes a unique gift.</li>
            <li>the aroma had me excited.  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa Natural Soap has been my favorite soap for many years.</li>
            <li>I leaves me clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The last good bar of Satya Sai Baba</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, and it actually works better than most face soaps - although I know that it&#x27;s not intended for your face.</li>
            <li>They make a rich lather and although large are easy to handle so they do not fall out of your hand as you are moving them around your body.</li>
            <li>Smells great, they send samples of other scented saps am</li>
            <li>a quick and convenient way go.</li>
            <li>I have found a new favorite with this Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me because when I bought the large Nag Champa incense pack, I got a bonus pack of incense sticks in rose, if I&#x27;m remembering correctly.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and it gives your skin a very very fresh and clean feel.  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome but is the only soap that has ever dried out my skin</li>
            <li>it is so effective at cleaning silicone lubricants such as Gun Oil (also highly recommended), if you catch my drift..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same two soaps for over thirty years because I enjoyed their scent and performance.</li>
            <li>Acid\\&quot; as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>I like the exotic, incense-like smell, but it is likely not to the tastes of people who prefer soaps like &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The soap is made of all natural ingredients and vegan friendly.  </li>
            <li>THIS SOAP IS A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT HAS A NICE SMELL AND IS A NICE SIZE BAR.</li>
            <li>I dont think animal fat in my pores is a positive thing...</li>
            <li>I have ordered it before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>So you see, you just replace three items with one, that is economic.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see buying it again unless I notice that it really contributes to the care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Within days my elbows and legs were soft and completely free of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Product was advertised as NEW</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is not the first nor the last time I will do so.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the speedy service!</li>
            <li>I would give this product 5 stars if I knew they sourced their palm ingredient from a sustainable source (like Dr Bronner&#x27;s Natural Soap).</li>
            <li>Nag Champa Soap is natural and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very pricey considering how fast it disolves from typical use.</li>
            <li>A combination of little luxury and indulgence for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Soft and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  </li>

            <li> The bars last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> As I inhaled it up close...it smelled like plain old soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who may not be aware: Palm oil products (especially ones from Borneo where orangutan populations are so endangered.) are environmentally destructive since rainforest and other local tropical habitat are often burned and/or clear cut to make way for palm oil farms.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to add the scented soap to my evening ritual, but it was a bit of a fail.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> the four pack (never ordered the single or two-pack)</li>
            <li> Now, I need to apply lotion to elbows and legs just as I do using any other soap.  </li>
            <li> No more itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cut the price in half and the rating would go to 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> Grat soap little to harsh for the face</li>
            <li> Even buying it online - it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> They are mush less expensive than any boutique soap and for those of you who cringe because you can&#x27;t break away from your 99 cent ivory, Nag Champa is less drying, so you don&#x27;t need any extra moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> As a guy who works in the Construction industry I know a few things about Sweaty and Smelly !  </li>
            <li> this soap is; sadly it does contain \\&quot;Distilled Palm Fatty</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> So Sad.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Insane soap.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the scent and it&#x27;s a nice mild soap.  Just makes getting up in the morning more tolerable.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good and is so relaxing while I&#x27;m taking a shower the scent is noticeable but light on the skin. I think I will buy some lotion to intensify the scent but love it but itself all the same.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is wonderful.  The bars last a long time too.  If you like Nag Champa, you will enjoy using this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa scent.  Grat soap little to harsh for the face but I love the smell. 4 starts for being toooooo spendy.</li>
            <li> Yessir. I&#x27;ve used the same two soaps for over thirty years because I enjoyed their scent and performance. I have found a new favorite with this Nag Champa. It is top-shelf soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and love it!  Improved the condition of my skin - I even replaced my facial cleanser with it and saw great results in the skin balance and condition.  I have very sensitive skin and I even shave with it.</li>
            <li> Really love the quality and how mild and cleansing this soap is; sadly it does contain \\&quot;Distilled Palm Fatty Acid\\&quot; as the first ingredient. For those who may not be aware: Palm oil products (especially ones from Borneo where orangutan populations are so endangered.) are environmentally destructive since rainforest and other local tropical habitat are often burned and/or clear cut to make way for palm oil farms. Too many soaps use palm oil in their ingredients because it is so cheap. So Sad. I would give this product 5 stars if I knew they sourced their palm ingredient from a sustainable source (like Dr Bronner&#x27;s Natural Soap).</li>
            <li> I bought the soaps as a gift.  When they arrived they smelled great and my significant other really liked them.  A combination of little luxury and indulgence for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchase this soap regularly. I love the smell and the quality of the soap. The scent lasts all day and is very refreshing and people always ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa Natural Soap has been my favorite soap for many years. And when I buy the 4 pack, I get free travel bars to put in my overnite case. Great incense too.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, with a nice smell. Great size for what your paying for. I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this soap. I use it to bathe and as a shampoo. It is not too drying, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing either. The smell is what does it for me; absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> These soaps are very satisfying whether or not you are a fan of the Nag Champa incense itself. They make a rich lather and although large are easy to handle so they do not fall out of your hand as you are moving them around your body. Happily, they faithfully replicate the scent of the incense also. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I began using this soap while in Puerto Rico.  Even buying it online - it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s a great smelling soap &amp; fully animal &amp; eco-friendly!  Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and it&#x27;s worse in the winter. Nag Champa Soap is natural and moisturizing. It does not strip the oil from your skin. I shower and then apply lotion and my skin remains moisturized all day. No more itchy dry skin. This is the only soap I use. I will order it again and again. The pleasant scent is a bonus.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP IS A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT HAS A NICE SMELL AND IS A NICE SIZE BAR. BUY THE MULTI PACK BECAUSE ITS CHEAPER PER BAR.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for Christmas, and I know she will love it. We both enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I have ordered it before and really like it.  It smells great.  I have the incense in my home and thought I would buy the soap too.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Nag Champa Soap for years and would recommend it to anyone looking for a change from the norm. Buying it online is a quick and convenient way go. This is not the first nor the last time I will do so.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the speedy service!</li>
            <li> First, the soap smells great.  Each bar lasts over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the four pack (never ordered the single or two-pack) you get a sample lemon bar and a sample orange bar.  What a nice surprise!  It shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me because when I bought the large Nag Champa incense pack, I got a bonus pack of incense sticks in rose, if I&#x27;m remembering correctly.  At any rate, I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase because I love Nag Champa!!!!</li>
            <li> Nag Champa soap as described.  Very satisfied with this product!!  I received both bottle of Nag Champa both wiith an expiration date of 2013!  Product was advertised as NEW and I would have thought it would not have been an expired product... A bit disappointed</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is the cleanest smell out there.  The soap is made of all natural ingredients and vegan friendly.  Get the pack instead of buying individually.  They are mush less expensive than any boutique soap and for those of you who cringe because you can&#x27;t break away from your 99 cent ivory, Nag Champa is less drying, so you don&#x27;t need any extra moisturizer.  I shave with it so you can replace shave cream as well.  So you see, you just replace three items with one, that is economic.  Try it out; once you do, you will never go back to what is called &amp;#34;bars of soap&amp;#34; in the stores.</li>
            <li> Insane soap. First time using it and I will continue to use it. Great smell in the shower and it feels great when using it.</li>
            <li> As my baby and I are lying here so close yet with slippery fingers regretting the fact we are out of Nag Champa soap and it is so effective at cleaning silicone lubricants such as Gun Oil (also highly recommended), if you catch my drift..</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I leaves me clean and refreshed. I don&#x27;t wear deodorant and this soap helps keep my scent managed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think the manufacturer changed the formula for this soap. When I first started using it two years ago, it was the best soap around. Within days my elbows and legs were soft and completely free of dry skin.  Now, I need to apply lotion to elbows and legs just as I do using any other soap.  The last good bar of Satya Sai Baba I used had a date code of 2011.  The ones I&#x27;ve purchased since had date codes of 2012. I am no longer impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells fantastic, and it actually works better than most face soaps - although I know that it&#x27;s not intended for your face. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The lather from is is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> This soap has a good smell. It is all natural and it gives your skin a very very fresh and clean feel.  I use this soap in combination with Dudu Osun Soap because I break out with acne easily.  Dudu Osun is a great exfoliant and does a good job controlling break outs but can sometimes be too harsh on your face.  I switch up between these two soaps for a good balance.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome but is the only soap that has ever dried out my skin</li>
            <li> thats why I buy it regularly. Smells great, they send samples of other scented saps am&lt;br /&gt;nd even majkes a unique gift. As a sufferer of acne Vulgaris I dont think animal fat in my pores is a positive thing...</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Glad to find it on amazon now that I&#x27;m living overseas. One bar lasts me 2-3 weeks it&#x27;s such a value and of course, the best scent ever. Quick shipping as always amazon!</li>
            <li> Soft and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  Smells great of course.</li>
            <li> smells really good good felling soap makes skin fill clean but not dry holds up well I love the smell</li>
            <li> Like a good friend of mine , who offered me a bar of this Awesome soap said, once you try it you&#x27;ll want to include it in your daily shower routine ..As a guy who works in the Construction industry I know a few things about Sweaty and Smelly !  Nag Champa is my answer to turning from Gross to absolutely remarkable in one easy shower . Many people comment on it when I&#x27;m in a meeting or close proximity like a car or elevator .  I also buy and enjoy their brand of incense as well .  If you like the fragrance of lemon and wood smell , I think you&#x27;ll enjoy this soap !!</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite scent for incense and the soap smells the same and will be wonderful to use in my guest baths&lt;br /&gt;as well as mine own ! I have heard that they make excellent drawer fragrances !</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Nag Champa incense, smells good but I wanted the incense smell. Very pricey considering how fast it disolves from typical use. Cut the price in half and the rating would go to 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years.  I like the exotic, incense-like smell, but it is likely not to the tastes of people who prefer soaps like &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome as you open the package..the aroma had me excited.  But, when I totally removed it from the box...soap in hand...I was disappointed.  As I inhaled it up close...it smelled like plain old soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a nag champa &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; and have nag champa scented shea butter and the incense --both of which I can&#x27;t get enough.  I was so excited to add the scented soap to my evening ritual, but it was a bit of a fail.  I don&#x27;t see buying it again unless I notice that it really contributes to the care of my skin.  Again - from a fragrance standpoint...its okay at best.</li>
