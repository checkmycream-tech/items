            <li> Love this cologne by Gap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5yrs and get enough of it.  My only fear is that Gap will discontinue it.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if that happens.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I feel like I have to drown myself in it for it to linger through the day though. Could just be me.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite perfume only found, so far, in &amp;#34;The Gap&amp;#34; stores in Argentina. Ordered 3 bottles when I went  to visit family in the USA. I like it too - on her!</li>
