            <li>just like it shows in the picture but the clipping part is more plastic than i thought</li>
            <li>Really cute</li>

            <li>Am still trying to figure out how to use this for the greater advantage.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I opened this package, but as soon as I pulled the clip out, the decorations fell off.</li>
            <li>Definitely cute and good price thanks</li>
            <li>BETTER TO PASS THIS CHEAPLY MADE ITEM.</li>
            <li>The butterfly is gorgeous, the whole design is together and glued onto the clip.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect other than that.  </li>
            <li>And like the other review said; I have to figure out what the best way is to use this clip. ...</li>
            <li>it was beautiful but not as big as i thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I was able to easily fix it with some super glue.</li>
            <li>Pretty, pretty, pretty!!!!!</li>
            <li>However, I can get the sides pulled up and held which works just fine.</li>
            <li>Given a little time, I will discover how best to wear this.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly .</li>
            <li>Very, very pretty.  </li>
            <li>and it is so very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>This was very pretty</li>
            <li>I like that these are lite in weight, for my very young grand daughters.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get it, but it fell apart after first use.</li>
            <li>I definitely want to wear it for some really nice occasions.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but it has separators, like a rake, and it is a real pain in the butt for extremely curly hair!  </li>
            <li>It holds both of my daughters hair and a small pony tail on me had complements of it, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very very feminine and pretty.</li>
            <li>This hair pin is so pretty.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty barrette, but it won&#x27;t stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>From what I can tell I should be able to just glue it back on, but don&#x27;t fell as if I should have to so soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>this is pretty bought for daughter</li>
            <li>It can be worn in the back or on the side, even on the top.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to wear it as my hair style is short.</li>
            <li>Very pretty hair jewel, I would highly recommend it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Probably best for young girls with thin hair.</li>
            <li>It will make a lovely gift to a friend with long hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s cheap, price and quality.</li>
            <li>Vibrent colors but very elegent and fashionable.  </li>
            <li>Is much prettier than it looks in picture.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty cheap and has a very strange twisting clasp that doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I will attempt to glue it back together with special locking glue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they would (obliviously &amp; visibly) glue such a quality piece of gorgeous decorative butterflies and flowers to such a low quality clip.</li>
            <li>Cute little plastic hair peice.</li>
            <li>but its more like a little banana comb with the butterflies on both sides of it  </li>
            <li>Would be really good for thin hair.</li>
            <li>and it opens right in the middle.</li>
            <li>It really stands out against my dark hair, I get lots of compliments on how pretty it is,</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all</li>
            <li>Having never worn it I opened it yesterday and both ends of one side came completely off one side.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it has a different clasp than normal.  </li>
            <li>This clip is similar to an old fashioned banana clip, only it&#x27;s not too big, not too small, just right.</li>
            <li>Lopsided, hard ot figure out how to wear it, but very pretty.</li>

            <li> a little smaller than I expected but pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid the golden layer will quickly fall of if I heavily use it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than other hair clips&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> (i expected it metal ish )</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure she&#x27;ll actually use it to hold up only half.  </li>
            <li> All plastic and rather hard to open and shut so don&#x27;t know how long will work before something breaks.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, all plastic, impossible to use because it has 2 sides with all the raised bits.</li>
            <li> i should have sent it back when only one hole was broken.</li>
            <li> to heavy to stay in place even when closed.</li>
            <li> It is not a large clip, i.e., I cannot get all of my hair held with it, but I have very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> the clip is a little weird, like those old style \\&quot;banana\\&quot; clips...</li>
            <li> This is just heavy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heavily used it yet.</li>
            <li> Pretty doesn&#x27;t count for anything if I can&#x27;t wear it.  :(</li>
            <li> it is difficult to open, then the flower oart came out of the hole it was in to attach it to the plastic clip part.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with</li>
            <li> I think it may suit those with not too thick of hair.</li>
            <li> This clip seems very small however it holds my hair all day</li>
            <li> The clip part is a little difficult to close, once it is in the hair.  </li>
            <li> It fits well and adds a delicate and feminine look for casual or Spring time.</li>
            <li> Came in broken bad quality don&#x27;t buy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very, very pretty.  Well made.  Are as pictured.  Arrived in perfect condition.  My clips were just as pictured---yeah that!</li>
            <li> not what I thought it would be, it closes like a banana clip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but very small.  There is no way this will hold all of the hair on my daughter&#x27;s head and I&#x27;m not sure she&#x27;ll actually use it to hold up only half.  The measurements are from tip to tip so that includes the clasp area that won&#x27;t hold the hair.</li>
            <li> Came in broken bad quality don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This hair clip is elegant and gorgeous! It was delivered earlier than expected. Nice!</li>
            <li> It fits well and adds a delicate and feminine look for casual or Spring time. Good for anytime you feel.</li>
            <li> Cheap, all plastic, impossible to use because it has 2 sides with all the raised bits. I pulled off one side of each barrette with pliers to use. Doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all. Probably best for young girls with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made, I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments. Very comfortable, not bulky.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, very strong beautiful details, its the size it says,  I would it like it bigger but its OK. It holds both of my daughters hair and a small pony tail on me had complements of it, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is just heavy. I have to use bobby pins in order to keep it in place.  It would be perfect other than that.  It is lovely!</li>
            <li> gorgeous.... pictures do not do justice... love it, and will defin buy more</li>
            <li> Will not hold in hair....to heavy to stay in place even when closed.</li>
            <li> This hair pin is so pretty.I definitely want to wear it for some really nice occasions.</li>
            <li> This clip seems very small however it holds my hair all day and it is so very pretty</li>
            <li> The item was cute. I was really excited to get it, but it fell apart after first use. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Very pretty hair jewel, I would highly recommend it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The decorative part of this clip is of great quality, but the clip itself is plastic, painted gold and chipped right away. I don&#x27;t know why they would (obliviously &amp; visibly) glue such a quality piece of gorgeous decorative butterflies and flowers to such a low quality clip. I recommend only if you are looking for a one time use, and don&#x27;t count on it staying in the hair properly for all hair types. Overall, it&#x27;s cheap, price and quality. Ps- the clip is a little weird, like those old style \\&quot;banana\\&quot; clips... Hard to work with</li>
            <li> It was broke when I got it in the mail.  I was able to easily fix it with some super glue.</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I expected but pretty. Would be really good for thin hair. Not heavy at all so it stays in place well.</li>
            <li> Great craft man ship and beautiful as well. Easy to use in hair and looks great. Got several comments on it. Would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this Barrett. They are beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Cute little plastic hair peice.</li>
            <li> This barette is very dainty and I was surprised that it has a different clasp than normal.  I am not fond of the closing mechanisum but am very pleased with the beauty.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, however I did not know this was not a barrette, this is a clip that is intertwined at the end where the gold part is, you undo it and it opens right in the middle. This was not described by the seller. But is nice</li>
            <li> I like this hair clip, it&#x27;s very pretty and looks good in my hair. I just have to figure out how to use it in my hair. It&#x27;s different than other hair clips&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> Very nice for the money.  Seems sturdy.  Have used several times with no issues.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty barrette, but it won&#x27;t stay in my hair.  Pretty doesn&#x27;t count for anything if I can&#x27;t wear it.  :(</li>
            <li> Lopsided, hard ot figure out how to wear it, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful!!!  Love it</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I opened this package, but as soon as I pulled the clip out, the decorations fell off. From what I can tell I should be able to just glue it back on, but don&#x27;t fell as if I should have to so soon. It seems pretty cheap and has a very strange twisting clasp that doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy. Probably won&#x27;t wear it and don&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> easy to use and looks great in the hair</li>
            <li> Lovely, bought two. Vibrent colors but very elegent and fashionable.  I ware it often. Can be worn night or day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and works very well!  Arrived as promised, I would recommend this seller happily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty. However, I think the clip is made from plastic. I haven&#x27;t heavily used it yet. I am afraid the golden layer will quickly fall of if I heavily use it.</li>
            <li> This hair piece is beautiful!! And like the other review said; I have to figure out what the best way is to use this clip. ...and I will, because it&#x27;s beautiful...&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> Pretty, pretty, pretty!!!!!</li>
            <li> All plastic and rather hard to open and shut so don&#x27;t know how long will work before something breaks.  It really is VERY attractive though.</li>
            <li> it was beautiful but not as big as i thought it would be.  However, to my suprise, it held my hair</li>
            <li> It is ok but not made the best pretty light weight love the butterflies took almost a month to get here but is ok I will order from here again...</li>
            <li> I like that these are lite in weight, for my very young grand daughters. Very pretty</li>
            <li> hair clip is lovely; everyone has commented on it and wondered where I purchased it.  I have purchased several of these hair clips and given them as gifts.</li>
            <li> Beautiful~ just like it shows in the picture but the clipping part is more plastic than i thought (i expected it metal ish ) but it makes it easier to clip on. The butterfly is gorgeous, the whole design is together and glued onto the clip. Really cute i wear this so often! ^-^</li>
            <li> this is pretty bought for daughter thought it was more of a Barrett but its more like a little banana comb with the butterflies on both sides of it  is made out of plastic</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but it has separators, like a rake, and it is a real pain in the butt for extremely curly hair!  Wish it was just smooth!</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and makes a great fashion statement. It really stands out against my dark hair, I get lots of compliments on how pretty it is,</li>
            <li> Very very feminine and pretty. Holds well. It is not a large clip, i.e., I cannot get all of my hair held with it, but I have very long, thick hair. However, I can get the sides pulled up and held which works just fine.</li>
            <li> Definitely cute and good price thanks</li>
            <li> This was very pretty and I was happy with it but after a couple times wearing it, the pin came out. I think it may suit those with not too thick of hair.</li>
            <li> This clip is similar to an old fashioned banana clip, only it&#x27;s not too big, not too small, just right. It can be worn in the back or on the side, even on the top.  It&#x27;s delicate and pretty.  It can be worn with almost anything.  I love it and it&#x27;s versatility.&lt;br /&gt;A Tillman</li>
            <li> Is much prettier than it looks in picture. Arrived quickly .</li>
            <li> i waited quite a while before actually receiving it in the mail. it looks nice in the picture. it is difficult to open, then the flower oart came out of the hole it was in to attach it to the plastic clip part. i didn&#x27;t know the clip portion was plastic or i never would have purchased it.  Having never worn it I opened it yesterday and both ends of one side came completely off one side. i should have sent it back when only one hole was broken. I will attempt to glue it back together with special locking glue. BETTER TO PASS THIS CHEAPLY MADE ITEM.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous. I just have not had the opportunity to wear them yet. They seem to me to be for more of a dressy look. But I love em.</li>
            <li> Am still trying to figure out how to use this for the greater advantage.  The clip part is a little difficult to close, once it is in the hair.  Given a little time, I will discover how best to wear this.</li>
            <li> It shipped from china, it looks beautiful , but for the quality is so so . When I clip my hair with it , it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to wear it as my hair style is short. It will make a lovely gift to a friend with long hair. It is a beautiful hair clip.</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price. Product is as advertised. Arrived promptly!</li>
