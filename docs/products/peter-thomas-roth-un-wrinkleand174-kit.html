            <li>I have been using peter thomas roth products for some time now, and I love that I can buy it cheaper on amazon!  </li>
            <li>This got here quickly which was awesome as I was very excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>Really liked the lip gloss</li>
            <li>I love PTR.</li>
            <li>I love his products.</li>
            <li>I really I love the lipgloss...</li>
            <li>Love the products by Peter Thomas Roth.  </li>
            <li>I like the lip gloss color and feel, however it does not stay on your lips for more than 30 minutes and that is without eating or drinking.</li>
            <li>I sure notice a difference in my skin using his products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this kit.  </li>
            <li>After a week my face is more youthful looking and</li>
            <li>I did NOT get the unwrinkle night that I was very excited about</li>
            <li>the fine lines on my forehead are gone:)</li>
            <li>and I am amazed that even after washing my face, these STILL lift dirt that I guess regular cleansing didn&#x27;t get, so good for my pores!</li>
            <li>Fine products.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the disappearance of fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Please note, the picture is not an accurate depiction of what you&#x27;ll receive in the mail.  </li>
            <li>anyone who buys this kit will really enjoy this skin treatment .Thank</li>
            <li>All a great bargain for the price and everything actually works!</li>
            <li>I really liked how fast I got and</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and wrinkles are minimized.  </li>
            <li>After all the reviews I switched from the Laser Free Regenerator line.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant change in my skin after one use.</li>
            <li>I have used various Peter Thomas Roth items and have been pleased with most of them, however, I used this for a month and saw no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>the older I get the more</li>
            <li>I love it and have seen some good results in just a few days.</li>
            <li>Purchase for my friend , she like it very much !</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think all of it is necessary and choose which to apply and when but still love it!</li>
            <li>Yes, they can be a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, and it lasts longer than you think it will.  </li>
            <li>Everything was good as expected except for the &amp;#34;Un Wrinkle Turbo&amp;#34;  it was diluted!</li>
            <li>I will say that if I use the turbo un-wrinkle cream (in the gold bottle) in the morning that my face tends to stay oily all day, so I have stopped using it in the morning, but other than that, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This was a problem when I first got it, 30% got all over my table.</li>
            <li>PTR products really do work!  </li>
            <li>It does absorb well and feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty picky.</li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products, and use them religiously.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it works better.</li>
            <li>I use the UnWrinkle line and the Mega Rich Intensive Night Cream for when I get super dry.</li>
            <li>The lip gloss is a pretty color, and has decent staying power.</li>
            <li>I really like these products.</li>
            <li>But anyway, I really like the pads</li>
            <li>Went a couple of weeks without anything and could really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>Peel pads are great not only for face, but for hands, elbows or anyplace rough or dry.</li>
            <li>Have noticed a difference in fine wrinkles above my lip line and used on the back of my hands ,and really noticed a change.</li>
            <li>Love the shade, texture, etc but its going to waste</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not cheap so more would have been helpful.</li>
            <li>After sitting it right side up on the counter for days I&#x27;m still having the same problem.</li>
            <li>This was a new line of skin care for me to try</li>
            <li>It suggests trying the pads in the small jar out, also using it on the top of your hands a couple times a week...</li>
            <li>, I use it in the morning before bb cream and makeup, its not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li>I have switched back to his &amp;#34;no laser resurface&amp;#34; products and am much happier with the results.  </li>
            <li>My mom likely it, but I did not do very well with it, as I have sensitives skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially for winter.</li>
            <li>I am always a little iffy about buying based on reviews because I never really know is the review genuine or made up by the product manufacturer.</li>

            <li> it is unbelievable how much smoother your hands look after just having the product on them for only a couple of minutes!</li>
            <li> I have used these products and glad I bought this as a less expensive set.</li>
            <li> The night cream is slightly heavy, but seeing as it&#x27;s a NIGHT cream, I don&#x27;t have any real objections to it being heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and have Dry to very dry skin with a somewhat oily t-zone ...</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had actually stopped using his resurface line to try the unwrinkle products, and I think my face actually looked worse.  </li>
            <li> , I feel the little tingle while waiting to rinse it off</li>
            <li> Not greasy, just heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe any of the scientific claims are any less then there to make females seem &#x27;science dumb&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Also, the pads are so small that it&#x27;s really hard to hold them to rub all over your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The lipgloss is broken.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle kit as picture showed on line, but received the wrong kit.</li>
            <li> I read the product description closely, so I wasn&#x27;t shocked to see a lip gloss vs. the eye cream in the</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, going to return it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only thing I like out of these 4 products is the Un-Wrinkle Pads they do work.  The Turbo Un-Wrinkle is a joke.</li>
            <li> I love PTR. I love his products. This got here quickly which was awesome as I was very excited to get it.  I did not get this kit. The kit I got had the eye cream, the pads, the turbo, and LIPGLOSS. The lipgloss is broken. There is no seal to keep the product in. I have to leave it standing up on the counter, and even then, when i open it, the product gets everywhere.   I did NOT get the unwrinkle night that I was very excited about and I&#x27;m upset with the lip gloss. There is no seal to keep the product in, so the lip gloss pours out. This was a problem when I first got it, 30% got all over my table. After sitting it right side up on the counter for days I&#x27;m still having the same problem. It just globs out when you put the wand in. Love the shade, texture, etc but its going to waste and I&#x27;m super sad about it. Everything else is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product!  PTR products really do work!  I can already see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Gold in my skincare? Fine products. I don&#x27;t believe any of the scientific claims are any less then there to make females seem &#x27;science dumb&#x27;. It provided excellent skincare at its price point.</li>
            <li> I really I love the lipgloss... And this kit was a great deal.... And the peel pads are really great for winter anyone who buys this kit will really enjoy this skin treatment .Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Received product is different to what&#x27;s described. I got A face toner instead of the un-wrinkle eye. Very disappointed, going to return it.</li>
            <li> Love the products by Peter Thomas Roth.  Really liked the lip gloss, that was one I had never tried.</li>
            <li> I really like these products. I am always a little iffy about buying based on reviews because I never really know is the review genuine or made up by the product manufacturer. But anyway, I really like the pads, I feel the little tingle while waiting to rinse it off and I am amazed that even after washing my face, these STILL lift dirt that I guess regular cleansing didn&#x27;t get, so good for my pores! The lip gloss is a pretty color, and has decent staying power. The night cream is slightly heavy, but seeing as it&#x27;s a NIGHT cream, I don&#x27;t have any real objections to it being heavy on my face. Not greasy, just heavy. But by morning, I do feel my skin is softer for it. I love the turbo stuff!!! I feel it tightening my skin, I use it in the morning before bb cream and makeup, its not heavy or greasy and I use it at night before the cream. It does absorb well and feels really soft and smooth. I do like these products and will continue to try other items from Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> I ordered Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle kit as picture showed on line, but received the wrong kit. I was not happy with it and had to return it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially for winter. Peel pads are great not only for face, but for hands, elbows or anyplace rough or dry. Night cream is the best anywhere. Best of all is Unwrinkle Turbo. All a great bargain for the price and everything actually works!</li>
            <li> Purchase for my friend , she like it very much !</li>
            <li> I have used these products and glad I bought this as a less expensive set. They are nice creams and smell good but for the claims of reducing lines or wrinkles I have not see that. I like the lip gloss color and feel, however it does not stay on your lips for more than 30 minutes and that is without eating or drinking.</li>
            <li> Love this!! I am still within only weeks of use, have already received a lot of compliments!! I can see a difference!!</li>
            <li> I have used various Peter Thomas Roth items and have been pleased with most of them, however, I used this for a month and saw no difference at all.  I had actually stopped using his resurface line to try the unwrinkle products, and I think my face actually looked worse.  I have switched back to his &amp;#34;no laser resurface&amp;#34; products and am much happier with the results.  Also, the pads are so small that it&#x27;s really hard to hold them to rub all over your face and neck.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked how fast I got and the money I saved this is a great product</li>
            <li> Everything was good as expected except for the &amp;#34;Un Wrinkle Turbo&amp;#34;  it was diluted! I know b/c have been using this product for two years</li>
            <li> Really good products. Have noticed a difference in fine wrinkles above my lip line and used on the back of my hands ,and really noticed a change.</li>
            <li> I sure notice a difference in my skin using his products. Yes, they can be a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> This was a new line of skin care for me to try and I&#x27;m pretty picky. I&#x27;m now using a few of the products religiously. Kind-of pricey but I like changing things up once in a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome products. My face has been radiant. People have mentioned that I appear like I&#x27;m glowing, my skin feels flawless</li>
            <li> the older I get the more I try to deny that I am going to have to deal with things such as wrinkles.  Denial time is over.  I heard great things about Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products, and thought I would go ahead and spend the money on giving it a try.  The products are great.  I will say that if I use the turbo un-wrinkle cream (in the gold bottle) in the morning that my face tends to stay oily all day, so I have stopped using it in the morning, but other than that, I am very pleased.  Worth the money, and it lasts longer than you think it will.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It suggests trying the pads in the small jar out, also using it on the top of your hands a couple times a week... it is unbelievable how much smoother your hands look after just having the product on them for only a couple of minutes! And the Turbo Unwrinkle Serum gives your skin that youthful glow that you may not have seen on it in many years! Amazing products... wish I&#x27;d found them 10 years ago!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this kit.  Please note, the picture is not an accurate depiction of what you&#x27;ll receive in the mail.  I read the product description closely, so I wasn&#x27;t shocked to see a lip gloss vs. the eye cream in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products!!!</li>
            <li> The price was good. I love Peter Thomas Roth products, and use them religiously.  Quality and great price. Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I love these PTR products! I just wish the kit still came with the eye unwrinkle cream instead of the liploss. Still a great product! I use the UnWrinkle line and the Mega Rich Intensive Night Cream for when I get super dry. I&#x27;m 47 and have Dry to very dry skin with a somewhat oily t-zone ...sometimes prone to sensitivity. I&#x27;ve had nothing but great results :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom and myself. My mom likely it, but I did not do very well with it, as I have sensitives skin and I have to be careful with it. I&#x27;d probably buy it for my again but not for myself</li>
            <li> Have used PTR unwrinkle products for several years.  My skin feels smooth and wrinkles are minimized.  Went a couple of weeks without anything and could really see the difference.  I&#x27;m back on track now with my PTR!!</li>
            <li> This kit delivers what it promise!! I noticed a significant change in my skin after one use. After a week my face is more youthful looking and the fine lines on my forehead are gone:)</li>
            <li> I have been using peter thomas roth products for some time now, and I love that I can buy it cheaper on amazon!  they all work well I think I have purchased everything but the makeup they make!  it is definitely worth the cost, and more!!!</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I switched from the Laser Free Regenerator line. Actually, it works better. Also, they don&#x27;t tell you the sizes in this package so you only get 20 pads. Not enough to know if it&#x27;s even going to work. They&#x27;re not cheap so more would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> I love it and have seen some good results in just a few days. I don&#x27;t think all of it is necessary and choose which to apply and when but still love it!</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit.  I have noticed the disappearance of fine lines around my eyes.  Good sizes for traveling too.</li>
