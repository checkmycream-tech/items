            <li>I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great deal for this size bottle!</li>
            <li>I bought this becuase I received a sample and liked the smell, not because I&#x27;m a Taylor Swift fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>A warm vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>the smell is by far one of the best sandalwood combos out there.  </li>

            <li>I loved the light, fruit/flowery fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge in a good way.</li>

            <li>love the scent.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments</li>
            <li>Love how it smells on my wife.</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this perfume by Taylor Swift.</li>
            <li>I have also tried her Wonderstruck perfume which I love as well.</li>
            <li>This and the Gomez if byfar my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I will be  ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on it and</li>
            <li>So I am ordering more :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent</li>
            <li>Authentic product.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve received MANY compliments on this perfume as I did Wonderstruck.</li>
            <li>But I have to say that I love this one even more.</li>
            <li>and I come to love this scent.</li>
            <li>I think this scent is more of 18-20 year olds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a perfume snob, and I have to say, this has become one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I love how cute the bottle is.</li>
            <li>love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I rarely, better yet never buy perfume from entertainers but Taylor Swift has nailed it with this one, will purchase another one soon</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume, both men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>It has a very beautiful rich but soft vanilla smell to it</li>
            <li>Very clean smell.</li>
            <li>I loved this scent when I first smelled it at the mall, but was hesitant to buy it for $65.  </li>
            <li>It arrived a day early and the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s warm and sweet, without being over spiced.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a unique smelling perfume then buy this!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this, not to strong.</li>
            <li>Any lady would love to have this in her collection of fine scents.</li>
            <li>Its very sweet and vanilla-y in the end.</li>
            <li>Amazing I love the scent at first</li>
            <li>It also came with some other Taylor Swift stuff, which was awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>Taylor by Taylor Swift isn&#x27;t to strong at all</li>
            <li>I was a little embarrassed to be buying Taylor Swift perfume, but honestly it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Love this scent and received quickly.</li>
            <li>Bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>I turned 22 this year and have been a huge Taylor Swift fan since she started her career at age 16.</li>
            <li>Too light.</li>
            <li>Smells great and arrived shortly after I placed the order.</li>
            <li>Gave as a gift and was very well liked.  </li>
            <li>and it was securely packaged.</li>
            <li>parfum really smells nice.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent.</li>
            <li>Wow I loved this one</li>
            <li>I bought one and loved it so much I bought another right away</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>The bottle is so playful and fun!</li>
            <li>The top has a crystal ball that is so pretty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a unique smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love this product by the first time I&#x27;ve seen it.</li>
            <li>I originally smelled this in a magazine.  </li>
            <li>Personally I like the smell of wonderstruck better, but this one&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 stars is I used it pregnant, and it smelt great with my pregnant chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Went to Macy&#x27;s to purchase it and could not justify spending that much money on myself around the holidays, so I left without it even though I loved it!  </li>
            <li>It is sweet and lucious.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3.4oz because it was such a good deal</li>
            <li>It is definitely sweet</li>
            <li>The staying power of this perfume is just incredible, just a few spritz</li>
            <li>but at first it is strong.</li>
            <li>When you first spray it, its very strong and floraly and very suffisticates</li>
            <li>This order shiopped quickly and was received in the condition</li>
            <li>When I was asked to review Taylor by Taylor Swift, I quickly accepted.  </li>
            <li>My daughter the super fan just had to have it.  </li>
            <li>awsome smell and quick delivery</li>
            <li>so fresh so clean not over powering and long lasting :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not huge on fruity/sweet perfumes, but this one reminds me of a blend of original Burberry (my all time favorite) with a hint of warm sugar.</li>
            <li>I love adding new perfume to my collection.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the sample I loved the fact that it lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite frangrances its very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>This is a great dupe for Burberry&#x27;s ETP for woman for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Probably more subtle as well which is nice for a summer evening.</li>
            <li>This really is the Taylor Swift perfume.........not some knock-off!!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely light scent that last all day for me--very rare.</li>
            <li>I like the deep wood scent as it adds a nice depth to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Almost musky - but too fresh to be a musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am 12 years old and my friends love this too.</li>
            <li>I will have to stay with my normal perfumes by Selena Gomez &amp; Katy Perry where the fruit notes are sweet and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>but this perfume got it right.</li>
            <li>and right now its 6:43 PM.</li>
            <li>Its very very feminine and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have gotten more ounces for less price.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough for me to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Normally it smells cheap</li>
            <li>I really like the fruity and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Great everyday perfume!</li>
            <li>This perfume is strong &amp; is not for the sensitive person.</li>
            <li>Great for daily wear, especially work.</li>
            <li>When I saw that there was a NEW fragrance called Taylor out, I was excited but had yet to see the magazine inserts that allow you to smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The top is so cute, as it is surrounded by pearls that add a little class!</li>
            <li>I also layered it with Pink Sugar just now and the combination is just sooo AMAZING.</li>
            <li>More for a teen.</li>
            <li>I love perfume because they are all different and add personality to whatever outfit I am wearing.</li>
            <li>I love the different colors.</li>
            <li>I also think the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>( You just don&#x27;t get a pretty bottle.)</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again but the store version is better.</li>
            <li>Purchased it from Amazon because I trust them more than an independent seller (when it comes to buying perfume).</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have not been able to smell it on me later on in the day, but my husband or others have noticed it</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this</li>
            <li>I bought it first from ulta.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really love the shape or design of the bottle, and the ring of pearls around the cap flies off every time I open it, but that&#x27;s just me nit-picking.</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li>The first thing I look at is the bottle.</li>
            <li>When Taylor first started making perfume, I went out and bought her Wonderstruck.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve checked on Amazon first..</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume and to anyone who is thinking about getting it should order this one on amazon!!</li>
            <li>Taylor tho just liked the other</li>
            <li>If you want something sweet, but not too sweet with mysterious hint</li>
            <li>love this perfume for so many reasons, not the least of which is that it has dimension.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always getting compliments ,I&#x27;m getting ready to order another bottle so that I won&#x27;t run out,)thank you.;)</li>
            <li>Its a little sweet, which I normally love.  </li>
            <li>The florals and fruits are strong, but there is a woody scent mixed in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and the scent last all day!</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised by how much I love it because I do not normally go for perfumes created by &amp;#34;stars.&amp;#34; This is my second favorite perfume to D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Very disappoint it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is the Taylor Swift perfume for cheaper than you can find it everywhere else, however, keep in mind that it did take a whole month to arrive.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My wife really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>This was one complete months worth allowance for my daughter.</li>
            <li>will last forever, is authentic and seemed to last a good few hours</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the fellas getting this for their wives, girlfriend, or mistresses!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with this</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T REALLY KNOW IF LOOKS</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper in than in the stores</li>
            <li>But no, the spray nozzle is very ill-fitting as well.  </li>
            <li>I baught from PerfumeWorld and their shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Then when it lasts longer, its very relaxing to smell.</li>
            <li>Very addicting.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>and I can really smell the lychee note.</li>
            <li>I skipped on the Enchanted because I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>I feel like I took 30 something dollars and threw them out the window, VERY dissappointed.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again and women if you&#x27;re looking to just drive men</li>
            <li>The other two taylor perfumes are more for fall/winter.</li>
            <li>I first opened the box to reveal Taylor by Taylor Swift perfume, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>She said the bottle looks the same as hers (bought at kohl&#x27;s) but the liquid in hers is much lighter and clearer (more like a white color).  </li>
            <li>It is light and has a sweet smell to it, but it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Perfume did not seem real ...was not the right color ....and did not smell the same</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>normally I wouldn&#x27;t buy a celebrity fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more suited to a younger wearer (perhaps a teen) than adult women.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble with how to get the top off</li>
            <li>Not impressed--the other perfume bottles weren&#x27;t so cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>My wife loved this for her late Christmas present.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very soft perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all women who loves soft fragrances.</li>
            <li>And the base of the bottle arround the spray top is akwardly large - makes it kind of akward to spray.</li>
            <li>This will make my 15 year old daughter day!</li>
            <li>This was the first time buying a celebrity&#x27;s perfume and I am never going back!</li>
            <li>I wore it out and considering how hot it is outside here in Hawaii, the perfume stayed on until now</li>
            <li>Not pregnant chemistry combines with this to make it slightly musky which is still good.  </li>
            <li>It is not a very strong perfume but it is distinct thats why I like it so much.</li>
            <li>and I get headaches very easily due to my super sensitive nose</li>
            <li>this perfume will surprised you.</li>
            <li>but you could tell it was old.</li>
            <li>but I developed a rash with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife (just cause) and she Absolutely loves the smell and it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It smells like a mixture of an old lady perfume and dish soap.</li>
            <li>so Considering how far that is</li>
            <li>and it last the whole day</li>
            <li>Product has either been completely altered or its expired.</li>
            <li>wild</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this perfume for a very long time and this was my first purchase of it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>For the last three years I have gotten her the new Taylor Swift Parfum and it has become a new tradition for us.  </li>
            <li>my other perfume is chanel chance fresh.</li>
            <li>Finally when I got my recent magazine, they had an insert and upon first whiff, I was hooked and went home and decided to purchase it immediately and purchased it on amazon instead of ulta.com since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>There was no way to screw it back to the bottle, which made actually trying to use the bottle difficult, so I pulled it off hoping it would be more sound underneath.  </li>
            <li>My Mom and I first saw it at Macy&#x27;s and got a little test strip of it and loved it, but it was too expensive there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry I meant to rate it a five star I love it !</li>
            <li>It does slowly fade throughout the day but you get a huge bottle so just reapply.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was yellow liquid when it should be clear.</li>
            <li>I brought in the bottle for my manger to smell to see if maybe I had purchased the wrong kind of scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this new Taylor Swift perfume scent, but I am not impressed with the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little mature for high schoolers but still has that tiny youthful scent to it.</li>
            <li>so I decided to order it instead of paying twice as much for a bottle half the size.</li>
            <li>I do agree with other people who have had trouble getting the top of the bottle off, but other than that I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>

            <li> and I will be  ordering more when I run out.</li>

            <li> I LOVE the scent</li>
            <li> Authentic product.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve received MANY compliments on this perfume as I did Wonderstruck.</li>
            <li> But I have to say that I love this one even more.</li>
            <li> and I come to love this scent.</li>
            <li> I think this scent is more of 18-20 year olds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a perfume snob, and I have to say, this has become one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I love how cute the bottle is.</li>
            <li> love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I rarely, better yet never buy perfume from entertainers but Taylor Swift has nailed it with this one, will purchase another one soon</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume, both men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> It has a very beautiful rich but soft vanilla smell to it</li>
            <li> Very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent when I first smelled it at the mall, but was hesitant to buy it for $65.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a day early and the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s warm and sweet, without being over spiced.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a unique smelling perfume then buy this!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, not to strong.</li>
            <li> Any lady would love to have this in her collection of fine scents.</li>
            <li> Its very sweet and vanilla-y in the end.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love the scent at first</li>
            <li> It also came with some other Taylor Swift stuff, which was awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> Taylor by Taylor Swift isn&#x27;t to strong at all</li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed to be buying Taylor Swift perfume, but honestly it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> Love this scent and received quickly.</li>
            <li> Bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I turned 22 this year and have been a huge Taylor Swift fan since she started her career at age 16.</li>
            <li> Too light.</li>
            <li> Smells great and arrived shortly after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and was very well liked.  </li>
            <li> and it was securely packaged.</li>
            <li> parfum really smells nice.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent.</li>
            <li> Wow I loved this one</li>
            <li> I bought one and loved it so much I bought another right away</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> The bottle is so playful and fun!</li>
            <li> The top has a crystal ball that is so pretty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a unique smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love this product by the first time I&#x27;ve seen it.</li>
            <li> I originally smelled this in a magazine.  </li>
            <li> Personally I like the smell of wonderstruck better, but this one&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars is I used it pregnant, and it smelt great with my pregnant chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Went to Macy&#x27;s to purchase it and could not justify spending that much money on myself around the holidays, so I left without it even though I loved it!  </li>
            <li> It is sweet and lucious.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4oz because it was such a good deal</li>
            <li> It is definitely sweet</li>
            <li> The staying power of this perfume is just incredible, just a few spritz</li>
            <li> but at first it is strong.</li>
            <li> When you first spray it, its very strong and floraly and very suffisticates</li>
            <li> This order shiopped quickly and was received in the condition</li>
            <li> When I was asked to review Taylor by Taylor Swift, I quickly accepted.  </li>
            <li> My daughter the super fan just had to have it.  </li>
            <li> awsome smell and quick delivery</li>
            <li> so fresh so clean not over powering and long lasting :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on fruity/sweet perfumes, but this one reminds me of a blend of original Burberry (my all time favorite) with a hint of warm sugar.</li>
            <li> I love adding new perfume to my collection.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the sample I loved the fact that it lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite frangrances its very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for Burberry&#x27;s ETP for woman for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Probably more subtle as well which is nice for a summer evening.</li>
            <li> This really is the Taylor Swift perfume.........not some knock-off!!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely light scent that last all day for me--very rare.</li>
            <li> I like the deep wood scent as it adds a nice depth to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Almost musky - but too fresh to be a musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am 12 years old and my friends love this too.</li>
            <li> I will have to stay with my normal perfumes by Selena Gomez &amp; Katy Perry where the fruit notes are sweet and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> but this perfume got it right.</li>
            <li> and right now its 6:43 PM.</li>
            <li> Its very very feminine and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have gotten more ounces for less price.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough for me to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Normally it smells cheap</li>
            <li> I really like the fruity and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Great everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> This perfume is strong &amp; is not for the sensitive person.</li>
            <li> Great for daily wear, especially work.</li>
            <li> When I saw that there was a NEW fragrance called Taylor out, I was excited but had yet to see the magazine inserts that allow you to smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The top is so cute, as it is surrounded by pearls that add a little class!</li>
            <li> I also layered it with Pink Sugar just now and the combination is just sooo AMAZING.</li>
            <li> More for a teen.</li>
            <li> I love perfume because they are all different and add personality to whatever outfit I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors.</li>
            <li> I also think the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> ( You just don&#x27;t get a pretty bottle.)</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again but the store version is better.</li>
            <li> Purchased it from Amazon because I trust them more than an independent seller (when it comes to buying perfume).</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have not been able to smell it on me later on in the day, but my husband or others have noticed it</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this</li>
            <li> I bought it first from ulta.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really love the shape or design of the bottle, and the ring of pearls around the cap flies off every time I open it, but that&#x27;s just me nit-picking.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li> The first thing I look at is the bottle.</li>
            <li> When Taylor first started making perfume, I went out and bought her Wonderstruck.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve checked on Amazon first..</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume and to anyone who is thinking about getting it should order this one on amazon!!</li>
            <li> Taylor tho just liked the other</li>
            <li> If you want something sweet, but not too sweet with mysterious hint</li>
            <li> love this perfume for so many reasons, not the least of which is that it has dimension.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments ,I&#x27;m getting ready to order another bottle so that I won&#x27;t run out,)thank you.;)</li>
            <li> Its a little sweet, which I normally love.  </li>
            <li> The florals and fruits are strong, but there is a woody scent mixed in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and the scent last all day!</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised by how much I love it because I do not normally go for perfumes created by &amp;#34;stars.&amp;#34; This is my second favorite perfume to D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Very disappoint it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the Taylor Swift perfume for cheaper than you can find it everywhere else, however, keep in mind that it did take a whole month to arrive.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> This was one complete months worth allowance for my daughter.</li>
            <li> will last forever, is authentic and seemed to last a good few hours</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the fellas getting this for their wives, girlfriend, or mistresses!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with this</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T REALLY KNOW IF LOOKS</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper in than in the stores</li>
            <li> But no, the spray nozzle is very ill-fitting as well.  </li>
            <li> I baught from PerfumeWorld and their shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Then when it lasts longer, its very relaxing to smell.</li>
            <li> Very addicting.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> and I can really smell the lychee note.</li>
            <li> I skipped on the Enchanted because I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> I feel like I took 30 something dollars and threw them out the window, VERY dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again and women if you&#x27;re looking to just drive men</li>
            <li> The other two taylor perfumes are more for fall/winter.</li>
            <li> I first opened the box to reveal Taylor by Taylor Swift perfume, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> She said the bottle looks the same as hers (bought at kohl&#x27;s) but the liquid in hers is much lighter and clearer (more like a white color).  </li>
            <li> It is light and has a sweet smell to it, but it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Perfume did not seem real ...was not the right color ....and did not smell the same</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> normally I wouldn&#x27;t buy a celebrity fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more suited to a younger wearer (perhaps a teen) than adult women.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble with how to get the top off</li>
            <li> Not impressed--the other perfume bottles weren&#x27;t so cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> My wife loved this for her late Christmas present.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very soft perfume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all women who loves soft fragrances.</li>
            <li> And the base of the bottle arround the spray top is akwardly large - makes it kind of akward to spray.</li>
            <li> This will make my 15 year old daughter day!</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying a celebrity&#x27;s perfume and I am never going back!</li>
            <li> I wore it out and considering how hot it is outside here in Hawaii, the perfume stayed on until now</li>
            <li> Not pregnant chemistry combines with this to make it slightly musky which is still good.  </li>
            <li> It is not a very strong perfume but it is distinct thats why I like it so much.</li>
            <li> and I get headaches very easily due to my super sensitive nose</li>
            <li> this perfume will surprised you.</li>
            <li> but you could tell it was old.</li>
            <li> but I developed a rash with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife (just cause) and she Absolutely loves the smell and it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of an old lady perfume and dish soap.</li>
            <li> so Considering how far that is</li>
            <li> and it last the whole day</li>
            <li> Product has either been completely altered or its expired.</li>
            <li> wild</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for a very long time and this was my first purchase of it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> For the last three years I have gotten her the new Taylor Swift Parfum and it has become a new tradition for us.  </li>
            <li> my other perfume is chanel chance fresh.</li>
            <li> Finally when I got my recent magazine, they had an insert and upon first whiff, I was hooked and went home and decided to purchase it immediately and purchased it on amazon instead of ulta.com since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> There was no way to screw it back to the bottle, which made actually trying to use the bottle difficult, so I pulled it off hoping it would be more sound underneath.  </li>
            <li> My Mom and I first saw it at Macy&#x27;s and got a little test strip of it and loved it, but it was too expensive there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I meant to rate it a five star I love it !</li>
            <li> It does slowly fade throughout the day but you get a huge bottle so just reapply.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was yellow liquid when it should be clear.</li>
            <li> I brought in the bottle for my manger to smell to see if maybe I had purchased the wrong kind of scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this new Taylor Swift perfume scent, but I am not impressed with the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little mature for high schoolers but still has that tiny youthful scent to it.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order it instead of paying twice as much for a bottle half the size.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other people who have had trouble getting the top of the bottle off, but other than that I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Finally a perfume my man can smell, that doesn&#x27;t wear off and is long lasting!</li>
            <li> When perfume comes to that point it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> however the scent for me doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t last quite as long as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but the scent does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> The smell does not seem to last very long, the appearance is a lot darker than that purchased in department stores and the box should have been wrapped in sealed plastic but this was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe how big this bottle is for the price, it&#x27;s mind blowing because when I used to buy it in the stores it was $22 for this tiny little bottle that made me feel like a giant when I held it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how long the scent lasts--for some reason scents never seem to stick to my skin type:/</li>
            <li> so I know it lasts long.</li>
            <li> Very different then the other two of hers.</li>
            <li> Its too similar to other celebrity perfumes</li>
            <li> its different from all the other Taylor perfumes</li>
            <li> but I ended up returing for the newest limited edition of Viva La Juicy.</li>
            <li> actual product not  waterd down.</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting and a little does go a long way!</li>
            <li> I am a massive fan of Taylor and had bought her previous bottles.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something a little different, then this is for you!  </li>
            <li> Her only negative was the bottle was so big</li>
            <li> Not real perfume.</li>
            <li> The one I ordered has absolutely no scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume name brand buyer.</li>
            <li> Will buy again once I run out which may be a while because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I just baught it due to the reviews</li>
            <li> I then splurged for my birthday and bought the 1.7 oz bottle at Ulta, which was still pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not worth any monies.  </li>
            <li> When I wear this perfume I receive at least 3 compliments daily!!</li>
            <li> For those skeptical about buying from an amazon retailer instead of buying straight from Macy&#x27;s dept. store don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> I had to man-handle the stopper off because it did not come off easily...and then due to that, somehow the multi-colored disc that was poorly glued to the actual bottle became loose.  </li>
            <li> but the store version lasts longer and this one smells like its been watered down somewhat.</li>
            <li> so I bumped it down to 4</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle perfume and mature with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> They also add a little sparkle to my mood and help uplift me for the day.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I liked Taylor&#x27;s Enchanted and Wonderstruck perfumes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle for what exactly the deal is here, but this smells awful and nothing at all like what it should smell like.  </li>
            <li> I usually always go for the knock-offs but after smelling and wanting Wonderstruck by Taylor Swift a few years ago, I was hooked on that perfume and it was given to me as a gift</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very faint and does not last long.</li>
            <li> Fresh and flirty hate that it&#x27;s made by Taylor swift but</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it in the store</li>
            <li> This bottle was different and in a disappointing way.</li>
            <li> However, I now find myself sneaking into her room to use this at least once a week.</li>
            <li> When I wore it to the office after receiving it, I got a lot of negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> I mean I think all perfumes and fragrances are like that</li>
            <li> but this one is just a tad softer to the nose if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> had I not paid department store price for a very questionable and likely knock-off perfume.  </li>
            <li> At first I hated how it smelled like.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent.</li>
            <li> All of my coworkers comment on it every time I wear it, and the scent is subtle without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was fake perfume.</li>
            <li> but they are wrong.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a very poor design.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I think the smell of this perfume is awful.</li>

            <li> Very disappoint it...bottle was opened seems like it&#x27;s has been used it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Too light. More for a teen. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> good price. love the perfume</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very faint and does not last long. It is not worth any monies.  I gave it away to a kid.</li>
            <li> this perfume will surprised you. really good, whenever I put it on, always get compliments about my smell. my other perfume is chanel chance fresh. this is 1/4 cheaper than it but smells surprisingly adorable.</li>
            <li> Was happy. with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, not to strong.</li>
            <li> This will make my 15 year old daughter day!</li>
            <li> If your looking for something a little different, then this is for you!  It has a very sweet vanilla kind of smell... Very different then the other two of hers. (Wonderstruck and wonderstruck enchanted) A very nice smell! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. Every time I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> A great value and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I loved this scent when I first smelled it at the mall, but was hesitant to buy it for $65.  Yeah, I&#x27;m frugal.  Glad I waited because I got it through Amazon for TWENTY BUCKS!  I&#x27;m not huge on fruity/sweet perfumes, but this one reminds me of a blend of original Burberry (my all time favorite) with a hint of warm sugar.</li>
            <li> If you want something sweet, but not too sweet with mysterious hint this is the perfume for you!!! When I wear this perfume I receive at least 3 compliments daily!! Lasts for a loooong time. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It is really nice perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy! Love it!</li>
            <li> It was okay but you could tell it was old. The perfume was turning yellow when I received it l. When perfume comes to that point it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum. It has a lovely light scent that last all day for me--very rare. The bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Great deals, nice scent</li>
            <li> This perfume is strong &amp; is not for the sensitive person. I sprayed it low on my body &amp; still I could taste in my mouth it was so over powering. Beautiful bottle, but just too potent. I will have to stay with my normal perfumes by Selena Gomez &amp; Katy Perry where the fruit notes are sweet and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Love it very good prce</li>
            <li> My husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift at my request.  I love the smell.  I am so glad to have gotten more ounces for less price.</li>
            <li> Smells great and arrived shortly after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and was very well liked.  Very nice bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the Taylor Swift perfume for cheaper than you can find it everywhere else, however, keep in mind that it did take a whole month to arrive.</li>
            <li> This order shiopped quickly and was received in the condition I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume for so many reasons, not the least of which is that it has dimension. It wears well and smells slightly different as the day wears on. My fiance loves it too.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Fresh and flirty hate that it&#x27;s made by Taylor swift but the smell is by far one of the best sandalwood combos out there.  Normally it smells cheap but this perfume got it right.</li>
            <li> Taylor is the best perfume ever. It smells so talented! Taylor by Taylor Swift isn&#x27;t to strong at all it&#x27;s a very soft perfume.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVED this. She is a BIG Taylor Swift fan so this was an awesome gift and smells great. Seller shipped promptly, great quality, great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was awesome! My best friend loves this perfume and I got it for her for Christmas, this actually came more than what I paid for. It also came with some other Taylor Swift stuff, which was awesome for the price. Would probably buy again!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My wife really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love it! Huge....authentic bottle! I reorded two of these. Great buy! Smells wonderful. Everyone else wanted like $50-60 for this size bottle so this was definetly a steal!</li>
            <li> actual product not  waterd down.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent! I love it and the bottle it comes in. I get so many compliments by men and women.</li>
            <li> This was fake perfume. The bottle I received was yellow liquid when it should be clear. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> normally I wouldn&#x27;t buy a celebrity fragrance but I smelled this in a magazine add and I was hooked ! so fresh so clean not over powering and long lasting :D I wear it everyday and get TONs of compliments very very very happy with my purchase :D</li>
            <li> taylor&#x27;s fragrances all have pretty bottles :D Personally I like the smell of wonderstruck better, but this one&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite smells. I had a hard time finding it in the store but I think I got a better deal on here anyways. Bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I love perfume because they are all different and add personality to whatever outfit I am wearing. They also add a little sparkle to my mood and help uplift me for the day. When I was asked to review Taylor by Taylor Swift, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I love adding new perfume to my collection. I love the shape, colors and theme of perfume bottles. Some perfumes tell a story or represent something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box to reveal Taylor by Taylor Swift perfume, I was pleasantly surprised. The bottle is so playful and fun! I love the different colors. The top is so cute, as it is surrounded by pearls that add a little class! The top has a crystal ball that is so pretty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent. The florals and fruits are strong, but there is a woody scent mixed in. I like the deep wood scent as it adds a nice depth to the fragrance. The scent is strong enough for me to enjoy. I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The third best of the Taylor Swift fragrance line.  My daughter the super fan just had to have it.  She should remember her fans are the youth of America and aren&#x27;t all millionaires like herself.  She could have still made nice profit and her fans would respect her even more for her respecting them.  This was one complete months worth allowance for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  I received it in plenty of time for Christmas and it was securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! It&#x27;s fruity yet woodsy! It&#x27;s strong so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and the scent last all day! Fast shipping and a great deal for this size bottle! I&#x27;m 24 and this perfume suits me well!</li>
            <li> It smells good not as fruity as people say tho I thought it had more a musk &amp; the bottle will last forever, is authentic and seemed to last a good few hours but I ended up returing for the newest limited edition of Viva La Juicy. I did like Taylor tho just liked the other more :-D</li>
            <li> This smells great but I developed a rash with it. Ugh!</li>
            <li> I bought this becuase I received a sample and liked the smell, not because I&#x27;m a Taylor Swift fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This parfum really smells nice. It&#x27;s got a unique smell. Almost musky - but too fresh to be a musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bottle. The lid was a son-of-a-gun to get off the bottle. And the base of the bottle arround the spray top is akwardly large - makes it kind of akward to spray. The bottle has a very poor design.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife (just cause) and she Absolutely loves the smell and it last throughout the day. I highly recommend the fellas getting this for their wives, girlfriend, or mistresses! lol</li>
            <li> This smell very good. I like the light scent. This was a very good buy for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE - I have been wearing this perfume for a very long time and this was my first purchase of it through Amazon.  The smell does not seem to last very long, the appearance is a lot darker than that purchased in department stores and the box should have been wrapped in sealed plastic but this was not the case.  I wouldn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with this had I not paid department store price for a very questionable and likely knock-off perfume.  This was an absolute waste of money.</li>
            <li> Preteen niece loves Taylor Swift, so of course she loves the perfume. Smells nice- not too strong ( unless you pour it on).</li>
            <li> Wow I loved this one it&#x27;s smells so good will Definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle perfume and mature with a hint of vanilla. I also think the bottle is pretty. I just got it today for Christmas and I&#x27;m so so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she loved it!  For the last three years I have gotten her the new Taylor Swift Parfum and it has become a new tradition for us.  She loves all of her line and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Simply, the scent is just not for me.  Its a little sweet, which I normally love.  But there is something off.  Its too similar to other celebrity perfumes</li>
            <li> Great price for a large size.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T REALLY KNOW IF LOOKS COUNTS AS THOUSAND WORDS THEN SHE HAPPY WHEN SHE OPENED IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT</li>
            <li> it doesntr have the same smell like used to.</li>
            <li> She loves it. Her only negative was the bottle was so big... holds a lot... Smells AWESOME</li>
            <li> This is just scented water. Not real perfume.</li>
            <li> For those skeptical about buying from an amazon retailer instead of buying straight from Macy&#x27;s dept. store don&#x27;t be. I received the bottle quickly, in good condition, and it smells like a sweet summer scent. The other two taylor perfumes are more for fall/winter. I can&#x27;t tell how long the scent lasts--for some reason scents never seem to stick to my skin type:/ I&#x27;m glad I bought this at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I love the aroma. It&#x27;s like the juice of peaches and something else. The bottle is so nice!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this perfume.  It&#x27;s more suited to a younger wearer (perhaps a teen) than adult women.  The smell turned a cloying, overly-sweet smell on me - my husband even said it smelled like bug spray.  Try before you buy to see how it works on your skin.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest perfumes I ever smelled in my life!!!  Just one whiff could end a war........  RUSH to buy this - especially at the price!!!</li>
            <li> I think the smell of this perfume is awful. It smells like a mixture of an old lady perfume and dish soap. I&#x27;m not a fan. I was very disappointed because I liked Taylor&#x27;s Enchanted and Wonderstruck perfumes.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Not too overpowering. Subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Love it..third time I have purchased it! I receive so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love the scent at first I had trouble with how to get the top off but I get it now.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend this product to all women who loves soft fragrances.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample in a Christmas gift last year and I had to buy it. It smells SO good and I get asked constantly what brand I am wearing. The price here at Amazon can not be beat! It arrived a day early and the packaging is beautiful. Will buy again once I run out which may be a while because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Part of my daughter&#x27;s Christmas presents - she loved it.</li>
            <li> i got this for Christmas, and i love it. i am 12 years old and my friends love this too. its different from all the other Taylor perfumes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love this product by the first time I&#x27;ve seen it. Very good smel, it looks so beautiful and I will continue to choose it next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent and received quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an imposter.  So bummed</li>
            <li> Smells so good I got it before the date it gave me two day shipping Yay</li>
            <li> My wife was thinking about buying it and I just thought it would make a nice gift. She loves it, as I do......</li>
            <li> The product was at a good price, and it was received in time.</li>
            <li> awsome smell and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Finally a perfume my man can smell, that doesn&#x27;t wear off and is long lasting! I love all Taylor Swift perfumes but this is my favorite. This was the first time buying a celebrity&#x27;s perfume and I am never going back!</li>
            <li> This smells so good! I really like the fruity and sweet smell.I have the roller ball version which is cheaper and works just as well. ( You just don&#x27;t get a pretty bottle.) I found the roller ball at Ulta.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite frangrances its very soft and feminine. Great for daily wear, especially work. I&#x27;ve received many compliments</li>
            <li> Nice smelling perfume.  Bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised. Love how it smells on my wife. But smells better on my GF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this perfume since I used a magazine sample.  I loved the light, fruit/flowery fragrance.  The only reason for 4 stars is I used it pregnant, and it smelt great with my pregnant chemistry.  Not pregnant chemistry combines with this to make it slightly musky which is still good.  My husband loves it, and I still like it a lot.  ♥</li>
            <li> This really is the Taylor Swift perfume.........not some knock-off!!</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for Burberry&#x27;s ETP for woman for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Probably more subtle as well which is nice for a summer evening. Will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the sample I loved the fact that it lasted the entire day. Once I tried this one it only lasts a maybe 4 hrs</li>
            <li> Great product.  Any lady would love to have this in her collection of fine scents. Good price for the product too.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper in than in the stores and you get a big bottle however the scent for me doesn&#x27;t last too long it smells very good but the store version lasts longer and this one smells like its been watered down somewhat. Would definitely buy again but the store version is better. In fact I have it saved in my orders so I can buy it again fairly soon.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.Just didn&#x27;t last quite as long as I thought it would. I could still smell it a couple of hours after I had put it on.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance great price my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME SMELL SOOOOOOO GOOD I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Best deal anywhere for this perfume. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> Tried it in the store and smelled wonderful.  The one I ordered has absolutely no scent. Like spraying water. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My fiancée loves this scent and so do I. Great scent! It is sweet and lucious. Great for sexy time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Purchased it from Amazon because I trust them more than an independent seller (when it comes to buying perfume). I was completely surprised by how much I love it because I do not normally go for perfumes created by &amp;#34;stars.&amp;#34; This is my second favorite perfume to D&amp;G Light Blue. I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this new Taylor Swift perfume scent, but I am not impressed with the bottle.  I had to man-handle the stopper off because it did not come off easily...and then due to that, somehow the multi-colored disc that was poorly glued to the actual bottle became loose.  There was no way to screw it back to the bottle, which made actually trying to use the bottle difficult, so I pulled it off hoping it would be more sound underneath.  But no, the spray nozzle is very ill-fitting as well.  I will probably have to transfer the perfume to a different bottle all together just so I don&#x27;t accidentally knock it over and fifty dollars of perfume doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.  Not impressed--the other perfume bottles weren&#x27;t so cheaply made.  Anyone else have issues or was mine just a defect?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume by Taylor Swift. It is light and has a sweet smell to it, but it is not overwhelming. Sometimes I have not been able to smell it on me later on in the day, but my husband or others have noticed it so I know it lasts long. Definitely a good perfume to wear and I will be continuing to purchase her perfumes in the future. I have also tried her Wonderstruck perfume which I love as well.</li>
            <li> OMG. SMELL SO GOOD WOMEN U MUST BYE THIS ONE OOOOOOMMMMGGGGG.  GOOD</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product, but than she loves Taylor Swift too!</li>
            <li> I baught from PerfumeWorld and their shipping is fast. I live in Hawaii so Considering how far that is and it arriving fast, is very impressive. I ordered Someday by JB, Nude by Rhianna, and Selena Gomez one. This and the Gomez if byfar my favorite. When you first spray it, its very strong and floraly and very suffisticates amd feminine. Then when it lasts longer, its very relaxing to smell. Very addicting. I think I smelled the fregrance right off of my shirt :P Im just kidding. But I believe I sprayed it on at aroung 11 in the morning and right now its 6:43 PM. I wore it out and considering how hot it is outside here in Hawaii, the perfume stayed on until now and it smells great. Its very sweet and vanilla-y in the end. I also layered it with Pink Sugar just now and the combination is just sooo AMAZING. I am 16 and I get headaches very easily due to my super sensitive nose but at first it is strong. I mean I think all perfumes and fragrances are like that but this one is just a tad softer to the nose if you know what I mean. Overall, I love this and I will be  ordering more when I run out. I ordered the 3.4oz because it was such a good deal and I havent smelt this before.... I just baught it due to the reviews and I LOVE IT. I definetly reccomend. If you are thinking twice, dont!! Im totally hooked onto it. Its very very feminine and fresh. Very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I originally smelled this in a magazine.  I bought it first from ulta.  It smells sooo amazing and I get so many compliments on it and that i smell wonderful.  So I am ordering more :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is a lot stronger than the one I&#x27;m used to wearing. One spray is totally enough to last the day. I LOVE the scent, It&#x27;s warm and sweet, without being over spiced. I don&#x27;t really love the shape or design of the bottle, and the ring of pearls around the cap flies off every time I open it, but that&#x27;s just me nit-picking. I&#x27;ll probably buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated. Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Came in very good condition. 5 stars</li>
            <li> My girl smells great when she puts this on. You know man loves a gOod smelling gurl and it last the whole day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume name brand buyer. I usually always go for the knock-offs but after smelling and wanting Wonderstruck by Taylor Swift a few years ago, I was hooked on that perfume and it was given to me as a gift and I still love it. When I saw that she had another that was out called Enchanted and was in a similar looking bottle, I had planned on getting that one but the smell of it was very similar to Wonderstruck in my opinion. When I saw that there was a NEW fragrance called Taylor out, I was excited but had yet to see the magazine inserts that allow you to smell the fragrance. Finally when I got my recent magazine, they had an insert and upon first whiff, I was hooked and went home and decided to purchase it immediately and purchased it on amazon instead of ulta.com since it was cheaper. The bottle is huge in a good way. I now know the difference between 1.7 oz (that I&#x27;d gotten Wonderstruck in) and 3.4 oz.(that I&#x27;ve gotten Taylor in) It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle as well and I&#x27;ve received MANY compliments on this perfume as I did Wonderstruck. But I have to say that I love this one even more. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> Happy with the quality. Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Its a great smelling perfume! It does slowly fade throughout the day but you get a huge bottle so just reapply. It is not a very strong perfume but it is distinct thats why I like it so much. In the stores its over $35 so this is a good deal! It&#x27;s not fake I don&#x27;t know why people say that but they are wrong. Same package same bottle and the same smell. My friend bought it for over $40 and I bought it here and guess what they smell the same! If you&#x27;re looking for a unique smelling perfume then buy this!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Best one of her 3 perfumes!</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity that you get!</li>
            <li> The first thing I look at is the bottle. I am a massive fan of Taylor and had bought her previous bottles. This bottle was different and in a disappointing way. I don&#x27;t like how it looks at all. I had to deduct a star for that. I&#x27;ve heard that this scent smelled a lot like Jessica simpson&#x27;s perfume but I wouldn&#x27;t know, however I did get a compliment saying it smelled like I was wearing Burberry women&#x27;s perfume. At first I hated how it smelled like. It is definitely sweet and I can really smell the lychee note. I thought I was going to get migraines from this scent but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. It actually grew on me and I come to love this scent. It is very long lasting and a little does go a long way! Had a couple of compliments saying I smelled good. I think this scent is more of 18-20 year olds. It&#x27;s a little mature for high schoolers but still has that tiny youthful scent to it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, best scent ever!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the price is great compared to what it cost at the mall but the scent does not last long at all. I tried a sample at the mall and it lasted all day, I also read all the reviews saying the scent lasted all day so I decided to order it instead of paying twice as much for a bottle half the size. The bottle I got must not be the same thing because I can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on within an hour of putting it on. Very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! A warm vanilla smell. I bought one and loved it so much I bought another right away</li>
            <li> My wife loved this for her late Christmas present. I would have given 5 stars but I turned out to be allergic to it so I bumped it down to 4</li>
            <li> Smelled this perfume in a magazine ad.  Went to Macy&#x27;s to purchase it and could not justify spending that much money on myself around the holidays, so I left without it even though I loved it!  Saw it on Amazon a while after the holidays and decided to purchase it.  Best decision I could have made--this is a great scent that stays with you!</li>
            <li> Did what I needed it to do. A gift that was just what the end user asked for. She was very pleased</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I bought this for my &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; daughter as a gift. However, I now find myself sneaking into her room to use this at least once a week. I&#x27;m a bit of a perfume snob, and I have to say, this has become one of my favorite scents. My sister-in-law even noticed it and asked what I was wearing. She bought a bottle the next day!</li>
            <li> I turned 22 this year and have been a huge Taylor Swift fan since she started her career at age 16. When Taylor first started making perfume, I went out and bought her Wonderstruck. I skipped on the Enchanted because I didn&#x27;t like it as much. Then she released this perfume-Amazing! My Mom and I first saw it at Macy&#x27;s and got a little test strip of it and loved it, but it was too expensive there. I then splurged for my birthday and bought the 1.7 oz bottle at Ulta, which was still pretty expensive. I should&#x27;ve checked on Amazon first.. it&#x27;s $30 cheaper here! Anyways, I know nothing about how perfumes are made and what scents it&#x27;s made out of, but it stays on all day and I have gotten lots of compliments and when I say it&#x27;s by Taylor Swift people don&#x27;t believe me! I do agree with other people who have had trouble getting the top of the bottle off, but other than that I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> the wife loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> Smell great I love how cute the bottle is.A must have ladies.</li>
            <li> Crap. Product has either been completely altered or its expired. The color of the perfume is different than the one I currently owned from Macy&#x27;s. Wish I could give zero stars. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE - I bought this scent after smelling it on my manager at work.  It is amazing on her!  When I wore it to the office after receiving it, I got a lot of negative feedback.  I brought in the bottle for my manger to smell to see if maybe I had purchased the wrong kind of scent.  She said the bottle looks the same as hers (bought at kohl&#x27;s) but the liquid in hers is much lighter and clearer (more like a white color).  My bottle came in as a darker yellow liquid.  I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle for what exactly the deal is here, but this smells awful and nothing at all like what it should smell like.  I feel like I took 30 something dollars and threw them out the window, VERY dissappointed.</li>
            <li> love this perfume. I rarely, better yet never buy perfume from entertainers but Taylor Swift has nailed it with this one, will purchase another one soon</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.. My Granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and I was very happy with my purchase. Great size for a great price. Much more affordable than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked. Thank you so much! Def. recommend .</li>
            <li> Great everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed to be buying Taylor Swift perfume, but honestly it smells SO GOOD! All of my coworkers comment on it every time I wear it, and the scent is subtle without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great product! This company is awesome!</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail yesterday!! I&#x27;m in love with this scent! Love everything Taylor Swift does!!! I highly recommend this perfume and to anyone who is thinking about getting it should order this one on amazon!! BEST DEAL EVER!</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe how big this bottle is for the price, it&#x27;s mind blowing because when I used to buy it in the stores it was $22 for this tiny little bottle that made me feel like a giant when I held it. This bottle is huge! And yes it is the same perfume you would buy in the store this is NOT a knock off. It has a very beautiful rich but soft vanilla smell to it, it&#x27;s almost seductive. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume, both men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. The staying power of this perfume is just incredible, just a few spritz and it&#x27;s there til you shower. I will absolutely buy this again and women if you&#x27;re looking to just drive men wild I suggest you buy this too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I meant to rate it a five star I love it ! I&#x27;m always getting compliments ,I&#x27;m getting ready to order another bottle so that I won&#x27;t run out,)thank you.;)</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it!</li>
            <li> Perfume did not seem real ...was not the right color ....and did not smell the same</li>
