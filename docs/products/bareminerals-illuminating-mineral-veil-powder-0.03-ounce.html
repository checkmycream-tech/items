            <li>my face has cleared...never looked better.  </li>

            <li>I have used this for years and love the mineral veil illuminating.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkle it adds to my face.</li>
            <li>I look fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite daytime mineral veil.</li>
            <li>I love Bareminerals, this product is just okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 5 years and highly recommend it as a great concealer.  </li>
            <li>Now I love this even better than the original Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li>This gives a nice fresh glow after putting on the foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>but since I love the original I never had any doubts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine; I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li>There are great and easy recipes online to make your own mineral veil (illuminating or not) for just a few bucks.</li>
            <li>This seller is fantastic and the product is always as described.</li>
            <li>This powder is so light that we are breathing this stuff into our lungs.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh look it gives.</li>
            <li>The Mineral Veil sets the foundation and gives a smooth look and feel.  </li>
            <li>it keeps my face shine free and fresh ALL day :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy a set (the first time)</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have time for foundation, I quickly brush this on, and it gives my skin a special appearance.  </li>
            <li>In the right light, I look like I&#x27;m glowing...</li>
            <li>I loved this, long gone now.  </li>
            <li>It has to be used sparingly or you&#x27;ll look a bit too sparkly, but you&#x27;ll quickly learn just the right amount to use.  </li>
            <li>nice a sheer with just the right amount of cover up.</li>
            <li>By far this is one of my top 5 make up items in my collection, which is rather large collection!</li>
            <li>, this is the right stuff for you.</li>
            <li>so you can let the right amount out.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>I otherwise love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals been wearing it for years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
            <li>Works great as usual.</li>
            <li>I have so many compliments about being photogenic and this definitely helps.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>That way you know exactly what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li>This is important to me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so on second thought, it may be just the thing for kids in love with the Twilight vampires...or &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; dancers...</li>
            <li>I especially like the feature of opening up the powder inside with the twist top which opens holes</li>
            <li>Always loved mineral veil, now it has a slight sparkle!  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use too much, however, its pretty sparkly.</li>
            <li>Love this powder and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Saved much more than from buying directly from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those people who kind of has super neutral, maybe even dull skin (even with makeup)</li>
            <li>I have used the original Bare Escentuals mineral veil and I prefer that.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE MINERAL VEIL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light as a feather,and a simple dusting is all</li>
            <li>so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really takes the shine out of my T-zone and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Very translucent.</li>
            <li>that really</li>
            <li>I apply it with my blush brush, and occasionally use it as a light eye shadow to brighten my eyes a bit.  </li>
            <li>This product is really glittery (which I think is why they advertise it as illuminating?).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s true nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>when you get older the powder settles in yr wrinkles and really makes them show up....</li>
            <li>That would be all great because, hey, I saved myself some money- quite a bit less than what I&#x27;d pay at department store or the official web site, HOWEVER, what most of you most likely DO NOT realize is that these counterfeit products (usually manufactured in China) contain EXTREMELY harmful ingredients that you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely for use when you have full makeupâ€“without additional makeup, it can be a bit sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product  previously and am pleased</li>
            <li>The print was off to the left on the top of the container and looked different from what I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Used this product for years, couldn&#x27;t find supplier at new home</li>
            <li>I took a chance in purchasing this new product.  </li>
            <li>I wear the new Bare Skin foundation and really like it, as well as the new Complexion Rescue, otherwise known as a BB cream.  </li>
            <li>It draws a little light to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a government executive, and this product did not give me the professional look I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>It puts the finishing touches on your makeup that you need to look professional.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clog pores, doesn&#x27;t look heavy, feels light.</li>
            <li>Rather have the matte finish, I&#x27;m to old to use this illuminating type.  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>the mineral veil is my final touch in just making my skin tone even and ready for the day</li>
            <li>then you can close it back up so as not to get too much powder out at a time.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, you can&#x27;t buy a better similar product for the price.</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging reeked of cigarette smoke and the product, which was what I ordered, seemed to be old because it was dry not the moist foundation that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li>That or spend the few extra bucks buying from a reputable store or the Bare Minerals web site</li>
            <li>The subtle sparkle this gives one is stunning.</li>
            <li>I use all bare essentials!!</li>
            <li>I decided to go online in search of information on the difference between the real bare minerals and the fakes.</li>
            <li>I really like Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil as it is very similar to Bare Minerals products.  </li>
            <li>This powder is very light, covers well without being heavy, and has a slight shimmer to it without looking like</li>
            <li>I have used bare essentials for years and just started buying it through amazon.</li>
            <li>Again Bare Minerals never disappoints.  </li>
            <li>If you wear Bare Minerals and have not tried this it is a must have.</li>
            <li>Try it ladies over the Bare Minerals SPF foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil for years.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals Mineral make-up (foundation) all the time.  </li>
            <li>I have found that I can get it here much cheaper than other places.  </li>
            <li>I USE SEVERAL BARE MINERAL PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil stands above anything  </li>
            <li>It has a slight shimmer to it but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Just a touch gives you that slight shimmer without being too much.</li>
            <li>I typed in &amp;#34;Spotting fake bare minerals mineral veil&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking out for us girls:)</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who kind of has super neutral, maybe even dull skin (even with makeup)</li>
            <li> I have used the original Bare Escentuals mineral veil and I prefer that.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE MINERAL VEIL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light as a feather,and a simple dusting is all</li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really takes the shine out of my T-zone and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very translucent.</li>
            <li> that really</li>
            <li> I apply it with my blush brush, and occasionally use it as a light eye shadow to brighten my eyes a bit.  </li>
            <li> This product is really glittery (which I think is why they advertise it as illuminating?).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s true nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> when you get older the powder settles in yr wrinkles and really makes them show up....</li>
            <li> That would be all great because, hey, I saved myself some money- quite a bit less than what I&#x27;d pay at department store or the official web site, HOWEVER, what most of you most likely DO NOT realize is that these counterfeit products (usually manufactured in China) contain EXTREMELY harmful ingredients that you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely for use when you have full makeupâ€“without additional makeup, it can be a bit sparkly.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product  previously and am pleased</li>
            <li> The print was off to the left on the top of the container and looked different from what I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years, couldn&#x27;t find supplier at new home</li>
            <li> I took a chance in purchasing this new product.  </li>
            <li> I wear the new Bare Skin foundation and really like it, as well as the new Complexion Rescue, otherwise known as a BB cream.  </li>
            <li> It draws a little light to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a government executive, and this product did not give me the professional look I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> It puts the finishing touches on your makeup that you need to look professional.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clog pores, doesn&#x27;t look heavy, feels light.</li>
            <li> Rather have the matte finish, I&#x27;m to old to use this illuminating type.  </li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> the mineral veil is my final touch in just making my skin tone even and ready for the day</li>
            <li> then you can close it back up so as not to get too much powder out at a time.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, you can&#x27;t buy a better similar product for the price.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging reeked of cigarette smoke and the product, which was what I ordered, seemed to be old because it was dry not the moist foundation that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> That or spend the few extra bucks buying from a reputable store or the Bare Minerals web site</li>
            <li> The subtle sparkle this gives one is stunning.</li>
            <li> I use all bare essentials!!</li>
            <li> I decided to go online in search of information on the difference between the real bare minerals and the fakes.</li>
            <li> I really like Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil as it is very similar to Bare Minerals products.  </li>
            <li> This powder is very light, covers well without being heavy, and has a slight shimmer to it without looking like</li>
            <li> I have used bare essentials for years and just started buying it through amazon.</li>
            <li> Again Bare Minerals never disappoints.  </li>
            <li> If you wear Bare Minerals and have not tried this it is a must have.</li>
            <li> Try it ladies over the Bare Minerals SPF foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil for years.  </li>
            <li> I use Bare Escentuals Mineral make-up (foundation) all the time.  </li>
            <li> I have found that I can get it here much cheaper than other places.  </li>
            <li> I USE SEVERAL BARE MINERAL PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil stands above anything  </li>
            <li> It has a slight shimmer to it but not too much.  </li>
            <li> Just a touch gives you that slight shimmer without being too much.</li>
            <li> I typed in &amp;#34;Spotting fake bare minerals mineral veil&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking out for us girls:)</li>
            <li> So sheer, but with just the right amount of sparkle that hardly shows until you&#x27;re in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Many of them have been tested and had been found to contain traces of lead, caustic cleansing agents, and other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product for women &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; and certainly it&#x27;s the wrong product for me.</li>
            <li> when there&#x27;s blemishes on wall use the flat paint to hide blemishes.  </li>
            <li> My male co-workers think I look strange, but who cares?</li>
            <li> I will never use any other type of make-up now besides bare minerals!</li>
            <li> To all of you that are thinking of buying this or any other bare minerals product here on Amazon, please think twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical w/how glittery it looked, but it&#x27;s more matte once applied.</li>
            <li> What I received is absolutely, without a doubt, a complete fake.</li>
            <li> with a single brush on, my face looked like I&#x27;d melted plastic on my face.</li>
            <li> if you have a slight shine to your face by the end of the day i DEFINITELY recommend getting the mineral veil!</li>
            <li> I used to use Raw Natural Beauty&#x27;s Active Veil</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have changed is to make it a little less white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to get new make-up...and wasted so much money and my skin would always break out...and the make-up looked fake and caked on.  </li>
            <li> JUST GIVES YOU A LITTLE EXTRA GLOW BUT NOT LIKE GLITTER.</li>
            <li> Careful-</li>
            <li> I like the sparkle, not much, just a touch!  </li>
            <li> due to the cost of these products, i will use and bear it.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I usually order the regular mineral veil.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted a finishing powder to add a subtle shimmer, rather I got powdered plastic reminiscent of car oil over water.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that illuminating means that it contains little flecks of glitter.  </li>
            <li> Gives a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> It is &amp;#34;illuminating&amp;#34; so it does make your skin a little shiny.</li>
            <li> It is a little sparkly</li>
            <li> this product gives a little glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t risk your health and safety in order to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Used too heavily, you can look sparkly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my mineral powder for at least 3 years now, and it makes me look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least every 3-6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for illuminating products but to me that doesn&#x27;t mean shimmer.  </li>
            <li> the subtle shimmer was mesmerizing...until I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my $$$.  </li>
            <li> What the hell is the purpose for illuminating if we are trying to fight that aspect, DUH!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not a great match for anyone who has skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used from this line.  </li>
            <li> It was what I wanted but the bottom came off the container so the product went all over which made me mad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s since been discontinued. :(</li>
            <li> It looked awful and accentuated every line and crease on my face!  </li>
            <li> But this powder just looked awful.  </li>
            <li> This powder has to be the WORST BM product ever.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this is beyond the worst product every invented for you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPLURGES! I USE SEVERAL BARE MINERAL PRODUCTS. I REALLY LIKE THE MINERAL VEIL. IT REALLY GIVES YOU A FLAWLESS FINISH. THEN I FOUND THE ILLUMINATING MINERAL VEIL AND I LIKE IT EVEN BETTER. JUST GIVES YOU A LITTLE EXTRA GLOW BUT NOT LIKE GLITTER.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have found that I can get it here much cheaper than other places.  It has a slight shimmer to it but not too much.  Goes on great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that illuminating means that it contains little flecks of glitter.  I&#x27;m a government executive, and this product did not give me the professional look I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> This stuff has sparkles in it!  Eww!  I didn&#x27;t realize this before purchasing it, but I noticed it immediately when I looked in the mirror.  Egads!  It looked awful and accentuated every line and crease on my face!  It&#x27;s by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used from this line.  I otherwise love Bare Minerals.  I wear the new Bare Skin foundation and really like it, as well as the new Complexion Rescue, otherwise known as a BB cream.  Both are excellent products that I use nearly every day.  But this powder just looked awful.  I can&#x27;t imagine who would want a sparkly face.  I&#x27;m all for illuminating products but to me that doesn&#x27;t mean shimmer.  Georgio Armani Luminous foundation manages to make me glow without any shimmer at all.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s true nonetheless.  This powder has to be the WORST BM product ever.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my $$$.  I&#x27;ll stick with the foundation, BB cream and the blushes (which are awesome btw) and leave the rest to others.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for women &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; and certainly it&#x27;s the wrong product for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who kind of has super neutral, maybe even dull skin (even with makeup), this is the right stuff for you. I&#x27;ve been using it as my mineral powder for at least 3 years now, and it makes me look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely for use when you have full makeupâ€“without additional makeup, it can be a bit sparkly.  Great to set your existing makeup, fight any shine, or to just illuminate and brighten up a part of your face (kind of like a very very light highlighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it for every photoshoot and video event I have to go to, as that can be a part of my job.  It makes me look flawless, and I can certainly tell the difference when I go without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not a great match for anyone who has skin that&#x27;s darker than a medium tone, however.</li>
            <li> I believe if something makes you feel beautiful you should keep it in your life.&lt;br /&gt;This I shall keep. It&#x27;s light as a feather,and a simple dusting is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;It is just wonderful,I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and highly recommend it as a great concealer.  It puts the finishing touches on your makeup that you need to look professional.  What I like now is how they made a plastic applicator that opens and closes so you can let the right amount out.</li>
            <li> great product , perfect transaction</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on this, because I absolutely love this product. You know how some people won&#x27;t leave the house without their mascara or lipstick on? Well, this is how I feel about my illuminating mineral veil. I love how it makes my skin look. It gives my face this ethereal essence. I have people tell me my skin looks flawless and some that think my skin in porcelain. I am 35 and I think it makes me look a bit younger. I love how my photographs come out with this on. I have so many compliments about being photogenic and this definitely helps. I am never without my illuminating mineral veil. Also it lasts for quite a while. By far this is one of my top 5 make up items in my collection, which is rather large collection! ;)</li>
            <li> i love this stuff! goes on great after using the bareminerals foundation, its really the icing on the cake. don&#x27;t use too much, however, its pretty sparkly. especially in bright light. a little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  Gives a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it gives your skin a flawless look when applied over the foundation. The closer store to purchase for me is 45 mins away so ordering online saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for about 6 years.  I love how they go on and stay all day. long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough. This is the sparkly \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; mineral veil, not the regular one. It&#x27;s fine; I&#x27;ll keep it. But just a head&#x27;s up: I look like Edward Cullen in the sunshine.</li>
            <li> Always loved mineral veil, now it has a slight sparkle!  I like the sparkle, not much, just a touch!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used bare essentials for years and just started buying it through amazon. This seller is fantastic and the product is always as described. if you have a slight shine to your face by the end of the day i DEFINITELY recommend getting the mineral veil! it keeps my face shine free and fresh ALL day :)</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves this product so I get it for her from time to time....I don&#x27;t use it myself because of my age...when you get older the powder settles in yr wrinkles and really makes them show up....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clog pores, doesn&#x27;t look heavy, feels light. I didn&#x27;t break out from wearing it. So yeah Bare escentuals makeup is one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> Great to dust on over the top of everything.  Just a touch gives you that slight shimmer without being too much.</li>
            <li> WARNING!!!!  To all of you that are thinking of buying this or any other bare minerals product here on Amazon, please think twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product not giving it a second thought from FineBeauty. I just received it 30 minutes ago and realized there was something off about the packaging. The print was off to the left on the top of the container and looked different from what I&#x27;m use to. It&#x27;s close, but not close enough. I decided to go online in search of information on the difference between the real bare minerals and the fakes. What I received is absolutely, without a doubt, a complete fake. That would be all great because, hey, I saved myself some money- quite a bit less than what I&#x27;d pay at department store or the official web site, HOWEVER, what most of you most likely DO NOT realize is that these counterfeit products (usually manufactured in China) contain EXTREMELY harmful ingredients that you can&#x27;t see. Many of them have been tested and had been found to contain traces of lead, caustic cleansing agents, and other harmful chemicals. This powder is so light that we are breathing this stuff into our lungs. Please don&#x27;t risk your health and safety in order to save a few dollars. There are great and easy recipes online to make your own mineral veil (illuminating or not) for just a few bucks. That way you know exactly what&#x27;s in it. That or spend the few extra bucks buying from a reputable store or the Bare Minerals web site so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go online and find photos showing the difference between authentic and counterfeit products. I typed in &amp;#34;Spotting fake bare minerals mineral veil&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking out for us girls:)</li>
            <li> Used this product for years, couldn&#x27;t find supplier at new home so I ordered it from Amazon.  Perfect finishing powder for a soft look.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted but the bottom came off the container so the product went all over which made me mad.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals been wearing it for years and will continue to use it. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Again Bare Minerals never disappoints.  If you wear Bare Minerals and have not tried this it is a must have.</li>
            <li> I would not say that this is ideal for all skin tones.  It makes me look rather ghostly and it seems to soak in making my pores look larger.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil stands above anything  I&#x27;ve ever used for my combination skin. It really takes the shine out of my T-zone and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years.  It is the finishing touch which makes a difference.  If I don&#x27;t have time for foundation, I quickly brush this on, and it gives my skin a special appearance.  I have received many compliments on my skin since using this product.  This is important to me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Rather have the matte finish, I&#x27;m to old to use this illuminating type.  Just like paint for your walls,  when there&#x27;s blemishes on wall use the flat paint to hide blemishes.  Same seems to apply to this mineral  veil.  due to the cost of these products, i will use and bear it.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, you can&#x27;t buy a better similar product for the price. This powder is very light, covers well without being heavy, and has a slight shimmer to it without looking like I applied glitter to my face. Very translucent. Makes skin look better.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging reeked of cigarette smoke and the product, which was what I ordered, seemed to be old because it was dry not the moist foundation that I ordered.  I had to immediately order another one from another seller.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this is beyond the worst product every invented for you. What the hell is the purpose for illuminating if we are trying to fight that aspect, DUH!</li>
            <li> Great product that my wife loves. I wish I could find it cheaper for her. You pay for quality items.</li>
            <li> Not as I hoped. It is just Powder.ðŸ˜©</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals! I use this in the summer as a very light powder. It is &amp;#34;illuminating&amp;#34; so it does make your skin a little shiny. I would use the matte one if you are self-conscious about that.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other type of make-up now besides bare minerals! The illuminating Mineral Veil is now a mainstay in my make-up collection!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else...I&#x27;ve used the so called best make-up and payed high dollar on products I would need to get refills on.  At least every 3-6 months I&#x27;d have to get new make-up...and wasted so much money and my skin would always break out...and the make-up looked fake and caked on.  NOW, I only have to refill once a year...my face has cleared...never looked better.  People, say I have a glow and best part of all...they think I&#x27;m not wearing any make-up at all....WOW...Thank you Leslie Blodgett...for creating something that really works!...Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is great. I was a little skeptical w/how glittery it looked, but it&#x27;s more matte once applied. It is a little sparkly so I use this for evening and the regular mineral veil for day. This diminishes shine and keeps the rest of your make up place. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this line of makeup- nice finishing touch to foundation. Would buy again-I especially like the container it comes in.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years, and it&#x27;s all i wear. nice a sheer with just the right amount of cover up. the mineral veil is my final touch in just making my skin tone even and ready for the day</li>
            <li> This product looked perfect upon opening it. It&#x27;s snap lock lid is amazing and the subtle shimmer was mesmerizing...until I put it on. Swirl, tap, and with a single brush on, my face looked like I&#x27;d melted plastic on my face. The &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; comments were definitely NOT for this product. I use airbrush makeup which gives me a matte finish and I just wanted a finishing powder to add a subtle shimmer, rather I got powdered plastic reminiscent of car oil over water. I used to use Raw Natural Beauty&#x27;s Active Veil but it&#x27;s since been discontinued. :(</li>
            <li> Love the highlighting effect, brightens up my face</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! So sheer, but with just the right amount of sparkle that hardly shows until you&#x27;re in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Looks perfectly natural-wear it by itself like a second skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love the mineral veil illuminating. Doesn&#x27;t give you a sparkly look, but&lt;br /&gt;more illuminating.  Try it ladies over the Bare Minerals SPF foundation.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this a few years ago. I love the sparkle it adds to my face. My male co-workers think I look strange, but who cares? I look fabulous!</li>
            <li> This gives a nice fresh glow after putting on the foundation and blush. I love the fresh look it gives.</li>
            <li> I really like Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil as it is very similar to Bare Minerals products.  Gives a very smooth finish to the skin!</li>
            <li> it came in the mail very quick, the color looks very shiny, but actually it&#x27;s perfect, doesn&#x27;t look glittery or sparkly.</li>
            <li> I took a chance in purchasing this new product.  I was really skeptical at first but since I love the original I never had any doubts.  Now I love this even better than the original Mineral Veil.  I will definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I meant to order the standard mineral veil and accidentally bought this &amp;#34;illuminating&amp;#34; version.  Careful- its quite shiny.  In the right light, I look like I&#x27;m glowing...so on second thought, it may be just the thing for kids in love with the Twilight vampires...or &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; dancers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. Love it! It&#x27;s a great finish and gives a fine shimmer.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like my makeup is caked on.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It has to be used sparingly or you&#x27;ll look a bit too sparkly, but you&#x27;ll quickly learn just the right amount to use.  I apply it with my blush brush, and occasionally use it as a light eye shadow to brighten my eyes a bit.  I have fair skiing with pink-tones and some freckles - this product gives a little glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> The subtle sparkle this gives one is stunning. I especially like the feature of opening up the powder inside with the twist top which opens holes then you can close it back up so as not to get too much powder out at a time.</li>
            <li> This veil does a great job.  I would recommend it to anyone. Make sure to buy a set (the first time) so you&#x27;ll get a video on how to apply!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil for years.  I love this product and especially love the price I was able to get it for.  Saved much more than from buying directly from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things!  I use Bare Escentuals Mineral make-up (foundation) all the time.  The Mineral Veil sets the foundation and gives a smooth look and feel.  The minerals areactually good for your skin!!!</li>
            <li> Love Bare Escentuals products.  It is the only makeup line I use.</li>
            <li> Love this powder and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Works great as usual.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! This Is my second order and I buy 2 at a time</li>
            <li> I have used this product  previously and am pleased</li>
            <li> I loved this, long gone now.  The only thing I would have changed is to make it a little less white.</li>
            <li> Used sparingly, this feather-light powder adds a finishing touch to your face.  It draws a little light to your skin.  Used too heavily, you can look sparkly.  Apply  lightly for the perfect look.  This is my favorite daytime mineral veil.</li>
            <li> I love Bareminerals, this product is just okay. I usually order the regular mineral veil. I also have ordered the tinted mineral. I like the tinted but prefer the regular.</li>
            <li> I have used the original Bare Escentuals mineral veil and I prefer that. This product is really glittery (which I think is why they advertise it as illuminating?). If you are not into glitter, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I use all bare essentials!! I love the illuminating veil!! It helps blending and creates a really nice glow and makes everything look so blended! Recommend!</li>
