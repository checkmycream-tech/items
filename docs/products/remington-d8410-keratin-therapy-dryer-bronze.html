    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>My fianc√© was really happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>It is the best one I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my share of dryers, and this is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  </li>
            <li>Awesome and lightweight blow dryer.</li>
            <li>and this makes it perfect for me when I use my brush to help straighten out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This to me was an example of excellent customer service ---</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it over six months and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>However, this is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Ideal test subjects!  </li>
            <li>Excellent, very good.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT- EXCELLENT VALUE!!!</li>
            <li>All in all, this is as close to perfect as I can get, and I will happily take it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and if I can&#x27;t get what I want, I will settle very happily for this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>so I have great vacation hair too.</li>
            <li>The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is simply a great handheld dryer.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she seems to be happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great blow drier for the money.</li>
            <li>She was perfectly happy with the Ac2015 and did not want to change.</li>
            <li>in all, Remington is a great brand and both the Ac2015 and</li>
            <li>However, in my case an e-mail to Remington customer service yielded great results --I</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair dryer,</li>
            <li>in all a good dryer.</li>
            <li>Great light-weight, nicely designed dryer.</li>
            <li>Looks good even when not being used.</li>
            <li>But it seems good.</li>
            <li>now the D8410 deliver reliability, durability, and good results.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington Pearl blow dryer that I loved.</li>
            <li>so maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to try the keratin.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer about a dozen times with good results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still a good hair dryer, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not recommending it.  </li>
            <li>very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>
            <li>/&gt;And,  couple of things that could have been better, but still allow this to be a great purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very pleased.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s visually beautiful, with strong airflow and plenty of heat while being the quietest dryer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend for sure!</li>
            <li>Love this dryer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>drys well, and feels nice against your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I really liked that the manufacturer didn&#x27;t promise anything that it couldn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries on its own in about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get your hopes up for some kind of miracle from the keratin ring.  </li>
            <li>Although I strongly doubt that the keratin ring will make any difference in my hair, I love this hair dryer for its beautiful ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>great for the price...doesn&#x27;t get too hot, which is great for not burning my hair :) i would buy again...</li>
            <li>, but I&#x27;m gradually learning how to keep my hair from flying away when the dryer is on high, and honestly, my hair turns out looking wonderful</li>
            <li>Works great, no bad burning smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a powerful, great hair dryer-</li>
            <li>BUT: It is very light.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The ionic aspect is great, it adds so much body to my hair &amp; my hair is also shinier and softer.</li>
            <li>It has three heat sittings and two fan speeds, which will satisfy most people.</li>
            <li>Was glad I found it here</li>
            <li>Love the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of settings on this dryer.  </li>
            <li>but thought I would mention it for the more savvy buyers.</li>
            <li>If you have a plug in over the sink, you should be okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with their product but not with their nosiness.</li>
            <li>The reviews for this hair dryer are good, so I thought, it&#x27;s worth the wait for a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Being able to adjust both the temp and the airflow allows the diffuser to work</li>
            <li>I love Remington as a brand, and this dryer exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>also likes the color &amp; stylish look of it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>but my wife has not yet noticed any difference in a \\&quot;better shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Remington&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This model, though, is just okay ...</li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners and leave-in mousses and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend The Sharper Image travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and I&#x27;m sure you will too.</li>
            <li>For most of us, the code given on the coupon did not work when we went on-line to redeem it.</li>
            <li>One thing I did discover was that the wetter my hair was when I started drying it, the better the results were.  </li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li>I like the silver color as most of the dryers I have gotten seem to always be blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this.</li>
            <li>In many ways, hair dryers are commodities, like combs or paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neither of the lovely ladies in my life indicated noticing ANY difference in their hair.  </li>
            <li>This dryer meets all the criteria fairly well and appears to be just the right weight for me.  </li>
            <li>I received this hairdryer being very excited that it contained keratin.</li>
            <li>The keratin infusion is a marvelous attribute that leaves each dry job looking better and better.  </li>
            <li>It is very fast and very hot, so it does a wonderful job of drying hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Honestly, nothing special, but no complaints either.  </li>
            <li>There is a ring of Keratin at the nozzle, which is supposed to keep your hair strong, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>&quot; and its claim of a \\&quot;shiny, healthy finish\\&quot;; no one really noticed any difference in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good hair drier, seems durable</li>
            <li>This dryer does not get very hot - barely warm.</li>
            <li>the most important added option - the keratin ring on the end -</li>
            <li>In reading some reviews I found that many considered this hair dryer light weight.</li>
            <li>The Remington D8410 Keratin Dryer works great, but as far as the keratin therapy</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 3 heat speeds which are great- cool, lukewarm and hot, and in addition, there is a cool air shot.</li>
            <li>Dries the hair very quick.</li>
            <li>The drier is well balanced and easy to handle considering motor size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>There is a hanging loop and a removable air filter for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rocker-style buttons are easy to push.</li>
            <li>The buttons are easy to change without looking once you get used to knowing where they are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Large, easy to add diffuser leaves my wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>The buttons on the handle are easy to change but too easy.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer itself is easy to hold although it would not be easy to take traveling.</li>
            <li>If you want a hair dryer at home this is very adequate</li>
            <li>The airflow is strong and there&#x27;s plenty of heat.</li>
            <li>strong air flow</li>
            <li>That it seems is true to its description on the box.ge travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying</li>
            <li>light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The Remington D is efficient, quick and a bit quieter than most.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The Remington D-8410 hair dryer is the most powerful hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Included is a concentrator in the box and a coupon for a free diffuser.</li>
            <li>this one had such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>There was a coupon in the box with a code to get one free from their website</li>
            <li>I went to the website with my coupon from inside the box that says \\&quot;redeem your FREE diffuser at RemingtonProducts.com\\&quot;, put in the code</li>
            <li>You can send away for a free diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and the handle is comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A concentrator comes with the dryer and there is a coupon for a free diffuser in the box</li>
            <li>An airflow concentrator attachment is enclosed and a diffuser is available (at no charge) through the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>Is my hair perfectly smooth?  </li>
            <li>If you purchase this dryer and receive a coupon that gives you a free diffuser you need to know that you may have to contact Remington in order to receive that product.</li>
            <li>received an apology, a diffuser, and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Either way it works fast, nice control settings.</li>
            <li>so far so good, its powerful, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, I was pleased,</li>
            <li>Good, solid hairdryer, but I do wish it was just a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is it&#x27;s very light weight, compared to my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>Ideally, a wet to straight flat iron would be the best solution, but the really good ones are beyond my bank balance, and the one I tried managed to burn my scalp in three places without straightening my hair, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is super powerful and dries it thoroughly in about 5-7 minutes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion: Not a bad dryer, but nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how soft my hair is after blow drying it.  </li>
            <li>The dryer has 3 heat and 2 speed settings, plus a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to set the hair.  </li>
            <li>It has two drying speeds and three heat levels plus a separate button which shoots cool air to help set your style in place.  </li>
            <li>That it seems is true to its description on the box.</li>
            <li>I use this dryer on a regular basis and find it to be as indicated -- a good, reliable dryer.</li>
            <li>but this dryer makes quick work of it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the high setting- just checked to make sure it worked but</li>
            <li>I like this better than my old dryer, it is much lighter and has just as much or more power.</li>
            <li>Does it look almost 100% better than with a normal hair dryer?  </li>
            <li>As long as the compliments are blowing in the wind, she has her good hair</li>
            <li>Overall, a good dryer, but I have to admit I like my old one better.</li>
            <li>The price of this unit seems a bit high but being able to adjust the heat and blower settings is very handy and is kinder to my hair than my previous blow dryer.</li>
            <li>settings she likes very much(3 heat levels, 2 speeds) as the controls buttons are easy to move.&lt;br</li>
            <li>1875 Watts is powerful, and with multiple speed and heat settings you can get the perfect combination &amp; and quick dry</li>
            <li>I assume that Remington must have skimped on sound absorbing materials to reduce its weight, which doesn&#x27;t sit too well with me as I&#x27;d rather save my ears than my arms.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have owned some pretty nice dryers in the past but never any I liked as well as</li>
            <li>But it seems to be powerful.</li>
            <li>The setting that are possible by using different combinations of the switches make this a good choice for many types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Remington hairdryers and I find them to be good hairdryers that get the job done at a great price--often with the efficacy of more expensive hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>This is an underpowered hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t worth the time it took to unbox it.</li>
            <li>Far better options exist for this price point.</li>
            <li>seems to be too cool on my hair and the hot</li>
            <li>Firstly, it does a great job drying my hair, and it makes it soft and manageable,  and does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great-looking tool, very clean and professional.  </li>
            <li>Made a nice companion to the flat iron I also purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m irritated right now.  </li>
            <li>Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know the purpose of this since I have never had to clean the air filter of any of my hair dryers, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One feature that I really  like is the ability to take the air filter off and clean the dust out.</li>
            <li>dryer&#x27;s case is a beautiful pearlescent, light rose-tan color (not the gray shown in the product image above), and the switches are extremely easy-to-use toggles (rather than the hard-to-move sliders e.g. on the FastFinish).</li>
            <li>In her experience over many years, the electrical motor on blow dryers generally burn out within a couple of years.</li>
            <li>The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is lightweight, easy to use and, importantly, the outside case doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The fast speed is so powerful, I couldn&#x27;t take the loud sound of the fan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for several weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I could see the difference the first time I used it -</li>
            <li>The diffuser is not included in the box, but the company offers a free diffuser at their website.</li>
            <li>There was nothing in the box to more fully describe the benefits of the dryer &amp; ring, so all we have to go by are the basic claims on the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a couple of weeks and overall am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred for the second fan speed to be more of a medium flow rate,</li>
            <li>&#x27;shiny/smoothing gels\\&quot; but none of them work for more than the time it takes me to walk outside into heat and humidity!  </li>
            <li>thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li>noticed no difference in the strength or texture of my hair after using this, and I think the Keratin is more of a selling point than an actual feature that produces results.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t pretty or girly, but if you like products that work, you will like this one.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t pretty or girly, but if you like products that work, you will like this one.  </li>
            <li>Doing what, exactly?</li>
            <li>is too hot.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer blows hot air and dries the hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, quiet, and it get the  job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to dry your hair quickly with a 5 star dryer if you don&#x27;t mind the 2 downsides, which knock it down to 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li>The settings are very easy to adjust especially when you have only one free hand</li>
            <li>Drying was very fast and my hair certainly did seem shinier.  </li>
            <li>The enclosed nozzle helps direct the air more directly to the spots of hair you are drying, which results in a smoother look without taking away from the body of the hair.  </li>
            <li>The back of the dryer flips open so you can clean the filter which is very convenient and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>It only last a year, which was surprising, so I looked around to order another.</li>
            <li>Because I am male and keep my hair fairly short, I am far, far from the ideal audience for this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This one is also very easy to use, without all the extra buttons as other dryers, making it easy to adjust to one&#x27;s needs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the D8410 is slightly larger, it does not feel any heavier and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I have fine, chin length, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended is she has really long hair :)</li>
            <li>Easy to clean removable filter, after few months of use, it did collect a lot of dust and needed to be cleaned</li>
            <li>It dries her hair quicky so that she can get ready for work or recreation without much delay.</li>
            <li>There are 2 fan speeds- medium and powerfully fast.</li>
            <li>so you decide how much you would spend on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It comes with the concentrator only and has a coupon for a free diffuser.</li>
            <li>the lower and cold settings are great!</li>
            <li>really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just a matter of principle.  </li>
            <li>It really depends if I can figure out why it&#x27;s sucking up my hair and if I get a \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; diffuser.</li>
            <li>She has now been using the D8410 for over a month and loves it as much as she does her Ac2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no way for you to really tell if the keratin ring is doing anything or is just a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the Remington D8410 Keratin dryer because of the lightweight aspect as well as the force of the air pushed through.</li>
            <li>There is really one suggestion I have to improve the dryer.</li>
            <li>But the case material is inexpensive plastic, the motor seems lightweight, and the unit is very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Keratin hair dryer really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>concentrator really weakens the air flow and dries the hair very slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s just marketing.</li>
            <li>hair is very course</li>
            <li>This Keratin Dryer is fast, efficient and that is a plus for someone like me who is always on the go.</li>
            <li>I knew going into this that a hair dryer was not going to get my hair perfectly straight, and it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that qualifies me to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But in the end, there really isn&#x27;t all that much to say.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is heavy, nice quality.</li>
            <li>I am also having trouble with the heat setting as warm</li>
            <li>The color as shown on here is not accurate, it is more of a golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many options in terms of cold, cool, warm and a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot button depending on your hair style and type which offers flexibility of use.  </li>
            <li>It has a powerful 1875 watts motor (most other hair driers range from 1000 - 1500 watts); motor runs quiet and blows plenty of air; the ceramic radiant heater is strong and produces enough heat for fast drying.</li>
            <li>Since her hair is very shiny, light &amp; grey</li>
            <li>It is a real time saver and a delight, not to have to allow an hour plus just to get my hair dry and looking civilized.  </li>
            <li>Her Remington, the first she has owned, unlike others including professional dryers, has stood the test of time and continues to work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new hair dryer makes blow drying a breeze!</li>
            <li>The keratin actually really seems to be a legitimate thing - I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair looks every time I use this dryer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a tone of money on a hair dryer, but wanted a decent quality one.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of drying your hair as slow or as fast as you choose.</li>
            <li>3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image.</li>
            <li>3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I seem to be able to dry my hair twice as fast as I did with my older, big mouth dryer.</li>
            <li>Blow drying usually makes for a large volume of hair, and if you havea lot of volume to begin with, you don&#x27;t want more, trust me.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is the dryer is fairly loud however it does dry my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The Remington Keratin Dryer is a little larger than my other blow dryers, but this one is very light and you will love that about this dryer.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why that is important as one hair dryer seems like any other to me</li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer and did quite a bit of research before purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>This dryer heats up quickly and dries my hair so much faster than other dryers.</li>
            <li>The unit comes with features similar to the Ac2015 - multiple heat and speed settings - and some that are unique to the D8410 including a 1875w high torque motor for faster drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did dry my hair quickly</li>
            <li>the nozzles of this model and the T-Studio are the same size and the attachments fit both; the nozzle of the FastFinish model is larger.)</li>
            <li>This dryer is very, very loud.</li>
            <li>But what she is satisfied with, are the unasked for compliments at bus stops, shops, &amp; other public places.</li>
            <li>top heavy design - the motor/fan section is huge (a common problem, in my opinion, with many dryers) with a long neck, if you use the attachment, it becomes so long and unbalanced with its weight, that you might hit your head with the dryer&#x27;s end</li>
            <li>Smooths and manages my hair and dries it really fast with lasting results.</li>
            <li>I like the different heat &amp; airflow settings so you can choose how much you want to control during your styling process.</li>
            <li>we got a turbo one when the old one died, the turbo one always made the circuit breaker switch/outlet jump, not this one;&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>so I could have it shipped directly to the person I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer about 10 times so far.  </li>
            <li>With this dryer, unlike my old one, I can adjust settings of blower strength and heat to suit all my needs.  </li>
            <li>Two of my three young daughters have curly hair</li>
            <li>Not too loud, even though it is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I really like the idea that it is easy to clean the filter, as I have had multiple dryers that end up smelling like burnt hair because they are difficult to keep clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for the price Amazon offers it at...</li>
            <li>I have a old one I have been using and this one made a ton of difference while drying my hair</li>
            <li>as it was on my old dryer, a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but this dryer has my hair smoothed out just enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to flat-iron it as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the standard professional shape (not collapsible), the standard 1875 watts, with airflow options of low and high, and heat options of cool, warm, and hot (plus a button for a burst of cold).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous hair dryer that was cheaper, so my hair isn&#x27;t as straight</li>
            <li>Figuring out how to use it for styling has been a bit of a challenge, as the high fan speed is extremely fast, while the low fan speed is much too slow to be useful.</li>
            <li>Great random gift for your girl!</li>
            <li>I was previously using a Remington hairdryer from a big-box supermarket retailer which was doing an adequate job in drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you used the loud fast fan speed with the hottest heat setting, you wouldn&#x27;t be holding this for very long, so the heavier weight wouldn&#x27;t be a problem on your wrists.</li>
            <li>If you need power and like to dry your hair fast, and if you don&#x27;t mind a heavier dryer that is loud, this dryer is for you.</li>
            <li>The advertised \\&quot;FREE DIFFUSER availabe with included coupon\\&quot; IS NOT FREE!  </li>
            <li>so it usually takes a lot of time to smooth it out</li>
            <li>It is a very serviceable hair dryer, of average weight and with decent blowing power.  </li>
            <li>According to my three girls this hair dryer is really really loud compared to my old one as they cheer when \\&quot;you are finally done drying your hair!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>My hair was very soft AND manageable, at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I like using the concentrator in general, but if I had not taken it off out of curiosity, I would have given this a three stars, or fewer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a hearing problem, but this is simply too loud, as in-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything to my hair because I didn&#x27;t feel any changes, but that didn&#x27;t matter because my hair dried quicker and straighted out nicely.</li>
            <li>I must say that I have used dozens of hair dryers over the years and the main differences are size, how they feel in your hand, how hot they get and how hard they blow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy on my wrists and too loud on the fast fan speed.</li>
            <li>Each time my hair was soft and dry without the frizzy halo that a blow dryer generally produces.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever had a hair dryer this powerful (1875 W)</li>
            <li>The keratin-infused nozzle ring looks like an ordinary plastic ring at the end of the nozzle and I&#x27;m not convinced that it makes a huge difference in the end result, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do anything negative.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that the keratin therapy is doing anything for my hair as I have yet to notice a significant difference between this hair dry and my last hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is fairly large as it will not fit into my cabinet drawer.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My fianc√© was really happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> It is the best one I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my share of dryers, and this is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  </li>
            <li> Awesome and lightweight blow dryer.</li>
            <li> and this makes it perfect for me when I use my brush to help straighten out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This to me was an example of excellent customer service ---</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it over six months and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> However, this is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Ideal test subjects!  </li>
            <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT- EXCELLENT VALUE!!!</li>
            <li> All in all, this is as close to perfect as I can get, and I will happily take it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product and if I can&#x27;t get what I want, I will settle very happily for this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> so I have great vacation hair too.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is simply a great handheld dryer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she seems to be happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow drier for the money.</li>
            <li> She was perfectly happy with the Ac2015 and did not want to change.</li>
            <li> in all, Remington is a great brand and both the Ac2015 and</li>
            <li> However, in my case an e-mail to Remington customer service yielded great results --I</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer,</li>
            <li> in all a good dryer.</li>
            <li> Great light-weight, nicely designed dryer.</li>
            <li> Looks good even when not being used.</li>
            <li> But it seems good.</li>
            <li> now the D8410 deliver reliability, durability, and good results.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington Pearl blow dryer that I loved.</li>
            <li> so maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to try the keratin.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer about a dozen times with good results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good hair dryer, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not recommending it.  </li>
            <li> very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>
            <li> /&gt;And,  couple of things that could have been better, but still allow this to be a great purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very pleased.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s visually beautiful, with strong airflow and plenty of heat while being the quietest dryer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> drys well, and feels nice against your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I really liked that the manufacturer didn&#x27;t promise anything that it couldn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries on its own in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get your hopes up for some kind of miracle from the keratin ring.  </li>
            <li> Although I strongly doubt that the keratin ring will make any difference in my hair, I love this hair dryer for its beautiful ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> great for the price...doesn&#x27;t get too hot, which is great for not burning my hair :) i would buy again...</li>
            <li> , but I&#x27;m gradually learning how to keep my hair from flying away when the dryer is on high, and honestly, my hair turns out looking wonderful</li>
            <li> Works great, no bad burning smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a powerful, great hair dryer-</li>
            <li> BUT: It is very light.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The ionic aspect is great, it adds so much body to my hair &amp; my hair is also shinier and softer.</li>
            <li> It has three heat sittings and two fan speeds, which will satisfy most people.</li>
            <li> Was glad I found it here</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of settings on this dryer.  </li>
            <li> but thought I would mention it for the more savvy buyers.</li>
            <li> If you have a plug in over the sink, you should be okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with their product but not with their nosiness.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this hair dryer are good, so I thought, it&#x27;s worth the wait for a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Being able to adjust both the temp and the airflow allows the diffuser to work</li>
            <li> I love Remington as a brand, and this dryer exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> also likes the color &amp; stylish look of it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> but my wife has not yet noticed any difference in a \\&quot;better shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Remington&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This model, though, is just okay ...</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners and leave-in mousses and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend The Sharper Image travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and I&#x27;m sure you will too.</li>
            <li> For most of us, the code given on the coupon did not work when we went on-line to redeem it.</li>
            <li> One thing I did discover was that the wetter my hair was when I started drying it, the better the results were.  </li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li> I like the silver color as most of the dryers I have gotten seem to always be blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this.</li>
            <li> In many ways, hair dryers are commodities, like combs or paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither of the lovely ladies in my life indicated noticing ANY difference in their hair.  </li>
            <li> This dryer meets all the criteria fairly well and appears to be just the right weight for me.  </li>
            <li> I received this hairdryer being very excited that it contained keratin.</li>
            <li> The keratin infusion is a marvelous attribute that leaves each dry job looking better and better.  </li>
            <li> It is very fast and very hot, so it does a wonderful job of drying hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Honestly, nothing special, but no complaints either.  </li>
            <li> There is a ring of Keratin at the nozzle, which is supposed to keep your hair strong, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> &quot; and its claim of a \\&quot;shiny, healthy finish\\&quot;; no one really noticed any difference in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good hair drier, seems durable</li>
            <li> This dryer does not get very hot - barely warm.</li>
            <li> the most important added option - the keratin ring on the end -</li>
            <li> In reading some reviews I found that many considered this hair dryer light weight.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Dryer works great, but as far as the keratin therapy</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 3 heat speeds which are great- cool, lukewarm and hot, and in addition, there is a cool air shot.</li>
            <li> Dries the hair very quick.</li>
            <li> The drier is well balanced and easy to handle considering motor size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> There is a hanging loop and a removable air filter for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rocker-style buttons are easy to push.</li>
            <li> The buttons are easy to change without looking once you get used to knowing where they are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Large, easy to add diffuser leaves my wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> The buttons on the handle are easy to change but too easy.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself is easy to hold although it would not be easy to take traveling.</li>
            <li> If you want a hair dryer at home this is very adequate</li>
            <li> The airflow is strong and there&#x27;s plenty of heat.</li>
            <li> strong air flow</li>
            <li> That it seems is true to its description on the box.ge travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying</li>
            <li> light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The Remington D is efficient, quick and a bit quieter than most.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> The Remington D-8410 hair dryer is the most powerful hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Included is a concentrator in the box and a coupon for a free diffuser.</li>
            <li> this one had such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> There was a coupon in the box with a code to get one free from their website</li>
            <li> I went to the website with my coupon from inside the box that says \\&quot;redeem your FREE diffuser at RemingtonProducts.com\\&quot;, put in the code</li>
            <li> You can send away for a free diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and the handle is comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A concentrator comes with the dryer and there is a coupon for a free diffuser in the box</li>
            <li> An airflow concentrator attachment is enclosed and a diffuser is available (at no charge) through the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Is my hair perfectly smooth?  </li>
            <li> If you purchase this dryer and receive a coupon that gives you a free diffuser you need to know that you may have to contact Remington in order to receive that product.</li>
            <li> received an apology, a diffuser, and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Either way it works fast, nice control settings.</li>
            <li> so far so good, its powerful, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, I was pleased,</li>
            <li> Good, solid hairdryer, but I do wish it was just a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is it&#x27;s very light weight, compared to my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> Ideally, a wet to straight flat iron would be the best solution, but the really good ones are beyond my bank balance, and the one I tried managed to burn my scalp in three places without straightening my hair, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is super powerful and dries it thoroughly in about 5-7 minutes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion: Not a bad dryer, but nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how soft my hair is after blow drying it.  </li>
            <li> The dryer has 3 heat and 2 speed settings, plus a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to set the hair.  </li>
            <li> It has two drying speeds and three heat levels plus a separate button which shoots cool air to help set your style in place.  </li>
            <li> That it seems is true to its description on the box.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer on a regular basis and find it to be as indicated -- a good, reliable dryer.</li>
            <li> but this dryer makes quick work of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the high setting- just checked to make sure it worked but</li>
            <li> I like this better than my old dryer, it is much lighter and has just as much or more power.</li>
            <li> Does it look almost 100% better than with a normal hair dryer?  </li>
            <li> As long as the compliments are blowing in the wind, she has her good hair</li>
            <li> Overall, a good dryer, but I have to admit I like my old one better.</li>
            <li> The price of this unit seems a bit high but being able to adjust the heat and blower settings is very handy and is kinder to my hair than my previous blow dryer.</li>
            <li> settings she likes very much(3 heat levels, 2 speeds) as the controls buttons are easy to move.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1875 Watts is powerful, and with multiple speed and heat settings you can get the perfect combination &amp; and quick dry</li>
            <li> I assume that Remington must have skimped on sound absorbing materials to reduce its weight, which doesn&#x27;t sit too well with me as I&#x27;d rather save my ears than my arms.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have owned some pretty nice dryers in the past but never any I liked as well as</li>
            <li> But it seems to be powerful.</li>
            <li> The setting that are possible by using different combinations of the switches make this a good choice for many types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Remington hairdryers and I find them to be good hairdryers that get the job done at a great price--often with the efficacy of more expensive hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> This is an underpowered hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t worth the time it took to unbox it.</li>
            <li> Far better options exist for this price point.</li>
            <li> seems to be too cool on my hair and the hot</li>
            <li> Firstly, it does a great job drying my hair, and it makes it soft and manageable,  and does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great-looking tool, very clean and professional.  </li>
            <li> Made a nice companion to the flat iron I also purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m irritated right now.  </li>
            <li> Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know the purpose of this since I have never had to clean the air filter of any of my hair dryers, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One feature that I really  like is the ability to take the air filter off and clean the dust out.</li>
            <li> dryer&#x27;s case is a beautiful pearlescent, light rose-tan color (not the gray shown in the product image above), and the switches are extremely easy-to-use toggles (rather than the hard-to-move sliders e.g. on the FastFinish).</li>
            <li> In her experience over many years, the electrical motor on blow dryers generally burn out within a couple of years.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is lightweight, easy to use and, importantly, the outside case doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The fast speed is so powerful, I couldn&#x27;t take the loud sound of the fan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for several weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference the first time I used it -</li>
            <li> The diffuser is not included in the box, but the company offers a free diffuser at their website.</li>
            <li> There was nothing in the box to more fully describe the benefits of the dryer &amp; ring, so all we have to go by are the basic claims on the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a couple of weeks and overall am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred for the second fan speed to be more of a medium flow rate,</li>
            <li> &#x27;shiny/smoothing gels\\&quot; but none of them work for more than the time it takes me to walk outside into heat and humidity!  </li>
            <li> thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li> noticed no difference in the strength or texture of my hair after using this, and I think the Keratin is more of a selling point than an actual feature that produces results.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t pretty or girly, but if you like products that work, you will like this one.  </li>

            <li> Doing what, exactly?</li>
            <li> is too hot.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer blows hot air and dries the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, quiet, and it get the  job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to dry your hair quickly with a 5 star dryer if you don&#x27;t mind the 2 downsides, which knock it down to 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> The settings are very easy to adjust especially when you have only one free hand</li>
            <li> Drying was very fast and my hair certainly did seem shinier.  </li>
            <li> The enclosed nozzle helps direct the air more directly to the spots of hair you are drying, which results in a smoother look without taking away from the body of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The back of the dryer flips open so you can clean the filter which is very convenient and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> It only last a year, which was surprising, so I looked around to order another.</li>
            <li> Because I am male and keep my hair fairly short, I am far, far from the ideal audience for this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This one is also very easy to use, without all the extra buttons as other dryers, making it easy to adjust to one&#x27;s needs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the D8410 is slightly larger, it does not feel any heavier and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine, chin length, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended is she has really long hair :)</li>
            <li> Easy to clean removable filter, after few months of use, it did collect a lot of dust and needed to be cleaned</li>
            <li> It dries her hair quicky so that she can get ready for work or recreation without much delay.</li>
            <li> There are 2 fan speeds- medium and powerfully fast.</li>
            <li> so you decide how much you would spend on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the concentrator only and has a coupon for a free diffuser.</li>
            <li> the lower and cold settings are great!</li>
            <li> really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a matter of principle.  </li>
            <li> It really depends if I can figure out why it&#x27;s sucking up my hair and if I get a \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; diffuser.</li>
            <li> She has now been using the D8410 for over a month and loves it as much as she does her Ac2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no way for you to really tell if the keratin ring is doing anything or is just a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the Remington D8410 Keratin dryer because of the lightweight aspect as well as the force of the air pushed through.</li>
            <li> There is really one suggestion I have to improve the dryer.</li>
            <li> But the case material is inexpensive plastic, the motor seems lightweight, and the unit is very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Keratin hair dryer really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> concentrator really weakens the air flow and dries the hair very slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s just marketing.</li>
            <li> hair is very course</li>
            <li> This Keratin Dryer is fast, efficient and that is a plus for someone like me who is always on the go.</li>
            <li> I knew going into this that a hair dryer was not going to get my hair perfectly straight, and it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that qualifies me to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But in the end, there really isn&#x27;t all that much to say.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is heavy, nice quality.</li>
            <li> I am also having trouble with the heat setting as warm</li>
            <li> The color as shown on here is not accurate, it is more of a golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many options in terms of cold, cool, warm and a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot button depending on your hair style and type which offers flexibility of use.  </li>
            <li> It has a powerful 1875 watts motor (most other hair driers range from 1000 - 1500 watts); motor runs quiet and blows plenty of air; the ceramic radiant heater is strong and produces enough heat for fast drying.</li>
            <li> Since her hair is very shiny, light &amp; grey</li>
            <li> It is a real time saver and a delight, not to have to allow an hour plus just to get my hair dry and looking civilized.  </li>
            <li> Her Remington, the first she has owned, unlike others including professional dryers, has stood the test of time and continues to work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new hair dryer makes blow drying a breeze!</li>
            <li> The keratin actually really seems to be a legitimate thing - I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair looks every time I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a tone of money on a hair dryer, but wanted a decent quality one.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job of drying your hair as slow or as fast as you choose.</li>
            <li> 3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> 3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I seem to be able to dry my hair twice as fast as I did with my older, big mouth dryer.</li>
            <li> Blow drying usually makes for a large volume of hair, and if you havea lot of volume to begin with, you don&#x27;t want more, trust me.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is the dryer is fairly loud however it does dry my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The Remington Keratin Dryer is a little larger than my other blow dryers, but this one is very light and you will love that about this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why that is important as one hair dryer seems like any other to me</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer and did quite a bit of research before purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> This dryer heats up quickly and dries my hair so much faster than other dryers.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with features similar to the Ac2015 - multiple heat and speed settings - and some that are unique to the D8410 including a 1875w high torque motor for faster drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did dry my hair quickly</li>
            <li> the nozzles of this model and the T-Studio are the same size and the attachments fit both; the nozzle of the FastFinish model is larger.)</li>
            <li> This dryer is very, very loud.</li>
            <li> But what she is satisfied with, are the unasked for compliments at bus stops, shops, &amp; other public places.</li>
            <li> top heavy design - the motor/fan section is huge (a common problem, in my opinion, with many dryers) with a long neck, if you use the attachment, it becomes so long and unbalanced with its weight, that you might hit your head with the dryer&#x27;s end</li>
            <li> Smooths and manages my hair and dries it really fast with lasting results.</li>
            <li> I like the different heat &amp; airflow settings so you can choose how much you want to control during your styling process.</li>
            <li> we got a turbo one when the old one died, the turbo one always made the circuit breaker switch/outlet jump, not this one;&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> so I could have it shipped directly to the person I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer about 10 times so far.  </li>
            <li> With this dryer, unlike my old one, I can adjust settings of blower strength and heat to suit all my needs.  </li>
            <li> Two of my three young daughters have curly hair</li>
            <li> Not too loud, even though it is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I really like the idea that it is easy to clean the filter, as I have had multiple dryers that end up smelling like burnt hair because they are difficult to keep clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for the price Amazon offers it at...</li>
            <li> I have a old one I have been using and this one made a ton of difference while drying my hair</li>
            <li> as it was on my old dryer, a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but this dryer has my hair smoothed out just enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to flat-iron it as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the standard professional shape (not collapsible), the standard 1875 watts, with airflow options of low and high, and heat options of cool, warm, and hot (plus a button for a burst of cold).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous hair dryer that was cheaper, so my hair isn&#x27;t as straight</li>
            <li> Figuring out how to use it for styling has been a bit of a challenge, as the high fan speed is extremely fast, while the low fan speed is much too slow to be useful.</li>
            <li> Great random gift for your girl!</li>
            <li> I was previously using a Remington hairdryer from a big-box supermarket retailer which was doing an adequate job in drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you used the loud fast fan speed with the hottest heat setting, you wouldn&#x27;t be holding this for very long, so the heavier weight wouldn&#x27;t be a problem on your wrists.</li>
            <li> If you need power and like to dry your hair fast, and if you don&#x27;t mind a heavier dryer that is loud, this dryer is for you.</li>
            <li> The advertised \\&quot;FREE DIFFUSER availabe with included coupon\\&quot; IS NOT FREE!  </li>
            <li> so it usually takes a lot of time to smooth it out</li>
            <li> It is a very serviceable hair dryer, of average weight and with decent blowing power.  </li>
            <li> According to my three girls this hair dryer is really really loud compared to my old one as they cheer when \\&quot;you are finally done drying your hair!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My hair was very soft AND manageable, at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I like using the concentrator in general, but if I had not taken it off out of curiosity, I would have given this a three stars, or fewer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hearing problem, but this is simply too loud, as in-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything to my hair because I didn&#x27;t feel any changes, but that didn&#x27;t matter because my hair dried quicker and straighted out nicely.</li>
            <li> I must say that I have used dozens of hair dryers over the years and the main differences are size, how they feel in your hand, how hot they get and how hard they blow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy on my wrists and too loud on the fast fan speed.</li>
            <li> Each time my hair was soft and dry without the frizzy halo that a blow dryer generally produces.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever had a hair dryer this powerful (1875 W)</li>
            <li> The keratin-infused nozzle ring looks like an ordinary plastic ring at the end of the nozzle and I&#x27;m not convinced that it makes a huge difference in the end result, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do anything negative.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that the keratin therapy is doing anything for my hair as I have yet to notice a significant difference between this hair dry and my last hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is fairly large as it will not fit into my cabinet drawer.  </li>
            <li> This is as powerful as all the other Remington dryers I&#x27;ve tried, meaning one can get her hair dried in ample time.  </li>
            <li> At high speed it only got a little warmer.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with this product is that the controls are right where your fingers go while holding the hairdryer to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair in less time than my older dryer</li>
            <li> My question is: How long will this hairdryer last?  </li>
            <li> This one has ripped my hair a couple of times and it makes it look rather flat</li>
            <li> The instructions said that after I finished drying my hair, I would need to go over it with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Five minutes with a flat iron produced the desired straightness afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have found no drawbacks, with the possible exception that sometimes it is a bit difficult to remove attachments from the nozzle because they fit so snugly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was less noisy than my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy, coarse, wavy/curly, dry hair for all of my life.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and has a diffuser which I use every time I dry my hair which keeps it from going in 1,000 different directions as the heat hits it.</li>
            <li> nozzle accessory is easy to put on, but a bit difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my previous dryer, I like that this one is noticeably lighter in weight... about 17 ounces compared to 21 ounces, which may not sound like much but makes a big difference when holding it up over my head for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, colored hair and the dryer dried it very quickly but seemed to make my hair overall a little frizzier than my old dryer and the ends specifically a lot drier.  </li>
            <li> so since my hair is very thick that is only surface layer in the very front dry-ish!</li>
            <li> Also found that once dry my hair was very flat feeling - no matter what styling products I used.</li>
            <li> I was not wild about this unit when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li> and it is not clear how long the keratin itself is working.  </li>
            <li> Whether there is any other significant advantage over the typical \\&quot;brand X\\&quot; dryer is hard to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this dryer it took me twice as long to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the cord seems a little short to me.</li>
            <li> It takes 2-3 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster&lt;</li>
            <li> also didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster with the concentrator, but the air is a lot stronger without it, so the hair dryer faster part may have some truth to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hairdryer did not dry my hair any faster than my previous one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is any stronger or shinier, although the top of my head seems a bit flatter than usual - the bottom half of my hair (which is long, past shoulder length an inch or two) is still dry and frizzy and uneven.</li>
            <li> In the past I had to leave my hair wrapped in a towel for nearly an hour before I attempted to dry it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s missing the rubber nubs on the side that keep it from falling off the counter when I set it down if it&#x27;s running (to take out a clip to start a new section of hair)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not worth paying extra for, but the price for the dryer is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have black Asian hair, never</li>
            <li> I have only had one hair dryer in my life that straightened my unruly looks without making the end result look like a bush that had just been frightened half to death.  </li>
            <li> A little bit heavy and loud from what I expect!</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is a little larger than I&#x27;m used to but</li>
            <li> The cord is just a little too short for my needs and the instructions tell you not to use an extension cord with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually amazed at how little airflow and heat it generates.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling softer than other products and my hair feels healthier than when i let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> three temperature setting buttons are fine - cold, warm, hot, but I am not sure why there is a cold temperature setting when there is also a cold jet button; I&#x27;m guessing so that you don&#x27;t have to keep pressing the button.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanable air filter on the back -</li>
            <li> Came on time packaged as expected.</li>
            <li> I suppose you&#x27;d have to use this for a few months to see any difference in your hair, as I didn&#x27;t notice anything in only a couple</li>
            <li> heavy enough that I had to change hands holding it</li>
            <li> (I already have straight, thin hair)</li>
            <li> thus, as you are drying your hair, you are also allegedly blowing keratin into your hair, making it healthier, fuller, etc. etc.  </li>
            <li> while I am skeptical about that, I will say that my hair, in a very dry climate with little humidity, seems less brittle and dried out and has a lot more bounce and shine.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and blow drying is not good for it.  </li>
            <li> I passed over other hair dryers because they didn&#x27;t have diffusers.  </li>
            <li> other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if I am actually receiving any benefit from the Keratin infused ring.</li>
            <li> If your not super careful you will repeatedly change the settings.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s close to dry, I put it on the lowest speed and attach the end piece taking it one section at a time to straighten, using a round brush or a brush than minimizes tangles.  </li>
            <li> That is my one big complaint.</li>
            <li> am skeptical about the whole keratin treatment part of this product.</li>
            <li> will add that I did not have sopping wet hair but had towel and air dried my hair for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, if you need a new or a second hair dryer, Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer probably won&#x27;t be a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s down on the wall beside the sink then you have to juggle a bit to use it.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer cuts that down to one or two.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisier than my other one, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I mean do they need to know personal things like your income just because you bought one of their hair dryers?</li>
            <li> Her biggest complaint is that it is a little big.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would help my hair become shinier and hopefully less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but, like some of the previous reviewers, I don&#x27;t use one.  </li>
            <li> My previous hairdryer was under $20</li>
            <li> but I did not notice any less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> considered this noisy, but I found it less so than her</li>
            <li> and [[ASIN:B0050QLDGY FastFinish]] blow dryers; they both surpass the inexpensive dryers I&#x27;d previously used all my life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comparable to all those previous</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have a wife and daughter, each with long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day, I have very thick hair and every other hair dryer</li>
            <li> I could see someone with very thick hair finding this not to be enough.</li>
            <li> Hot or cold air pushing past the ring release keratin molecules that are pushed on to and into your hair.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this hair drier for a few months now.</li>
            <li> weight of this dryer is on the heavy side-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the hair dryer a few times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the heavy side</li>
            <li> thoroughly dried and still curly without frizz.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is too heavy (to put thing into perspective for you).</li>
            <li> My wife found it just a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Just a bit heavy for her taste.</li>
            <li> I was used to a small, less \\&quot;pistol\\&quot; type of dryer with one heat setting and one speed...</li>
            <li> I had way less frizzes and flyaways than I usually do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying, but not a huge deal as drying time is quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am not sure how well it works for my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the keratin ring...</li>
            <li> However, for now, it is like any ordinary hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the keratin therapy part -- or how it works.</li>
            <li> so I basically need no more than 60 seconds with this dryer to be finished.  </li>
            <li> Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this one.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t necessarily believe everything I read or hear, but I grudgingly decided to give this little dryer a whirl.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li> The idea that a plastic ring is somehow transferring protein to your hair is so ridiculous it defies logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is extremely subtle...</li>
            <li> She is weak in her arms however.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> The dryer sputtered a bit for approximately one month and then refused to turn on.</li>
            <li> and I hate drying because it takes so long</li>
            <li> thing I do not like, is the hook at the bottom, it has a weird shape and it makes the hair dryer fall sometimes.</li>
            <li> but as all things- it is not perfect.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Remington.</li>
            <li> It also has a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; to set your style.</li>
            <li> One button is sort of in a bad spot b/c  I keep pushing it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the newer model, the keratin therapy and am slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> in the name is also fairly stupid.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if ones hair is in terrible shape to start with?</li>

            <li> I love this hairdryer. Dries the hair very quick. Just wish it got a smidgen hotter for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works wonders! Smooths and manages my hair and dries it really fast with lasting results. I like the different heat &amp; airflow settings so you can choose how much you want to control during your styling process. The keratin actually really seems to be a legitimate thing - I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair looks every time I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavy, nice quality. I feel like it&#x27;s going to last. The ionic aspect is great, it adds so much body to my hair &amp; my hair is also shinier and softer. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Don&#x27;t know if the keratin is helping</li>
            <li> Like it. Light weight. One button is sort of in a bad spot b/c  I keep pushing it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
            <li> The Remington D is efficient, quick and a bit quieter than most.  I have found no drawbacks, with the possible exception that sometimes it is a bit difficult to remove attachments from the nozzle because they fit so snugly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. It takes 2-3 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling softer than other products and my hair feels healthier than when i let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is lightweight, easy to use and, importantly, the outside case doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not sure how well it works for my wife&#x27;s hair. It dries her hair quicky so that she can get ready for work or recreation without much delay. Whether there is any other significant advantage over the typical \\&quot;brand X\\&quot; dryer is hard to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you need a new or a second hair dryer, Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer probably won&#x27;t be a disappointment.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this hair drier for a few months now. It has three heat sittings and two fan speeds, which will satisfy most people. It has a powerful 1875 watts motor (most other hair driers range from 1000 - 1500 watts); motor runs quiet and blows plenty of air; the ceramic radiant heater is strong and produces enough heat for fast drying. Easy to clean removable filter, after few months of use, it did collect a lot of dust and needed to be cleaned (air flow difference noticed before and after cleaning). The drier is well balanced and easy to handle considering motor size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;As for \\&quot;The Remington Keratin Therapy\\&quot; and its claim of a \\&quot;shiny, healthy finish\\&quot;; no one really noticed any difference in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good hair drier, seems durable and we expect it to last for years to come.</li>
            <li> we got a turbo one when the old one died, the turbo one always made the circuit breaker switch/outlet jump, not this one;&lt;br /&gt;one thing I do not like, is the hook at the bottom, it has a weird shape and it makes the hair dryer fall sometimes.</li>
            <li> To big a bulky &amp; not a lot of power.</li>
            <li> I looked at this in the store and wanted one. Was glad I found it here so I could have it shipped directly to the person I wanted it for. Came on time packaged as expected. Made a nice companion to the flat iron I also purchased.</li>
            <li> the betsssssssss the betssssss</li>
            <li> great for the price...doesn&#x27;t get too hot, which is great for not burning my hair :) i would buy again...</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer and did quite a bit of research before purchasing this one.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a tone of money on a hair dryer, but wanted a decent quality one. It is a little noisier than my other one, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  I like the different speed options and the different temperature options.</li>
            <li> My fianc√© was really happy with this hair dryer! Great random gift for your girl! Highly recommended is she has really long hair :)</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Works great, no bad burning smell.</li>
            <li> very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  It is the best one I have ever owned.  The only thing I dislike is that the buttons are on the handle where you grasp it so I am always changing the speed or the temperature without meaning too.</li>
            <li> The Remington D-8410 hair dryer is the most powerful hair dryer I have ever used. It does an amazing job of drying your hair as slow or as fast as you choose. There are 2 fan speeds- medium and powerfully fast. The fast speed is so powerful, I couldn&#x27;t take the loud sound of the fan. I don&#x27;t have a hearing problem, but this is simply too loud, as in- I could use earplugs like when I use the electric hedger loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 heat speeds which are great- cool, lukewarm and hot, and in addition, there is a cool air shot. There is a ring of Keratin at the nozzle, which is supposed to keep your hair strong, shiny and healthy. I suppose you&#x27;d have to use this for a few months to see any difference in your hair, as I didn&#x27;t notice anything in only a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of this dryer is on the heavy side- heavy enough that I had to change hands holding it every couple minutes. I suppose if you used the loud fast fan speed with the hottest heat setting, you wouldn&#x27;t be holding this for very long, so the heavier weight wouldn&#x27;t be a problem on your wrists. Included is a concentrator in the box and a coupon for a free diffuser. There is a hanging loop and a removable air filter for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful, great hair dryer- but as all things- it is not perfect. It&#x27;s heavy on my wrists and too loud on the fast fan speed. If you need power and like to dry your hair fast, and if you don&#x27;t mind a heavier dryer that is loud, this dryer is for you. It is nice to be able to dry your hair quickly with a 5 star dryer if you don&#x27;t mind the 2 downsides, which knock it down to 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the keratin ring...how is keratin transferred to your hair? It&#x27;s a protein. Your hair is made of keratin. Putting keratin next to keratin isn&#x27;t going to make it bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for several weeks now and love it.  It is lightweight and powerful.  The enclosed nozzle helps direct the air more directly to the spots of hair you are drying, which results in a smoother look without taking away from the body of the hair.  The dryer has 3 heat and 2 speed settings, plus a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to set the hair.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever had a hair dryer this powerful (1875 W) that was so lightweight.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this hairdryer being very excited that it contained keratin. I hoped it would help my hair become shinier and hopefully less frizzy. I have coarse wavy midlength hair. I was previously using a Remington hairdryer from a big-box supermarket retailer which was doing an adequate job in drying my hair. I have used this dryer about 10 times so far.  Here are my thoughts:  1. It is a pretty hairdryer. It&#x27;s not silver like the picture shows. It is a champagne color and has a sleeker profile than my regular hairdryer. The rocker-style buttons are easy to push. It did not come with a diffuser but, like some of the previous reviewers, I don&#x27;t use one.  2. This hairdryer did not dry my hair any faster than my previous one.  3. I have not seen any difference in my hair...no texture difference, not any shinier, NOTHING. My previous hairdryer was under $20 so you decide how much you would spend on a hairdryer.  4. &amp;#34;The exclusive keratin therapy lasts for the entire life of the hair dryer.&amp;#34;  This is on the box and on the Amazon site. My question is: How long will this hairdryer last?  I will continue to use this hairdryer and maybe I will see a difference in the future. However, for now, it is like any ordinary hairdryer.  EDITED on 3/27/15  The dryer sputtered a bit for approximately one month and then refused to turn on. It lasted 1 year and 8 months.</li>
            <li> I was not wild about this unit when I opened the box.  I was used to a small, less \\&quot;pistol\\&quot; type of dryer with one heat setting and one speed...on.  Boy, have I changed my mind.  I love the variety of settings on this dryer.  I have thin, fine hair and blow drying is not good for it.  With this dryer, unlike my old one, I can adjust settings of blower strength and heat to suit all my needs.  The design fits well in my hand, is well balanced but I am still getting used to the length of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;The advertisements talk of the benefits of a Keratin ring and while I am skeptical about that, I will say that my hair, in a very dry climate with little humidity, seems less brittle and dried out and has a lot more bounce and shine.  The price of this unit seems a bit high but being able to adjust the heat and blower settings is very handy and is kinder to my hair than my previous blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is supposed to be keratin infusion. I have no idea why that is important as one hair dryer seems like any other to me but thought I would mention it for the more savvy buyers. It&#x27;s nice and lightweight. The only drawback is the cord seems a little short to me. If you have a plug in over the sink, you should be okay but if it&#x27;s down on the wall beside the sink then you have to juggle a bit to use it. Since you aren&#x27;t supposed to put these on an extension cord, you&#x27;d think they could make the cords longer. This is probably the same length as all of them are though so that isn&#x27;t a drawback. It has 3 settings and 2 speeds and has a switch on the end of cord where you plug it in as well. It looks fancy too. It comes with the concentrator only and has a coupon for a free diffuser. That is my one big complaint. They should have put the diffuser in with it because it&#x27;s obvious when you go register the product what they are up too. I mean do they need to know personal things like your income just because you bought one of their hair dryers? I decided not to register because I didn&#x27;t feel like that was any of their business and that I would be getting spam mail from everyone on earth since they also wanted my email address. So no diffuser for me, I guess. I&#x27;m pleased with their product but not with their nosiness.</li>
            <li> I have owned some pretty nice dryers in the past but never any I liked as well as this one had such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;First the most important added option - the keratin ring on the end - It works just the way it says it does! Hot or cold air pushing past the ring release keratin molecules that are pushed on to and into your hair. I could see the difference the first time I used it - I had way less frizzes and flyaways than I usually do and the effect seemed to last all day and well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t bake my hair I haven&#x27;t used the high setting- just checked to make sure it worked but the lower and cold settings are great! I seem to be able to dry my hair twice as fast as I did with my older, big mouth dryer. The buttons are easy to change without looking once you get used to knowing where they are.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I pack a smaller dryer when I travel but as big as this puppy is - it&#x27;s coming with me so I have great vacation hair too. I&#x27;ll just have to leave the 5th pair of shoes at home!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Remington dryer.  My favorite thing about it is it&#x27;s very light weight, compared to my old dryer.  In the description it indicates a diffuser but it does not come with one.  There was a coupon in the box with a code to get one free from their website but the coupon code did not work. I had to email customer service and sent one really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did dry my hair quickly but I did not notice any less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was less noisy than my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how soft my hair is after blow drying it.  I blow dry my hair every day, I have very thick hair and every other hair dryer has left my hair so brittle, I&#x27;d have to give it a deep conditioning once a week.  After purchasing this I give my hair a deep conditioning treatment maybe every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the hair dryer a few times so I can&#x27;t say if the keratin ring helps or not.  Here are my issues...&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s on the heavy side&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s missing the rubber nubs on the side that keep it from falling off the counter when I set it down if it&#x27;s running (to take out a clip to start a new section of hair)&lt;br /&gt;- It has sucked my hair into the air intake a couple of times (OUCH!)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous hair dryer that was cheaper, so my hair isn&#x27;t as straight and I have to hit it with a straightener after drying.&lt;br /&gt;- The advertised \\&quot;FREE DIFFUSER availabe with included coupon\\&quot; IS NOT FREE!  Two of my three young daughters have curly hair so I NEED a diffuser (I&#x27;m not going to straighten their hair).  I passed over other hair dryers because they didn&#x27;t have diffusers.  The reviews for this hair dryer are good, so I thought, it&#x27;s worth the wait for a diffuser.  I went to the website with my coupon from inside the box that says \\&quot;redeem your FREE diffuser at RemingtonProducts.com\\&quot;, put in the code and it only reduced the price of the diffuser.  Ummm...that&#x27;s not \\&quot;FREE\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m irritated right now.  It&#x27;s really just a matter of principle.  I contacted the company so hopefully it&#x27;s just a mistake of some sort.  I can&#x27;t believe I have to go through all of this for a diffuser!  Next time I&#x27;ll buy a hair dryer with the diffuser in the box!  I might still return it, we&#x27;ll see.  It really depends if I can figure out why it&#x27;s sucking up my hair and if I get a \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; diffuser.</li>
            <li> Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch. First time I used it, I was pleased,</li>
            <li> Good, solid hairdryer, but I do wish it was just a bit more powerful. I could see someone with very thick hair finding this not to be enough.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and myself have waist length hair. This dryer is super powerful and dries it thoroughly in about 5-7 minutes! The only complaint I have with this product is that the controls are right where your fingers go while holding the hairdryer to dry your hair. If your not super careful you will repeatedly change the settings. It&#x27;s a little annoying, but not a huge deal as drying time is quick. I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars, regardless.</li>
            <li> This new hair dryer makes blow drying a breeze! A Keratin infused nozzle ring protects the hair during styling.  Drying was very fast and my hair certainly did seem shinier.  The box says to use the Keratin Therapy dryer to penetrate, restore &amp; repair your hair.  It has three heat settings 2 speed settings. It also has a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; to set your style. You can send away for a free diffuser.  Great light-weight, nicely designed dryer. Has a hang-up loop on the end. Looks good even when not being used.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is simply a great handheld dryer. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1875 Watts is powerful, and with multiple speed and heat settings you can get the perfect combination &amp; and quick dry time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s light weight and the handle is comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not too loud, even though it is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Large, easy to add diffuser leaves my wavy/curly hair thoroughly dried and still curly without frizz. Being able to adjust both the temp and the airflow allows the diffuser to work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I really like the idea that it is easy to clean the filter, as I have had multiple dryers that end up smelling like burnt hair because they are difficult to keep clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And,  couple of things that could have been better, but still allow this to be a great purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The diffuser is not included in the box, but the company offers a free diffuser at their website. I went to the company&#x27;s website and applied the promotion code, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I simply sent an e-mail to their Customer Service and immediately got a response that they would be sending me the diffuser at no charge. It arrived promptly within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The hype about this dryer is the featured \\&quot;Keratin Therapy\\&quot;, which I&#x27;m unsure about. The keratin-infused nozzle ring looks like an ordinary plastic ring at the end of the nozzle and I&#x27;m not convinced that it makes a huge difference in the end result, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do anything negative. There was nothing in the box to more fully describe the benefits of the dryer &amp; ring, so all we have to go by are the basic claims on the box. It&#x27;s probably not worth paying extra for, but the price for the dryer is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she seems to be happy with it. Her biggest complaint is that it is a little big. But it seems to be powerful. Not sure about the keratin therapy part -- or how it works. But it seems good.</li>
            <li> Although I strongly doubt that the keratin ring will make any difference in my hair, I love this hair dryer for its beautiful ergonomic design. It is not quiet, I dont think so. But, and it is a big BUT: It is very light. I am a person that could not use the Ipad b/c it is too heavy (to put thing into perspective for you). I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Buen Producto Me Gusto Este Secador Buena Marca Y Perfecto Estado Aunque Segun Venia Una Tapa De Regalo Y No Venia Igual Lo Recomiendo</li>
            <li> This is a great blow drier for the money.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT- EXCELLENT VALUE!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, chin length, blonde hair. I want a blow dryer that has heat at low speed. This dryer does not get very hot - barely warm. At high speed it only got a little warmer. With this dryer it took me twice as long to dry and style my hair. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with longer or thicker hair using this dryer. Also found that once dry my hair was very flat feeling - no matter what styling products I used. Don&#x27;t know if that was because of the keratin-ring feature. Did not work for me and I returned it after working with it for a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my share of dryers, and this is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  It&#x27;s light weight, quiet, and it get the  job done quickly.  I love Remington as a brand, and this dryer exceeded my expectations.  And for the price Amazon offers it at...it&#x27;s a must- buy!  Love this dryer!</li>
            <li> Awesome and lightweight blow dryer. I have a old one I have been using and this one made a ton of difference while drying my hair</li>
            <li> I like this better than my old dryer, it is much lighter and has just as much or more power. Very nice.</li>
            <li> In reading some reviews I found that many considered this hair dryer light weight. My wife found it just a bit heavy. She is weak in her arms however.&lt;br /&gt;Some considered this noisy, but I found it less so than her other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;The settings she likes very much(3 heat levels, 2 speeds) as the controls buttons are easy to move.&lt;br /&gt;She also likes the color &amp; stylish look of it.&lt;br /&gt;In the end it all comes done to the hair. Since her hair is very shiny, light &amp; grey she&#x27;s is never satified with \\&quot;the look\\&quot; in her mirror. But what she is satisfied with, are the unasked for compliments at bus stops, shops, &amp; other public places. As long as the compliments are blowing in the wind, she has her good hair days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 out of 5 stars. Just a bit heavy for her taste.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using a Remington Ac2015 (which I reviewed) since the fall of 2010 for blow drying her hair. In her experience over many years, the electrical motor on blow dryers generally burn out within a couple of years. Her Remington, the first she has owned, unlike others including professional dryers, has stood the test of time and continues to work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer to test, my wife (my tester) initially resisted using it. She was perfectly happy with the Ac2015 and did not want to change. She has now been using the D8410 for over a month and loves it as much as she does her Ac2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the D8410 is slightly larger, it does not feel any heavier and is easy to hold. The unit comes with features similar to the Ac2015 - multiple heat and speed settings - and some that are unique to the D8410 including a 1875w high torque motor for faster drying. The exclusive Keratin-infused nozzle ring may offer value but my wife has not yet noticed any difference in a \\&quot;better shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Remington is a great brand and both the Ac2015 and now the D8410 deliver reliability, durability, and good results. You cannot go wrong with Remington.</li>
            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is a little larger than I&#x27;m used to but light weight and easy to handle.  It has two drying speeds and three heat levels plus a separate button which shoots cool air to help set your style in place.  I have long, thin, colored hair and the dryer dried it very quickly but seemed to make my hair overall a little frizzier than my old dryer and the ends specifically a lot drier.  There is no way for you to really tell if the keratin ring is doing anything or is just a gimmick.  The cord is just a little too short for my needs and the instructions tell you not to use an extension cord with the dryer.  The back of the dryer flips open so you can clean the filter which is very convenient and a nice feature.  A concentrator comes with the dryer and there is a coupon for a free diffuser in the box but when I went online to order it I was told my coupon code was no longer valid.  I tried three separate times just to be sure I hadn&#x27;t done something wrong but got the same result each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a couple of weeks and overall am pleased with it. It is very fast and very hot, so it does a wonderful job of drying hair quickly. Figuring out how to use it for styling has been a bit of a challenge, as the high fan speed is extremely fast, while the low fan speed is much too slow to be useful. I would have preferred for the second fan speed to be more of a medium flow rate, as it was on my old dryer, a [[ASIN:B003V264WW Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer]], but I&#x27;m gradually learning how to keep my hair from flying away when the dryer is on high, and honestly, my hair turns out looking wonderful regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my previous dryer, I like that this one is noticeably lighter in weight... about 17 ounces compared to 21 ounces, which may not sound like much but makes a big difference when holding it up over my head for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. The tradeoff? This dryer is very, very loud. I assume that Remington must have skimped on sound absorbing materials to reduce its weight, which doesn&#x27;t sit too well with me as I&#x27;d rather save my ears than my arms. Overall, a good dryer, but I have to admit I like my old one better.</li>
            <li> I really do like the Remington D8410 Keratin dryer because of the lightweight aspect as well as the force of the air pushed through. I have thick hair and I hate drying because it takes so long but this dryer makes quick work of it. There is really one suggestion I have to improve the dryer. The buttons on the handle are easy to change but too easy. I wrap my hand around the handle and my thumb bumps the settings constantly. It would be easier if the settings were on a slide rather than the protruding buttons.</li>
            <li> I love Remington&#x27;s [[ASIN:B003V264WW T-Studio]] and [[ASIN:B0050QLDGY FastFinish]] blow dryers; they both surpass the inexpensive dryers I&#x27;d previously used all my life. This model, though, is just okay ... it&#x27;s comparable to all those previous dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the standard professional shape (not collapsible), the standard 1875 watts, with airflow options of low and high, and heat options of cool, warm, and hot (plus a button for a burst of cold). An airflow concentrator attachment is enclosed and a diffuser is available (at no charge) through the company&#x27;s website. (FYI: the nozzles of this model and the T-Studio are the same size and the attachments fit both; the nozzle of the FastFinish model is larger.) The box touts \\&quot;Keratin Therapy\\&quot; (a keratin-infused ring around the dryer nozzle) as giving \\&quot;healthier, stronger hair,\\&quot; but I doubt the claim and have noticed no such effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer&#x27;s case is a beautiful pearlescent, light rose-tan color (not the gray shown in the product image above), and the switches are extremely easy-to-use toggles (rather than the hard-to-move sliders e.g. on the FastFinish). The airflow is strong and there&#x27;s plenty of heat. But the case material is inexpensive plastic, the motor seems lightweight, and the unit is very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;For adults, try the [[ASIN:B003V264WW T-Studio dryer]] -- it&#x27;s visually beautiful, with strong airflow and plenty of heat while being the quietest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use on children, try the [[ASIN:B0050QLDGY FastFinish]] -- a fuller, blowsy airflow with very-warm (rather than hot-hot) temperature.</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy, coarse, wavy/curly, dry hair for all of my life.  I have tried many conditioners and leave-in mousses and &#x27;shiny/smoothing gels\\&quot; but none of them work for more than the time it takes me to walk outside into heat and humidity!  This Keratin hair dryer really does the trick.  Is my hair perfectly smooth?  No but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be.  Does it look almost 100% better than with a normal hair dryer?  Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I did not have sopping wet hair but had towel and air dried my hair for about 30 minutes so since my hair is very thick that is only surface layer in the very front dry-ish!</li>
            <li> I like using the concentrator in general, but if I had not taken it off out of curiosity, I would have given this a three stars, or fewer. I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very strong air flow&lt;br /&gt;The three temperature setting buttons are fine - cold, warm, hot, but I am not sure why there is a cold temperature setting when there is also a cold jet button; I&#x27;m guessing so that you don&#x27;t have to keep pressing the button.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanable air filter on the back - I don&#x27;t really know the purpose of this since I have never had to clean the air filter of any of my hair dryers, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very top heavy design - the motor/fan section is huge (a common problem, in my opinion, with many dryers) with a long neck, if you use the attachment, it becomes so long and unbalanced with its weight, that you might hit your head with the dryer&#x27;s end (I did a couple of times, and I am 5&#x27;5\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;The concentrator really weakens the air flow and dries the hair very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Without the concentrator, hair tangles easily.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the placement of the buttons; they interfere with me holding the dryer and maneuvering the tool. Basically, they get in my way and I keep pushing the buttons accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical about the whole keratin treatment part of this product. I really think it&#x27;s just marketing. I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is any stronger or shinier, although the top of my head seems a bit flatter than usual - the bottom half of my hair (which is long, past shoulder length an inch or two) is still dry and frizzy and uneven. May just be my hair, I don&#x27;t know. The dryer did not work wonders on me. I have black Asian hair, never dyed.&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster with the concentrator, but the air is a lot stronger without it, so the hair dryer faster part may have some truth to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: Not a bad dryer, but nothing special about it. I&#x27;d recommend The Sharper Image travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image. That it seems is true to its description on the box.ge travel ionic dryer over this for the lighter weight, more balanced feel, and faster drying action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 3-12-13:&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve noticed one thing I do like about this dryer - it does not burn my hair as much as my Sharper Image.

            <li> The Remington D8410 Keratin Dryer works great, but as far as the keratin therapy I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything to my hair because I didn&#x27;t feel any changes, but that didn&#x27;t matter because my hair dried quicker and straighted out nicely. This dryer heats up quickly and dries my hair so much faster than other dryers. The Remington Keratin Dryer is a little larger than my other blow dryers, but this one is very light and you will love that about this dryer. The settings are very easy to adjust especially when you have only one free hand and this makes it perfect for me when I use my brush to help straighten out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very course so it usually takes a lot of time to smooth it out but this dryer has my hair smoothed out just enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to flat-iron it as much. This Keratin Dryer is fast, efficient and that is a plus for someone like me who is always on the go. I love this dryer and I&#x27;m sure you will too.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer on a regular basis and find it to be as indicated -- a good, reliable dryer. It is lightweight and has a diffuser which I use every time I dry my hair which keeps it from going in 1,000 different directions as the heat hits it. It seems to dry my hair in less time than my older dryer but I am not sure if I am actually receiving any benefit from the Keratin infused ring. If you purchase this dryer and receive a coupon that gives you a free diffuser you need to know that you may have to contact Remington in order to receive that product. For most of us, the code given on the coupon did not work when we went on-line to redeem it. However, in my case an e-mail to Remington customer service yielded great results --I received an apology, a diffuser, and free shipping. This to me was an example of excellent customer service --- thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer, The color as shown on here is not accurate, it is more of a golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle accessory is easy to put on, but a bit difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drys well, and feels nice against your hair and scalp. The setting that are possible by using different combinations of the switches make this a good choice for many types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no difference in the strength or texture of my hair after using this, and I think the Keratin is more of a selling point than an actual feature that produces results.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington Pearl blow dryer that I loved. It only last a year, which was surprising, so I looked around to order another. I decided to try the newer model, the keratin therapy and am slightly disappointed. This one has ripped my hair a couple of times and it makes it look rather flat (I already have straight, thin hair) so maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to try the keratin. Either way it works fast, nice control settings. Just prefer the pearl version over this one.</li>
            <li> I knew going into this that a hair dryer was not going to get my hair perfectly straight, and it didn&#x27;t.  The instructions said that after I finished drying my hair, I would need to go over it with a flat iron.  I have only had one hair dryer in my life that straightened my unruly looks without making the end result look like a bush that had just been frightened half to death.  Sadly that one died on me shortly after I fell in love with it, so my quest began again.  Ideally, a wet to straight flat iron would be the best solution, but the really good ones are beyond my bank balance, and the one I tried managed to burn my scalp in three places without straightening my hair, so I tried this.  I expect a lot and I don&#x27;t necessarily believe everything I read or hear, but I grudgingly decided to give this little dryer a whirl.  Firstly, it does a great job drying my hair, and it makes it soft and manageable,  and does not dry it out.  My hair was very soft AND manageable, at the same time.  Thank you keratin ring!  Blow drying usually makes for a large volume of hair, and if you havea lot of volume to begin with, you don&#x27;t want more, trust me.  I have used this dryer about a dozen times with good results.  Each time my hair was soft and dry without the frizzy halo that a blow dryer generally produces.  Five minutes with a flat iron produced the desired straightness afterwards.  This is a good product and if I can&#x27;t get what I want, I will settle very happily for this.  One thing I did discover was that the wetter my hair was when I started drying it, the better the results were.  In the past I had to leave my hair wrapped in a towel for nearly an hour before I attempted to dry it.  It is a real time saver and a delight, not to have to allow an hour plus just to get my hair dry and looking civilized.  All in all, this is as close to perfect as I can get, and I will happily take it.  I really liked that the manufacturer didn&#x27;t promise anything that it couldn&#x27;t deliver.  What they did promise, they delivered, so five stars and a smiley face from me.  This isn&#x27;t pretty or girly, but if you like products that work, you will like this one.  It&#x27;s a keeper.t they did promise, they delivered, so five stars and a smiley face from me.  This isn&#x27;t pretty or girly, but if you like products that work, you will like this one.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product.  It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 10-12 minutes. When it&#x27;s close to dry, I put it on the lowest speed and attach the end piece taking it one section at a time to straighten, using a round brush or a brush than minimizes tangles.  It takes about 3 passes per section to straighten my hair.  It also seems to enhance the shine as it straightens it. I&#x27;ve had it over six months and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> so far so good, its powerful, and easy to handle.  very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used the Remington Keratin therapy dryer for one month.  I am not convinced about their spin on Keratin Therapy Keratin Ring.  How does one know if this enhances one&#x27;s hair  and it is not clear how long the keratin itself is working.  The hair dryer itself is easy to hold although it would not be easy to take traveling. It is too bulky to pack.  There are many options in terms of cold, cool, warm and a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot button depending on your hair style and type which offers flexibility of use.  One feature that I really  like is the ability to take the air filter off and clean the dust out. If you want a hair dryer at home this is very adequate but if you want a hair dryer to use at home and take traveling, this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I must say that I have used dozens of hair dryers over the years and the main differences are size, how they feel in your hand, how hot they get and how hard they blow.  This dryer meets all the criteria fairly well and appears to be just the right weight for me.  I like the silver color as most of the dryers I have gotten seem to always be blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have alot of hair so I basically need no more than 60 seconds with this dryer to be finished.  Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this one.</li>
            <li> A little bit heavy and loud from what I expect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Remington hairdryers and I find them to be good hairdryers that get the job done at a great price--often with the efficacy of more expensive hairdryers.  However, this is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  The keratin infusion is a marvelous attribute that leaves each dry job looking better and better.  This is as powerful as all the other Remington dryers I&#x27;ve tried, meaning one can get her hair dried in ample time.  This one is also very easy to use, without all the extra buttons as other dryers, making it easy to adjust to one&#x27;s needs.  It&#x27;s also a great-looking tool, very clean and professional.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this.</li>
            <li> This is an underpowered hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t worth the time it took to unbox it. I&#x27;m actually amazed at how little airflow and heat it generates. Far better options exist for this price point. 1875 watts? Doing what, exactly? Oh and the word \\&quot;Keratin\\&quot; in the name is also fairly stupid. The idea that a plastic ring is somehow transferring protein to your hair is so ridiculous it defies logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have used the Remington Keratin therapy dryer for several months now. I am not sure that the keratin therapy is doing anything for my hair as I have yet to notice a significant difference between this hair dry and my last hair dryer.  I am also having trouble with the heat setting as warm seems to be too cool on my hair and the hot is too hot.  According to my three girls this hair dryer is really really loud compared to my old one as they cheer when \\&quot;you are finally done drying your hair!!\\&quot;  The dryer is fairly large as it will not fit into my cabinet drawer.  The bottom line is the dryer is fairly loud however it does dry my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Because I am male and keep my hair fairly short, I am far, far from the ideal audience for this hair dryer.  My hair dries on its own in about five minutes. The hair dryer cuts that down to one or two. I really don&#x27;t think that qualifies me to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have a wife and daughter, each with long, thick hair.  Ideal test subjects!  But in the end, there really isn&#x27;t all that much to say.  The hair dryer blows hot air and dries the hair.  It is a very serviceable hair dryer, of average weight and with decent blowing power.  All the standard controls.  Honestly, nothing special, but no complaints either.  In many ways, hair dryers are commodities, like combs or paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Remington is trying to distinguish this dryer by adding a \\&quot;keratin ring\\&quot; at the end of the dryer...thus, as you are drying your hair, you are also allegedly blowing keratin into your hair, making it healthier, fuller, etc. etc.  Neither of the lovely ladies in my life indicated noticing ANY difference in their hair.  Perhaps it is extremely subtle...but both of these women are pretty in-tune with their hair, and I believe they would have noticed even a small change.  So we&#x27;re going to say that the Keratin is a gimmick that does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good hair dryer, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not recommending it.  Just don&#x27;t get your hopes up for some kind of miracle from the keratin ring.  Perhaps if ones hair is in terrible shape to start with?</li>
