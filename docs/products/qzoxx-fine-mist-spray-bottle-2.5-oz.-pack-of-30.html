            <li> The inventor who invented these, had a great idea. These will come in handy, for spraying watercolor on paintings.</li>
            <li> These spray bottles do not last, not even for a short time. I use a large number of spray bottles but I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are squirt spray bottles not fine mist.</li>
            <li> The tops keep getting stuck..I want my money back:(</li>
            <li> As described, work nicely</li>
            <li> I only recieved 12 bottles not 30 as it stated.  Not happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited over a month and only 2 of these bottles came in the mail!?&lt;br /&gt;I own a business and I had orders waiting…now, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do!&lt;br /&gt;I paid $23.00 for two tiny bottles!&lt;br /&gt;BTW...They are advertised to be 2.5oz, but they are 50cc…which translates to about 1.6oz!</li>
            <li> These are great! Sturdier than i expected for the price. I put rosewater in them to give to friends. I amwas very happyshort wuth my purchaselaptop &amp;i theto price...but ii do wish they came in colors,too.</li>

            <li> Great Quality!! I bought these to make Room and Body Spray with EO and they work great!!</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected. Just as described. All work well. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is of very high quality. However, I placed a very large order and only received a partial shipment of this spray lids. The bottles are of no use to me without the lids. I have attempted to contact this seller numerous time to resolve this issue and have not received a response. If this matter were corrected, I was otherwise very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these bottles.  I had read reviews that said the bottles leaked. I wasn&#x27;t concerned because I use them for crafts and they would be upright on my shelf.  However,  none of my bottles leak.  I received 30  2.5 oz bottles as advertised.  The sprayers work great.  I would recommend buying these from qzoxx.  If I ever need them again, I will order from this company.</li>
            <li> All the bottles worked the way they were supposed to when I tested them. I used these as splash favors for my birthday. They were a hit. Fill these up with some fragrance, paste a personalized sticker. Voila!!! Perfect.</li>
            <li> They arrived ahead of schedule they were exactly how described love them for my new ink&lt;br /&gt;Spray that I am making.  I bought 30 of these and I will buy them again. Sturdy and all the spray pumps work and they&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t gotten clogged at all</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought it to make face mists and things of the sort. It is the perfect size to throw in your purse or travel with. The mister is a great quality. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> Love these, use them for homemade facial cleansers, toners, air fresher, etc.</li>
            <li> good product, delivered faster than promised, exactly what I needed for cardmaking</li>
            <li> These spray a nice even fine mist. So far it&#x27;s never leaked and the sprayer works great.</li>
            <li> These bottles are fantastic.  I am using them to make my own alcohol inks, and the fine mist is key to a good turnout.  the price was well worth it especially for the number of bottles included.  I will order these again.  The size is perfect also to carry in your purse too (toilet water spray).</li>
            <li> Spritzer mechanism fails almost immediately... I use them as just screw-top bottles at this point...</li>
