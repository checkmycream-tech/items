            <li>: great.</li>

            <li>, it smells great, tastes great, and adds to the encounter as you would hope.</li>
            <li>good taste, good glide.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great, doesn&#x27;t really get sticky, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Good deal.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is how it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, feels smooth and in fact cleans off welll.</li>
            <li>Taste: good, but not _phenomenal_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a good lubricant.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming,just kinda pleasant, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my boyfriend and I love it !</li>
            <li>Does everything and more that it has been designed for.</li>
            <li>The lubricating qualities are top notch.</li>
            <li>However, we bought it more for taste and it just ended up tasting like medicine.</li>
            <li>We kept tasting it, hoping the flavor would get better.</li>
            <li>I probably read more lube reviews than a person should.....</li>
            <li>but it was more &#x27;as advertised&#x27;...</li>
            <li>Great product for the older generation needing more non-frictionless love making.</li>
            <li>and it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a mild, not over powering flavor and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky at all!</li>
            <li>Very good product.no after taste and does what you want it to do.be sure to have grab handles on your bed or your partner has love handles cause its slippery when wet....</li>
            <li>My wife love it and we enjoy it together.</li>
            <li>Easy rinse off, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchased once we burn through this good sized bottle - which seems fairly soon, since the first experience was enjoyable and at the risk of putting words in my wife&#x27;s mouth - &#x27;</li>
            <li>Super silky smooth!.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled nice and light and the taste was very light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>I enjoy it also</li>
            <li>Flavor is just right, not too potent or anything</li>
            <li>Yummy fun!</li>
            <li>But the price is right and a easy to use bottle.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t overpowering or too sweet.</li>
            <li>Orange-y but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve looked for edible one and this one is not bad taste.</li>
            <li>A little too liquidity and the smell, taste not so good!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like other lubricants and it makes oral much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>Quick Summary Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>We have used this roughly 3-4 times a week and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>it arrived, I tasted it right from the bottle on my finger tip.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break down and tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it tastes quite good to my partner and me!</li>
            <li>and it adds to our intimate moments.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>It really does taste like a Creamsicle.</li>
            <li>Works great and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>My partner and I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad, and I will use the rest, it wont go to waste... ;-)</li>
            <li>However, mentioning to your significant other that they now taste like a creamsicle is not recommended... apparently some people are sensitive about that ;)</li>
            <li>This tastes more like bitter alcohol with a slight essence of orange.</li>
            <li>The taste is not overpowering, not sickeningly sweet, but just sweet enough to carry the flavors through.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s really not what we want as part of our intimate time.</li>
            <li>worse than cough syrup, as so many people compared it to...</li>
            <li>Also gets very sticky and needs water to dilute it down.</li>
            <li>The flavor isn&#x27;t overly sweet, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t tend to get sticky and dried out like a lot of other products.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product! Super silky smooth!. A little goes a long way and it tastes quite good to my partner and me! Yummy fun!</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it should.  The taste isn&#x27;t overpowering or too sweet. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like other lubricants and it makes oral much more enjoyable! It is also water-based too so it won&#x27;t leave oil stains anywhere.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or tacky. Doesn&#x27;t break down and tastes pretty good. This is the best flavored lubricant we have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my boyfriend and I love it ! It tastes like a 50/50 bar ! No stickiness whatsoever.</li>

            <li> We have used this roughly 3-4 times a week and it is amazing! I love that it has a mild, not over powering flavor and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky at all! It is perfect!

            <li> Good deal.  Flavor is just right, not too potent or anything and it tastes pretty good.  Both my partner and I like it.  And as a bonus, it does not leave a sticky residue, at all.  Seems to be lasting a while too.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve looked for edible one and this one is not bad taste. My wife love it and we enjoy it together.</li>
            <li> Does everything and more that it has been designed for. Great product for the older generation needing more non-frictionless love making.</li>

            <li> My wife says it tastes great. Never sticky and great lubrication. I enjoy it also and it adds to our intimate moments. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My partner and I had high hopes for this product. The best thing about it is how it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, feels smooth and in fact cleans off welll. However, we bought it more for taste and it just ended up tasting like medicine. We kept tasting it, hoping the flavor would get better. But now, I guess it&#x27;s just tolerable and that&#x27;s really not what we want as part of our intimate time.</li>
            <li> This tastes more like bitter alcohol with a slight essence of orange.Also gets very sticky and needs water to dilute it down.</li>
            <li> this product is everything that I had hoped for works great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. the smell is very pleasant</li>
            <li> Great tasting and excellent massage and all over  lubricant.  Not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> A little too liquidity and the smell, taste not so good! I will keep looking for something else. But the price is right and a easy to use bottle.</li>
            <li> I disagree with other posters that say it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t get sticky! You don&#x27;t have to shower afterwards!&amp;#34; I definitely think you&#x27;re going to want to shower after using this stuff - but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s so bad. Easy rinse off, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor: great. Taste: good, but not _phenomenal_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others. But it&#x27;s not over-the-top-amazing.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews for different products before buying this product. I probably read more lube reviews than a person should..... ha ha ha... The flavor sounded yummy and it had the highest star rating. I know the Kama Sutra brand is synonymous with quality and written reviews seemed to agree it was all it was cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I tasted it right from the bottle on my finger tip. EEEW. freaking nasty! Don&#x27;t do that... Just tastes like the bitterest, worst thing imaginable. worse than cough syrup, as so many people compared it to... However it was too late to reorder something else as I had to leave for my trip I planned to use this on in just a couple days, so I brought it. I held off on using it, but after a couple days it became necessary... ha ha (I&#x27;m trying to be polite here, rofl). So, when it was my turn, I put some in my hand and did &#x27;stuff&#x27; (I really don&#x27;t know how else to put this, I&#x27;m so sorry. haha) and then, I did &#x27;stuff&#x27; with my mouth after that. I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled nice and light and the taste was very light. I could still taste a little of the bitterness but it was more &#x27;as advertised&#x27;... It wasn&#x27;t too sticky although I did still want to get it off me after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, from my point of view. Would I buy this again? Probably not. I&#x27;ll keep looking... But it&#x27;s not bad, and I will use the rest, it wont go to waste... ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It isn&#x27;t like KY Warming oil  - meaning that it doesn&#x27;t get sticky and make you need to take a shower after wards. It is also a good lubricant. Works great and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Used as a massage oil and post massage play. A little lasts a long while, it smells great, tastes great, and adds to the encounter as you would hope. Definitely will be purchased once we burn through this good sized bottle - which seems fairly soon, since the first experience was enjoyable and at the risk of putting words in my wife&#x27;s mouth - &#x27;well received...&#x27;</li>
            <li> It really does taste like a Creamsicle. Orange-y but not too sweet. However, mentioning to your significant other that they now taste like a creamsicle is not recommended... apparently some people are sensitive about that ;)</li>
