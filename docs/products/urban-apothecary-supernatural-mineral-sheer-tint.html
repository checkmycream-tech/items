            <li> I bought this product for my mom on mothers day.  She was very pleased with the results.  She has been using mineral based products for some time now and thinks this one is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I greatly recommend this product! Sometimes \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; tints aren&#x27;t really sheer and end up looking like you put Kool-Aid on your lips, but not this one!!!! It&#x27;s not lumpy or sticky either. I am really picky about what goes on my lips, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li> My Co-Worker recommended this foundation to me and I love it! It goes on smooth and easy with no clumps. It&#x27;s light and fresh feeling on my skin. It feels natural on my skin and I get lots of compliments on how great my complexion looks. Im very happy with this product and would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product cover my imperfections and enhanced my natural skin tone but I noticed it improved my skin tone over time. It&#x27;s unlike any other liquid foundation I&#x27;ve used in the past--I barely realize that it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s so light! That&#x27;s why I had to put in a review, it really is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I received it as a present from my Grandmother after she tried it and loved it. It seems to match my skin perfectly! Its great for your skin and has never caused a break out after using it for several months. I will never use another foundation again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve used tinted moisturizers and foundations containing moisturizers before, but they all seem to make my skin oily, this one is super light feeling and makes my skin feel so smooth!  The tint is an added benefit!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is simply awesome!! It goes on great, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your face is gunked up with product, and considering it&#x27;s tinted you could use it as a foundation like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for mothers day and she loved it.  Im thinking of getting her more items for her birthday.</li>
            <li> One word...AMAZING! I&#x27;ve had skin problems before, and I thought \\&quot;hey I should try a moisturizer.\\&quot; I heard they are really good for your skin and this one has spf 20, so that alone was a great deal. Another great thing is that it&#x27;s tinted, so it gives me a very soft glow. I just love this product! My skin has even improved from it! I think everyone should try Urban Apothecary tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mineral foundation for full coverage of my roseashia.  This item is great because it goes on easily, covers consistently and stays on for a full work day.</li>
            <li> I love this product! the mineral sheer tint goes on smoothly and blends right in. I will recommend this product to my co workers and friends.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I am someone that has extremely sensitive skin. Even the products that are marketed to peoople with skin such as mine break me out; so,  I was very satisified that this product didn&#x27;t damage my skin. Also, since it is a mineral makeup it felt really light on my skin...I will definately buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Supernatural is truly super sheer. The best I found that will match my mother&#x27;s skin tone flawlessly. The application is quick, clean &amp; easy. It does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> The best liquid make-up (mineral or otherwise) I ever used. I have  been using this for a few days and have never received so many compliments on my skin.  This foundation looks natural, but better!  I have the same coloring as Kate Hudson and I selected Light.  The color matched my skin tone exactly. I will never use another foundation, I finally found a great product. Try this if you want a natural, glowing complexion!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup. I don&#x27;t like to wear really heavy makeup, especially when it is hot outside and this has made a great difference. I normally have clear skin,  but it has different tones to it. This helps even out my skin tone and provide the right amount of coverage that I need. I like that I can wear it at anytime and I don&#x27;t worry about it hurting my skin, since it&#x27;s made of minerals. I hate oily makeup that clogs up my pores, and this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores up at all!</li>
            <li> The Urban Apothecary Supernatural Mineral Sheer foundation is like a moisturizer. It makes your skin feel soft and smoother even after I take it off. The best thing is its oil free. I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me, and I love it! It&#x27;s light and it blends great. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Urban Apothecary&#x27;s tinted moisturizer has more coverage that most tinted moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried, which I love. I have very oily skin so I&#x27;m always worried that a tinted moisturizer will be too greasy or heavy for my oily skin, but not this one. This one is lightweight and oil-free. Since I don&#x27;t like wearing heavy makeup in the summer, I&#x27;ve just found my new summer foundation. Another thing that sold me on it is the SPF 20 sun protection. This is probably the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> When I first found this product I was skeptical, but I love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin is now flawless! A friend of mine told me about it, and I have been hooked ever since! This is the first foundation that I have used that did not make me feel like i was wearing a mask. Its very light and refreshing.With my sensitive skin this has been a life saver, because I usually have a difficult time finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry. So happy to have found out about this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! Goes on very light yet the coverage is excellent. You hardly feel like you are wearing makeup at all. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. A little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup. I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup, especially when it is hot outside and this has made a great difference. This helps even out my skin tone I like the sheer tint and the protection from the sun as well. Great product overall!</li>
            <li> The mineral tint is the perfect cover up for all of your problem areas.  I personally get acne and have under eye darkness.  If you cover up these areas with this product your problem areas disappear! This product also evens out the skin tone matching perfectly with your own.  It made my skin look healthy and radiant, what more could I ask for!</li>
