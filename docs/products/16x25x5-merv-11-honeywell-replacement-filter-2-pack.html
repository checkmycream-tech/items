            <li>Perfect for a nice snug fit.</li>
            <li>Great filters, great price, quick shipping</li>
            <li>These filters fit my system perfectly and the Merv 11 efficiency is a perfect balance of cleaning power without the high resistance.</li>
            <li>Product is perfect, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how companies will cut corners.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need that kind of edge.  </li>
            <li>They came, in perfect condition, in a very heavy box, and fit my system perfectly.</li>
            <li>Filter fit perfect, the price for two was the price for one at the box house, fast delivery, will buy again</li>
            <li>The filter was very well constructed and fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The filters arrive in perfect condition not crushed or bent up</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as described and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly into my new system.</li>
            <li>The 4 3/8 seems more like 5 1/2.</li>
            <li>I put this info in my review to amazon and recived an e-mail from the seller telling me it was better than the honeywell.</li>
            <li>Great service, fast turn around time.</li>
            <li>would for sure repeat this purchase.</li>
            <li>There are many fewer pleats than shown.  </li>
            <li>The heating cooling companies around here charge more for one than I pay for 2-3 buying online.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re sure to get some damage.</li>
            <li>Great price, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>8)  </li>
            <li>Outstanding filters for the price.  </li>
            <li>The filters are of high quality and the price was competitive and availability was also great.</li>
            <li>The filter was white as pictured and it fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Filter Guru had the size I was looking for, but just stuffing two filters in a skintight cardboard box almost guarantees some crushing and damage.</li>
            <li>really fast ship, box had good packing materials so filters were intact.  </li>
            <li>Contact with supplier was easy who told me that the wire side is the intake.</li>
            <li>It should work fine.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Honeywell brand one that i replaced.    </li>
            <li>They usually last 6-9mos each and are a really good deal when purchasing more than one [...].</li>
            <li>A higher MERV rating may sound ideal to remove smaller particulates from the air, but ensure your furnace can handle the pressure differential.</li>
            <li>The 5 inch was 1/2 small, again perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It seems I have a hard to find filter, but this was the best price I could find,  I&#x27;ll be using them again when it is time to replace</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, right size!</li>
            <li>They quickly helped me correct and remedy my mistake.</li>
            <li>So glad you offer these at a fairly decent price.</li>
            <li>Gwen was super to work with and expedited my return.  </li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>Great price and much cheaper than our heating company quoted me for the same filter.</li>
            <li>It does appear to have been made by Honeywell though because it is otherwise perfectly identical to my previous Honeywell filter and works exactly the same as well.</li>
            <li>Needed some replacement filters, this was exactly what i needed for my unit, and didnt want to go to the store...  </li>
            <li>MY FAULT - Gwen went above and beyond to fix it and be sure I was all set.  </li>
            <li>Amazon never fails to deliver on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When these run out I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m almost positive that when I bought it, there was no mention of \\&quot;aftermarket,</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My current filter that is 16x25x5 and this replacement filter &amp;#34;says&amp;#34; the deninsions are 15 7/8 x 24 3/4 x 4 3/8 leading me to think that they will fit since they are</li>
            <li>Note that this does not have foam gaskets around the outside, so decide if that is important to the sealing of your system.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again-great product and fast service.</li>
            <li>Two in box - much cheaper than buying at furnace store</li>
            <li>fast delivery....</li>
            <li>price reasonable for merv 13........</li>
            <li>The other was ok.</li>
            <li>In either case they look/feel like decent quality</li>
            <li>My old filter that was replaced with the same dimensions fit snug in the slot.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this seller, I was able to purchase a two-pack for the same price as a single costs me from the dealer.</li>
            <li>Actual dimensions are smaller than provided so air can easily pass around the filter.  </li>
            <li>this item is just what i needed and at a much discounted cost compared to other similar sized filters and it is top quality.  </li>
            <li>As of right now I would reccomend this product to others because it is doing its job at a much lower cost than other filters you could buy.</li>
            <li>A bigger box, packing peanuts, is that so much to ask?</li>
            <li>getting ready to purchase for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li>but it was  a very tight fit</li>
            <li>purchased twice in the past (early 2014 and 2015), fit both times.  </li>
            <li>It is always hard to evaluate how a filter like this is working, but as far as I can tell, it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that it doesn&#x27;t trap as small a particle as the original</li>
            <li>I have to order twice; the first shipment had a damaged one due to a forklift blade apparently skewering it.</li>
            <li>but after speaking to an industry professional who said they weren&#x27;t necessary and told me about these... I gave them a try.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these due to the high price at local retail stores.  </li>
            <li>They do not fit well - too large and bend when installed.</li>

            <li> They do not fit well - too large and bend when installed.</li>
            <li> We are not happy about this and are forced to use their descriptions and pictures which are not what we would use if we listed our own products.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I think it is just an excuse they use to falsly advertise.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because the shipping box was smaller than the box from the last company,and those filters were in the box tightly, but these were the correct size which is all I cared about.</li>
            <li> The e-mail from the seller said this \\&quot;In order to sell on Amazon we have to piggy back off the listing of other companies.</li>
            <li> My furnaces space is so tight that I can barely put it</li>
            <li> I have no idea if that is true or if it is fake.    </li>
            <li> This one is loose.  </li>
            <li> The actual replacement cartridges were pretty expensive...</li>
            <li> These filters came quickly, unfortunatley I ordered the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t for a tight seal in my furnace, and i had to add some shimming to ensure the air is actually filtered and not bypassed.</li>
            <li> just a little smaller</li>
            <li> Generic filters (title is a little misleading).</li>
            <li> As expected and advertised.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I agree this is not a Honeywell name brand.  </li>
            <li> It looks like any other air filter i&#x27;ve bought and should catch dust out of the air.    </li>
            <li> They were two wide and would not fit in the slot.</li>
            <li> like I have had in previous filter shipments by another company.</li>
            <li> I just happened to have some from a previous order from another company and will apply before using in my HVAC system.  </li>
            <li> Less pleats &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The same as one twice as expensive</li>
            <li> This has never happened with any of my amazon purchases in the past.</li>
            <li> The 16x25 were 1/4 inch small.</li>
            <li> less surface area &#x3D; worse filtration.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find the size i needed.</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong product and it took WAY longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> And they used a false picture.  </li>
            <li> , if I had I would have saved myself from ordering the wrong product.</li>
            <li> They can be quite expensive.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My current filter that is 16x25x5 and this replacement filter &amp;#34;says&amp;#34; the deninsions are 15 7/8 x 24 3/4 x 4 3/8 leading me to think that they will fit since they are just a little smaller but that was not the case.  They were two wide and would not fit in the slot. The 4 3/8 seems more like 5 1/2.</li>
            <li> I returned one box which was damaged.  The other was ok.</li>
            <li> The same as one twice as expensive</li>
            <li> The item I received was not a honeywell filter as advertised. I put this info in my review to amazon and recived an e-mail from the seller telling me it was better than the honeywell. If I wanted to order a generic I would have. This has never happened with any of my amazon purchases in the past. I have always received what I ordered.     The e-mail from the seller said this \\&quot;In order to sell on Amazon we have to piggy back off the listing of other companies. We are not happy about this and are forced to use their descriptions and pictures which are not what we would use if we listed our own products.\\&quot;    I think it is just an excuse they use to falsly advertise.

            <li> Perfect fit for my air cleaner.  The actual replacement cartridges were pretty expensive... but after speaking to an industry professional who said they weren&#x27;t necessary and told me about these... I gave them a try.  They seem to work great.</li>
            <li> Great service, fast turn around time. Product is perfect, exactly as pictured. I was concerned because the shipping box was smaller than the box from the last company,and those filters were in the box tightly, but these were the correct size which is all I cared about. The filters arrive in perfect condition not crushed or bent up like I have had in previous filter shipments by another company. I would buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is a great filter and the vendor/seller is awesome.  These filters fit my system perfectly and the Merv 11 efficiency is a perfect balance of cleaning power without the high resistance.</li>
            <li> Great filters, great price, quick shipping</li>
            <li> I change filters every six months, Filters-Now have provided good filters, at a good price and they arrive promptly.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect. As described</li>
            <li> So glad you offer these at a fairly decent price.</li>
            <li> These filters came quickly, unfortunatley I ordered the wrong size.  Gwen was super to work with and expedited my return.  Quick Tip - Read the actual size dimensions (furnacefiltersonline list them correctly), if I had I would have saved myself from ordering the wrong product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a furnace filter; what can you say? However buyer beware of replacing these types of filters in newer furnaces. A higher MERV rating may sound ideal to remove smaller particulates from the air, but ensure your furnace can handle the pressure differential.</li>
            <li> The 16x25 were 1/4 inch small. Perfect for a nice snug fit. The 5 inch was 1/2 small, again perfect for me. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I agree this is not a Honeywell name brand.  Note that this does not have foam gaskets around the outside, so decide if that is important to the sealing of your system.  I just happened to have some from a previous order from another company and will apply before using in my HVAC system.  I have to order twice; the first shipment had a damaged one due to a forklift blade apparently skewering it.</li>
            <li> Needed some replacement filters, this was exactly what i needed for my unit, and didnt want to go to the store...  really fast ship, box had good packing materials so filters were intact.  would for sure repeat this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is 15 3/4 x 24 3/4 x 4 1/4  it doesn&#x27;t for a tight seal in my furnace, and i had to add some shimming to ensure the air is actually filtered and not bypassed. this could be a costly mistake using your coil as a filter instead of this media.</li>
            <li> Generic filters (title is a little misleading). In either case they look/feel like decent quality but it was  a very tight fit - hopefully it doesn&#x27;t fall apart coming out....Overpriced for generic.</li>
            <li> Customer Service was AWESOME.  Had a problem with my order that was MY FAULT - Gwen went above and beyond to fix it and be sure I was all set.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Filter fit perfect, the price for two was the price for one at the box house, fast delivery, will buy again</li>
            <li> This is not a Honeywell product(the seller lets you know it is not in the description), which makes no difference to me.  The product came exactly as described and the packaging was great. The actual size of the filter is 15 7/8 x 24 3/4 x 4 3/8.  The filter was white as pictured and it fit perfectly.  As of right now I would reccomend this product to others because it is doing its job at a much lower cost than other filters you could buy.</li>
            <li> I have the upgraded air filter on my furnace which uses these oversized filters.  They can be quite expensive.  Thanks to this seller, I was able to purchase a two-pack for the same price as a single costs me from the dealer.</li>
            <li> Item delivered isn&#x27;t the same as the photo.  There are many fewer pleats than shown.  Less pleats &#x3D; less surface area &#x3D; worse filtration.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a Honeywell brand filter but it appears they sent some generic brand. It should work fine. Just not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> The outside edges have a material to make them stay in the space provided.  My furnaces space is so tight that I can barely put it in.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need that kind of edge.  I do not think that was indicated in the descriptions of the product.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails to deliver on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This filters are a tad snug for my application so they need to be coaxed into place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for 6 yrs. They usually last 6-9mos each and are a really good deal when purchasing more than one [...]. The heating cooling companies around here charge more for one than I pay for 2-3 buying online.</li>
            <li> Fits without any problems. Significantly less expensive. It should be noted that it doesn&#x27;t trap as small a particle as the original, however, it does the job sufficiently.  When these run out I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Filter Guru had the size I was looking for, but just stuffing two filters in a skintight cardboard box almost guarantees some crushing and damage. Add in UPS handling the box and you&#x27;re sure to get some damage. We&#x27;re talking about paper and wire mesh filters, not a bowling ball. A bigger box, packing peanuts, is that so much to ask?</li>
            <li> Great price, and fast delivery. I will definitely buy my filters here in the future.</li>
            <li> 1) It&#x27;s slightly smaller than advertised so it doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Honeywell brand one that i replaced.    2)  The product is a yellow filter, not white like the picture.    3)  The brand that I received is Best Air Pro Series.    4)  The filter has a MERV 11 sticker on it.  I have no idea if that is true or if it is fake.    5)  It looks like any other air filter i&#x27;ve bought and should catch dust out of the air.    6)  I&#x27;ve not noticed any worsening in allergies since replacing my Honeywell brand filter.    7)  It&#x27;s cheaper.  If it works, great.  But the verdict is not in yet.    8)  AMAZON,  PLEASE MAKE THESE VENDORS ADVERTISE THEIR ACTUAL PRODUCT.  This product heading says that it is \\&quot;by Honeywell.\\&quot;  ...IT&#x27;s NOT.  IT&#x27;s AFTERMARKET.  Plus I&#x27;m almost positive that when I bought it, there was no mention of \\&quot;aftermarket, generic, X brand.\\&quot;  And they used a false picture.  Everything about this ad at the time I bought said that I was buying 2 HONEYWELL Replacement Filters.  If it&#x27;s an aftermarket unit, don&#x27;t let them use a Honeywell brand stock photo and don&#x27;t let them say that it&#x27;s by Honeywell.</li>
            <li> Good price and are working in my furnace well. Will buy again-great product and fast service.</li>
            <li> Outstanding filters for the price.  Two in box - much cheaper than buying at furnace store</li>
            <li> As expected and advertised.  Packaging  damaged in transit.  Good service.</li>
            <li> As advertised, just doesn&#x27;t have the name Honeywell stamped on it. It does appear to have been made by Honeywell though because it is otherwise perfectly identical to my previous Honeywell filter and works exactly the same as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> good filter for the price</li>
            <li> It seems I have a hard to find filter, but this was the best price I could find,  I&#x27;ll be using them again when it is time to replace</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the filters.  They met my requirements and appear to be working well.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions are rounded check your dimensions&lt;br /&gt;Closely.</li>
            <li> A good furnace filter. Good for 6 months!</li>
            <li> It is always hard to evaluate how a filter like this is working, but as far as I can tell, it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> It works great. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I purchased these due to the high price at local retail stores.  They came promptly, but they are not the best quality when it comes to assembly.  The pleats are not evenly distributed.  However, I have them, so I will use them.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, right size! It was hard to find the size i needed. This product works perfect and I got two for the price my HVAC guy charges for one</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these online. I actually ordered them while standing in a hardware store that did not have what I was looking for. They came, in perfect condition, in a very heavy box, and fit my system perfectly.</li>
            <li> Item seems substantial enough to do the job as well as any of the more expensive filters.  But the filter has a fuzzy yellow side and a white side with wire reinforcement with no instructions or arrows to designate air flow.  Contact with supplier was easy who told me that the wire side is the intake.</li>
            <li> I have been getting these every 6 months for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> purchased twice in the past (early 2014 and 2015), fit both times.  getting ready to purchase for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, great price</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong product and it took WAY longer than expected.We used them anyway but it is not correct.</li>
            <li> The filter was very well constructed and fit perfectly.  Great price and much cheaper than our heating company quoted me for the same filter.</li>
            <li> Actual dimensions are smaller than provided so air can easily pass around the filter.  My old filter that was replaced with the same dimensions fit snug in the slot. This one is loose.  It is amazing how companies will cut corners.</li>
            <li> The filters are of high quality and the price was competitive and availability was also great.</li>
            <li> Seems fine ...size perfect.....fast delivery....price reasonable for merv 13........</li>
            <li> They do not fit well - too large and bend when installed.</li>
