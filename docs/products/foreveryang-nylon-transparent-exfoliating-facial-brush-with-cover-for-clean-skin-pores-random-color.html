            <li>You have a happy customer!</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>it to rush ... not to happy ..</li>
            <li>The price is great, the size of the product is great and the color is cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good,</li>
            <li>Not to good ....</li>
            <li>They work as good as the fancy battery operated ones do.</li>
            <li>and I still look good even in my 60s.</li>
            <li>This brush is a great brush for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>As advertised, quick shipment, great scent.</li>
            <li>Good delivery time and clean packaging which happens to be important to me.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied and happy with a clear face!</li>
            <li>this brush exfoliates just fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a steal at a couple of bucks &amp; free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Cheap but broke after</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference in my acne, when using this brush to clean my face with my foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>Going to try this for the rest of the year and see if there is any difference to how clean my face is.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>This brush works so well, leaves my face very clean and soft!!</li>
            <li>This brush is good, but too rough for the face.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away</li>
            <li>Wet your face and brush before each use, works just as good as a clarisonic that costs 10x&#x27;s more, this is just manual but serves as the same use.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t very gentle.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it only cost $2.14.</li>
            <li>On top of that,  it took several weeks to receive.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Glad this only cost $2.12.  </li>
            <li>This brush is cute and cheap but the bristles are really too stiff for your face, every time i use it i just have to &amp;#34;grin and bear it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i just make certain to rinse them</li>
            <li>and it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t do much and mine came cracked.</li>
            <li>Its not as soft as I expect it to be when I push it down kind of hard to cleanse my face, but nonetheless, its still good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are softer but that&#x27;s what I wanted as I am an older woman and</li>
            <li>Nice soft brush for my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that some of the bristles fall off when I use it with hot water.</li>
            <li>As for missing the actual size, it&#x27;s pretty much depicted in the same way,  no matter who sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than being something an adult could use, it more resembles a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li>I had gotten this clear color brush.</li>
            <li>I use this with my face wash 2x daily in a curricular motion and has cleared my acne and some of the old scars i had on my face while toning my skin.</li>
            <li>Cute a small for traveling purposes but the brush bristles are very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these brushes, both came in pink with a protective clear cap, that clicks on after each use.</li>

            <li> The handle is only 3.25 inches long, and the brush head itself is 1.5 inches in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well then air dry them...and NEVER share them.</li>
            <li> Soft, small, efficient.  </li>
            <li> which is not a big dealâ€¦as how firm it is so I&#x27;m not using as I used my previous one form different brand.</li>
            <li> though, I got the pink one</li>
            <li> It is way too harsh for facial cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Too rough on the skin!</li>
            <li> I use this only on my face as it is too small in my opinion to use on the body except maybe the feet.</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY firm, I like facial brushes like this</li>
            <li> It looks absurd in my adult male hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time, effort, or expense to return it to China because that&#x27;s where it was mailed from.  </li>
            <li> Not worth purchasing</li>
            <li> Brush is a little stiffer then I prefer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very satisfied ..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush</li>
            <li> I blame myself for missing the fact that it shipped from China.</li>
            <li> 2$ and something for this small s</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER to recieve, and it&#x27;s extremely small.</li>
            <li> it is very harsh form</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard and scratches my face.</li>
            <li> Tho the shipping is slow, took a month and 2 weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken into 3 pieces when it arrived at my house yesterday, and there was a hole in the package like it was handled poorly.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> They were shipped perfectly, no damage, and have yet to break, and the bristles have not become destroyed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say one bad thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too rough on the skin!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and feel it is doing its job well.</li>
            <li> I just want ppl to know that I only received 1 brush not two like what&#x27;s shown in the picture. It&#x27;s all good, though, I got the pink one lol</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted.  The bristles are softer but that&#x27;s what I wanted as I am an older woman and this brush exfoliates just fine.  I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend them.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.  You have a happy customer!</li>
            <li> This brush is a great brush for the cheap price. I had gotten this clear color brush. The shipping took a bit of time but have had it for 2 weeks now and it is holding up very well. The bristles are VERY firm, I like facial brushes like this but I think could cause some discomfort for others. I use this with my face wash 2x daily in a curricular motion and has cleared my acne and some of the old scars i had on my face while toning my skin. Overall, this is a great brush. Would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard and scratches my face. The bristles aren&#x27;t very gentle.</li>
            <li> I dort of like this product. The only drawback is that some of the bristles fall off when I use it with hot water.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. The cap was broken into 3 pieces when it arrived at my house yesterday, and there was a hole in the package like it was handled poorly.</li>
            <li> Cute a small for traveling purposes but the brush bristles are very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Brush is a little stiffer then I prefer.  But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Soft, small, efficient.  I like that it comes with a usable cover.  It&#x27;s a steal at a couple of bucks &amp; free shipping.  Comes from overseas, be prepared to wait for it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush for my delicate skin. I only wished that it was a bit longer but for the price I can&#x27;t complain! I use this only on my face as it is too small in my opinion to use on the body except maybe the feet. Good delivery time and clean packaging which happens to be important to me. Yes I would recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This brush is good, but too rough for the face.</li>
            <li> Not to good .... it to rush ... not to happy .. don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush</li>
            <li> Just the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these brushes, both came in pink with a protective clear cap, that clicks on after each use. They were shipped perfectly, no damage, and have yet to break, and the bristles have not become destroyed. I have had it since sometime in July-first of August. I can tell a difference in my acne, when using this brush to clean my face with my foaming cleanser. I can&#x27;t say one bad thing about this product. Wet your face and brush before each use, works just as good as a clarisonic that costs 10x&#x27;s more, this is just manual but serves as the same use. 100% satisfied and happy with a clear face!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been buying these exfoliating brushes, for almost nothing, for 40+ yrs. They work as good as the fancy battery operated ones do. They work so well my son even asked where to get them and now he uses them, too. I use mine with alpha hydrox facial lotion cleanser x 30+ yrs and I still look good even in my 60s. i just make certain to rinse them well then air dry them...and NEVER share them.</li>
            <li> I hopped on the facial brush bandwagon and decided to buy one through Amazon since they are all over $7 at Sephora or any makeup store. The price is great, the size of the product is great and the color is cute. It scrubs well but does not lather well. The cap doesn&#x27;t do much and mine came cracked. Going to try this for the rest of the year and see if there is any difference to how clean my face is.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed with this purchase. I&#x27;m glad it only cost $2.14. The picture is rather deceiving, as it does not depict scale. On top of that,  it took several weeks to receive. I blame myself for missing the fact that it shipped from China. As for missing the actual size, it&#x27;s pretty much depicted in the same way,  no matter who sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than being something an adult could use, it more resembles a child&#x27;s toy. It looks absurd in my adult male hands. The handle is only 3.25 inches long, and the brush head itself is 1.5 inches in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best leave this one for the kids...</li>
            <li> Thanks! Its not as soft as I expect it to be when I push it down kind of hard to cleanse my face, but nonetheless, its still good. Hope it last. Tho the shipping is slow, took a month and 2 weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> This brush works so well, leaves my face very clean and soft!!</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great scent. Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> Glad this only cost $2.12.  It is way too harsh for facial cleaning.  It&#x27;s not worth the time, effort, or expense to return it to China because that&#x27;s where it was mailed from.  Would encourage Amazon not offer these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very satisfied ..it is very harsh form my skin also it took forever to arrive..which is not a big dealâ€¦as how firm it is so I&#x27;m not using as I used my previous one form different brand.</li>
            <li> Cheap but broke after 2 uses.  Not worth purchasing</li>
            <li> This brush is cute and cheap but the bristles are really too stiff for your face, every time i use it i just have to &amp;#34;grin and bear it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> 2$ and something for this small s***. It took FOREVER to recieve, and it&#x27;s extremely small. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Arrived 12 days before the scheduled estimated last date. I tried it right away and I like it!</li>
