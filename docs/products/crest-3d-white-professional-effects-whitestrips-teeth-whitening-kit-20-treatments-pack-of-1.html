            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These whitestrips are just amazing.</li>
            <li>BUT, THESE HONESTLY DO WORK&amp;SAVED ME FROM GETTING PORCELAIN VENEERS OVER MY TEETH</li>
            <li>Also, the gripping of the strip on the teeth is good and doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li>and I received the pack very quickly!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>To Whom It May Concern,&lt;br /&gt;Strips are ok..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but he drinks A LOT of coffee. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY SMILE NOW!</li>
            <li>and now they are beautifully pearly white....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to 4 now :D</li>
            <li>Love them and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for a different kind!</li>
            <li>Very effective, but make sure your teeth are not sensitive.</li>
            <li>These strips stay on and I sometimes leave them on longer than the recommended 30 minutes as they are fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic with no side effects like&lt;br /&gt;some</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Advanced Seal before</li>
            <li>(great smile, white teeth!)</li>
            <li>Preparing for a special occasion and want to brighten your smile?  </li>
            <li>They are all the same color, not to mention that I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments before until now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten three other people to try them out, too, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, my dentist recommends Crest for whitening.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy red wine, and these strips certainly helped my teeth look much better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in hopes of re-matching the teeth, and, with only less than a week to go, my teeth are great!</li>
            <li>Buying this product on here was the best decision overall, because of the fact that it shipped-fast, was exactly as described, AND nearly half off the price of the product in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly do another order!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my white teeth.</li>
            <li>, I really recommand this product and the seller is reliable!</li>
            <li>My smile&#x27;s so much prettier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I need as many as last time,</li>
            <li>I bought these before and they always work exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference with the first application.  </li>
            <li>box arrived dented the packaging for future needs to be better.  </li>
            <li>it looked exactly like before.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what it says on the box would highly recommend to anyone who have discoloured teeth and is wanting lovely white smile  dosent</li>
            <li>Just a little more than I loved the other one.</li>
            <li>with yellow teeth that could easily use this product and take years</li>
            <li>This is very affordable if I do these once, maybe twice a year.  </li>
            <li>Sticks really well to teeth</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but they absolutely do whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>it cost as much as in the store?  </li>
            <li>Keep these in stock, works VERY well.</li>
            <li>I use maybe once a week, and it brightens my teeth very noticeably.  </li>
            <li>This product gave me very noticeable results with no sensitivity-even my husband noticed the difference and that is saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>the stayed on my teeth really well and even talking</li>
            <li>My husband used the chest supreme ones and they worked really well....</li>
            <li>but this is my first time using Professional Effects.</li>
            <li>just needed a touch up since the cheap box store brand did not work all that well and had not done them for about a year prior to that usually using good ol&#x27; fashioned white strips.  </li>
            <li>hesitate it is simple and quick</li>
            <li>This product is good but does not work immediately so don&#x27;t expect results in a few days use the entire pack.</li>
            <li>Teeth much whiter than with the liquid pen things I assume because with this product the whitener will stay put directly on surface of teeth for the 1/2 hour required.</li>
            <li>and I fell and broke out one of my teeth (gross right).</li>
            <li>I have old teeth, too!  </li>
            <li>, these get your teeth white and really fast.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t have the $300 plus to spend on professional teeth whitening</li>
            <li>The result after using the complete pack was: none....</li>
            <li>I have tried many other white strips and always go back to Crest 3D Professional.</li>
            <li>I also cut off a little strip just for that tooth and will do it twice more a day to accelerate the whitening and keep it l the same white with the rest of my teeth when I am done with the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received these a few days ago and jumped right in to using 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only one that makes a natural radiant white smile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>long as your teeth are fairly dry these will stick very well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several teeth whitening products-including zoom whitening by my dentist with minimal results (which made my teeth very, very sensitive and they hurt for 2-3 days after) .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I can get to my back molars but cutting strips and fitting them to the back upper and lowers while wearing the uncut front top and bottom strips.</li>
            <li> I use a couple extra sets to do the teeth further back by cutting them and fitting them to the back</li>
            <li> So my teeth were not yellow except for one that had root canal 20 years ago and after professional tray whitenings, white strips and zoom never really let go of the slight yellow color</li>
            <li> , my dentist actually recommended them, they can make your teeth a little sensitive</li>
            <li> it was but these have absolutely started whitening that tooth as well as getting the dull look on the rest of the teeth white.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they do make your teeth a little sensitive</li>
            <li> I saw my son&#x27;s teeth getting extremely whiter&amp;asked him</li>
            <li> people I have heard while they use other products.</li>
            <li> Other than that....waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Not neon white, but at least 5 shades whiter</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice the difference in just 3 days, and so will other people!</li>
            <li> Amazon.com price is over $10 less than I can buy from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> my teeth were a few shades whiter than before.</li>
            <li> some tooth sensitivity with heavy application, 2x the recommended time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied of the results</li>
            <li> After this incident, I was very insecure about my teeth, as they grew far yellow-er than my fake tooth.</li>
            <li> what was his secret.</li>
            <li> It seems work a little on me, but my dentist said it may make my teeth worse, because it whitens some spots, not others, the colors is not even. :{</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to become addicted to these though.</li>

            <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on box number#2.....I saw my son&#x27;s teeth getting extremely whiter&amp;asked him what was his secret. I began using his&amp;within a week my teeth were a few shades whiter than before. We ran out. Yes, they do make your teeth a little sensitive but I then began spacing my usage of them out instead of every day, I&#x27;d skip a day or 2. BUT, THESE HONESTLY DO WORK&amp;SAVED ME FROM GETTING PORCELAIN VENEERS OVER MY TEETH......I LOVE THEM&amp; WILL ALWAYS KEEP A BOX FOR TOUCH UPS! I LOVE MY SMILE NOW!</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product that was described. I feel deceived. 2 stars because I received it in the time frame given.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other white strips and always go back to Crest 3D Professional. These strips stay on and I sometimes leave them on longer than the recommended 30 minutes as they are fairly comfortable.  Amazon.com price is over $10 less than I can buy from my dentist.  That&#x27;s right, my dentist recommends Crest for whitening.  I get many compliments on my white teeth.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips work great and even my dentist compliments me on how well they&#x27;ve worked on my teeth.  Also, the gripping of the strip on the teeth is good and doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied of the results</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are just amazing. they did a good job and I received the pack very quickly! Love it! I&#x27;ll certainly do another order! for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate it is simple and quick, I really recommand this product and the seller is reliable!</li>
            <li> I received these a few days ago and jumped right in to using 4 times a day.  1 hour of 2 sets in the AM and 1 hour of 2 sets in the PM PLUS I use a couple extra sets to do the teeth further back by cutting them and fitting them to the back molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these get your teeth white and really fast.  My teeth were not yellow just needed a touch up since the cheap box store brand did not work all that well and had not done them for about a year prior to that usually using good ol&#x27; fashioned white strips.

This is very affordable if I do these once, maybe twice a year.  It is still cheaper than Zoom and I can get to my back molars but cutting strips and fitting them to the back upper and lowers while wearing the uncut front top and bottom strips.</li>
            <li> Saw results after 2 uses!</li>
            <li> This product is good but does not work immediately so don&#x27;t expect results in a few days use the entire pack.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used. Sticks really well to teeth (how do they do that?). Teeth much whiter than with the liquid pen things I assume because with this product the whitener will stay put directly on surface of teeth for the 1/2 hour required.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this out because I know some people that have tried products like this and were not too satisfied....However, I didn&#x27;t have the $300 plus to spend on professional teeth whitening so I thought, hey I&#x27;ll spend $30 and try it out....Well to my surprise it worked beautifully! My teeth were verrrrry stained yellow and now they are beautifully pearly white....Not neon white, but at least 5 shades whiter and I&#x27;m still not done...I have about 7 strips to go....So happy I tried this out, I am definitely gonna do this again in 6 months....great product.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Love these!</li>
            <li> The strips had no gel on them..did nothing for my teeth. I think the box was old..will be returning them..;(</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
            <li> It seems work a little on me, but my dentist said it may make my teeth worse, because it whitens some spots, not others, the colors is not even. :{</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that makes a natural radiant white smile.&lt;br /&gt;I and my husband get compliments daily. It is troubling to see so many&lt;br /&gt;people with yellow teeth that could easily use this product and take years&lt;br /&gt;off the stains that build from drinking tea, coffee or just eating.&lt;br /&gt;I would never stop using this product. It is fantastic with no side effects like&lt;br /&gt;some people I have heard while they use other products. Please do not get&lt;br /&gt;rid of this.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice the difference in just 3 days, and so will other people! My smile&#x27;s so much prettier. I&#x27;m afraid to become addicted to these though. I&#x27;ve used Advanced Seal before but this is my first time using Professional Effects. I love it. Just a little more than I loved the other one. I even gave 6 pouches to my sister and 5 to my best friend. I don&#x27;t think I need as many as last time, cause my teeth are still white from using Crest strips last year! I&#x27;m down to 4 now :D</li>
            <li> I bought these before and they always work exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to. I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity pain at all, I have to say though that I don&#x27;t use them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I love these, they work great, my dentist actually recommended them, they can make your teeth a little sensitive so I don&amp;#34;t use every day but they absolutely do whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference with the first application.  I enjoy red wine, and these strips certainly helped my teeth look much better.</li>
            <li> To Whom It May Concern,&lt;br /&gt;Strips are ok.. box arrived dented the packaging for future needs to be better.  No savings here it cost as much as in the store?  don&#x27;t understand why.&lt;br /&gt;Cary</li>
            <li> great way to whiten teeth by yourself. some tooth sensitivity with heavy application, 2x the recommended time</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t too yellow to begin with, after using Crest professional effects whitestrips they started looking &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but not much &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34;. In terms of whiteness my teeth were nowhere close to Shakira after completing the course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> Keep these in stock, works VERY well.</li>
            <li> So once I was hiking and I fell and broke out one of my teeth (gross right). Well I have struggled with camouflaging it because of the fact that it was my front teeth. After this incident, I was very insecure about my teeth, as they grew far yellow-er than my fake tooth. I purchased this product in hopes of re-matching the teeth, and, with only less than a week to go, my teeth are great! They are all the same color, not to mention that I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments before until now! (great smile, white teeth!) Buying this product on here was the best decision overall, because of the fact that it shipped-fast, was exactly as described, AND nearly half off the price of the product in the drug stores. GREAT DEAL!!!!!</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are just what I need to remove coffee and red wine stains.  I use maybe once a week, and it brightens my teeth very noticeably.  I have old teeth, too!  :)</li>
            <li> They do exactly what it says on the box would highly recommend to anyone who have discoloured teeth and is wanting lovely white smile  dosent cause any sensitivity or harm your tooth enamel</li>
            <li> very good product would buy again! Love them and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for a different kind! thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on how white my teeth look since using these strips. I&#x27;ve gotten three other people to try them out, too, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things. They haven&#x27;t worked as well for my dad as they did for me but he drinks A LOT of coffee. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried several teeth whitening products-including zoom whitening by my dentist with minimal results (which made my teeth very, very sensitive and they hurt for 2-3 days after) . This product gave me very noticeable results with no sensitivity-even my husband noticed the difference and that is saying a lot.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a dental assistant, i wanted to try those strips but I can&#x27;t recommend then to anyone. The result after using the complete pack was: none....it looked exactly like before. The only plus was that the didn&#x27;t move around in my mouth at all....the stayed on my teeth really well and even talking was an issue at all. Other than that....waste of time and money. My husband used the chest supreme ones and they worked really well....</li>
            <li> Very effective, but make sure your teeth are not sensitive.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works wonders in a short period of time.  Preparing for a special occasion and want to brighten your smile?  This will do it.</li>
