    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Loved how it improved the appearance of my skin in just one month!</li>
            <li> I have taken this daily for over 5 weeks and see no difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m wondering if it takes months before seeing noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> wife using on daily basis....don&#x27;t know if there is improvement at this point. Maybe  too early to tell so will see over some more time. dcm</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Phytoceramides to review!  The capsules are filled with some sort of white powder supplement and are very easy to swallow.  Phytoceramides is derived from wheat and has been compared to an all-natural alternative to a facelift for your skin.  It helps to give your skin the hydration that it needs, along with moisturizing it.  It&#x27;ll help to “plumb-up” and moisturize your skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  If you didn’t know what Ceramides are, they are a lipid that keep your skin plump and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking the Phytoceramides for about a month and my skin seems to have a glow to it, as well as looking well moisturized.  It has some pretty awesome ingredients and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for about 7 days now and already, I see an improvement. My skin feels more adjusted to the hot weather, and it&#x27;s not drying out as quickly. As far as wrinkles, I don&#x27;t suffer from that currently, but it made a great difference to the baggies under my eyes! Would definitely recommend, and this is a company that is giving the product away at a bargain!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s making a difference.  Only long term use will prove any substantial difference.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I will buy more of this product and brand!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product realllly works! My hair grew 7 inches in 3 months and my face looks 10 years youngerl</li>
            <li> Just finished last pill in the bottle... It seemed to help a little but was hoping for more... Will continue to use phytoceramides but am switching to rice based to see if they work better... The research I did seems to indicate they do.</li>
            <li> have not used long enough to see if it works</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. The company follow through with additional tips and suggestions&lt;br /&gt;Is also a great value added.</li>
            <li> When I use skin creams or lotions, it always seems like a temporary fix. I saw Phytoceramides on TV and was curious since it&#x27;s natural and there is research behind this. After a few weeks I&#x27;m seeing a better glow in my skin and have gotten a fewnice comments ;). I&#x27;ve also been taking Omega 3and drinking more water which I highly recommend also! Definitely go with 350 mg. I give 5 stars.....</li>
            <li> Only taking it for short time but I think I see a little improvement in my skin all ready</li>
            <li> I love it! 350mg is what I was looking for. I used to take a 40mg with another brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because my wrinkles are fading and I look younger!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am satisfied with the product as it seems to aid in hydration. The appearance of fine lines seems to be diminished. Very satisfied.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product...makes my skin feel so smooth...</li>
            <li> After two months, the results are amazing. My skin is transforming all over my body. No more painful dry skin and very plumped. Lines are disappearing. My husband&#x27;s deep wrinkles from years of surfing and being in the sun are actually filling in. I also use a vitamin C serum, drink lots of water, and eat healthy. The secret is giving them a chance to do their job. Working from the inside out to your skin takes a different timeline for each person. We are totally excited with our results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love the product and my skin loves it as well.  It has a moist, soft feeling&lt;br /&gt;I noticed within a few short weeks.  People ask what skin care products I use,&lt;br /&gt;and I gladly share my secret. Thanks for a great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using phytoceramides since March and have seen a difference not only on my face but my entire body.  People can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 60 years old!  I don’t have many facial wrinkles but the ones I have aren’t as noticible (smile lines). I will continue to use phytoceramides and now have my sister using them!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Since I started taking Phytocramides, I have noticed my skin looks better-more hydrated.  I have been to two skin specialist open houses in the past month, the first place after a week on Phytocramides said my skin was still dry however the other was last Saturday, they had a special blue light machine and said my skin looked hydrated. My best friend asked what I have been doing and is ready to start taking them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said her skin wasn&#x27;t so dry anymore. It makes her fine lines look less noticeable.</li>
            <li> can feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin seems to be more moisturized than before. It does feel softer, firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Take once a day. No problem. Only had it a few days. Will update you again later.</li>
            <li> did not see any difference in skin at all maybe because i take vitamins anyway without fail</li>
            <li> While I have only been taking for 2 weeks now, I have noticed my skin just has a better overall feel and look to it. Taking a pill to help with hydration does seem silly, but I have to say I am liking what I see so far. I will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone wishing to enhance their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free -- Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> All BODIES HAVE DIFFERENT TIMING. Mine takes longer for all supplements. I have very dry skin . This product has noticeably softened my legs, arms and hands. No more patchy spots. Everyone has different body chemistry. This product works. It may take longer than 2 weeks or even a month. It took me 8 weeks to see a major improvement. It was worth the wait. I just bought 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to alleviate my dull and dry skin, I&#x27;m naturally brown skinned. I started using this product about a month ago, I could see the difference, my skin now noticeably smooth, glowy and lighter. one more thing I like about the product is, ONE PILL DAILY. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and also recommend it to family and friends</li>
            <li> Not really sure if they work or not. I only bought one month supply. In my opinion not a long enough time for me to determine.</li>
            <li> sorry but i didn&#x27;t find this did anything for me, and would not purchase again, but i gave it a try</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have used Premium-Fusion Phytoceramides now for 90 days and I will continue to use them every day because of the benefit that I feel in my body. The Amazon delivery was great and Amazon is the only place I trust .&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first if a supplement can really turn back the hands of time but this product really works. I had 3 people try this product out. I along with my parents tested this product out to see if the hype was reality. Here is what I observed through trying out Premium-Fusion Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me - I am in my mid thirtys and took the supplement. I am not one to use wrinkle creams or other products to look younger. I feel a lot of guys won&#x27;t use creams and cleansers like women do. I wash my face everyday but that is the max I do to take care of my skin. So I was very interested in a pill that can help with fine lines and wrinkles that are creeping up as I get older. The most significant improvement I saw in my skin was it felt smoother, less rough, and the wrinkles on the corner of my eyes diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom - She turn 62 and has been using every imaginable wrinkle cream, cleansers, herbal product to get better skin. She was very impressed with Premium-Fusion Phytoceramides as seen better results that any wrinkle cream she tried. She told me the bags under her eyes were less noticeable. She also felt her face felt softer and more plump. She was so impressed by Premium-Fusion Phytoceramides she wants to order another bottle asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad - My dad is over 70 and seen the most significant improvement. He has always look younger than his age but father time has started to show as he gets older. After just 2 weeks he seen improvement in fine lines and wrinkles on forehead, around eyes, and skin that is softer to the touch. He has had problem with rough and dry skin and Premium-Fusion Phytoceramides has greatly help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product really works and 3/3 of my family recommend it. Also Premium-Fusion version is 60 days, 1 tablet a day. Some of the other products you must take 2 tablets which increased the price of the product. The product is made in the USA, 100% natural, zero fillers or artificial ingredients and has addedvitamin A,C,D, and E.</li>
