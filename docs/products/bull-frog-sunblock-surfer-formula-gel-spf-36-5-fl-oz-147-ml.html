    <ol>
            <li>The Doc&#x27;s today can&#x27;t believe my skin is in this good of a condition!!</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, shipped in a timely manner, and exceeds all expectations...</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>After being discontinued,  the BEST PROTECTION in my opinion is returning.  </li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>It is excellent as it does not come off - even in very warm water.</li>
            <li>We tried this on a scuba diving trip to Belize and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>What a great product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, been using it for decades.  </li>
            <li>The Bull Frog Surfer Formula worked great.</li>
            <li>I guess this is a good feature for water sports, but it could be bothersome to some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could see how you would have a problem if you tried to put this on while on the beach as it&#x27;s a fairly  viscous liquid.  </li>
            <li>A surfer catching good waves is not going to come in to \\&quot;RE</li>
            <li>I have to order more!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and burn quickly.</li>
            <li>, so I carry it in its own Ziploc bag, but I carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li>We are weekend water people and this is the absolute best sunblock I have found.  </li>
            <li>Out in full sun today for over 6 hours and not a hint of burn, yet got good color, with one application.  </li>
            <li>I can enjoy myself more around the water now, because I don&#x27;t have to be the family sunscreen nazi!</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>to or better would be the \\&quot;CLOWN-WHITE\\&quot; zinc products where you can be seen from a mile away.   </li>
            <li>But waterproof so the pros outweigh the slimy con! :)</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been fooled into buying 70+</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure.  </li>
            <li>We are in and out of the boat and the water (ocean)constantly and NOTHING lasts longer and works better.  </li>
            <li>Many of them promise what this one does:  </li>
            <li>I knew I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Will be launching it in the original package in the spring of 2015!</li>
            <li>While this is SPF 36, it gives great protection from sunburn and allows a nice tan at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Also great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you use it properly, you&#x27;re good to go all day both in and out of the water!</li>
            <li>Its true - lake itch didn&#x27;t get me!  </li>
            <li>It may be fine for surfers, but not for golfers.  </li>
            <li>I was wading in water all day while fly fishing in shorts &amp; was the only one in a party of four who did not suffer at all from over-exposure to the sun.  </li>
            <li>Just confirmed with the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>My skin color is fairly light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great luck with Bullfrog gel sunscreen and ordered this \\&quot;surfer\\&quot; type because Amazon did not have the standard gel.  </li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t oily like the original.</li>
            <li>I used Bull Frog Surfer for the first time &amp; was totally satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>- True waterproof capability    </li>
            <li>Smells good, stays on and isnÂ´t white.</li>
            <li>Apply 20 minutes before sun exposure and you are good for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Once set in, sweat and water don&#x27;t seem to phase it, and I&#x27;m left gloriously unburned, which is impressive considering my red-hair and Irish ancestry.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens&#x27; marketting is what moves them off the shelf/availability at your normal stores/the irresistable fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It works absolutely great and really does protect you all day long.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does the job preventing sunburn but allowing a nice tan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been living in Hawai&#x27;i for about a year now, and was introduced to this brand when I first got here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sunscreens since I first knew of them--more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for a week of wading in shallow water, fly fishing.  </li>
            <li>Paid for fast shipping to make sure it came before big trip</li>
            <li>Although the oil-like consistency takes a little getting used to, I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>this was great to use while snorkling, but when we used it on the beach, it allows the sand the stick to any area you have applied it, and is very hard to get the sand off.</li>
            <li>Perhaps her face broke out because of her age, salt water, and too much contact with chlorine?  </li>
            <li>Thanks .......</li>
            <li>No complaints whatsoever - much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!    </li>
            <li>product expires 18+/- months from manufacture; my new bottle&#x3D; Nov. 2011)Dermatologist told me they break down &amp; aren&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
            <li>The original formula was like a second skin that protected you from sun, salt water, chlorine, windburn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early twenties, have very pale skin, and have already had a fair share of pre-cancerous moles removed since infancy.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant (as opposed to the highly pharmaceutical white stuff), it won&#x27;t leave awkward white streaks across your body, and it really does (if applied generously throughout the day) protect you from the sun, whilst allowing you to get a pleasant tan.</li>
            <li>Feels different going on, almost like a wax, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Had purchased Bull Frog Gel in the past and enjoyed the product.  </li>
            <li>It also applies evenly and left me feeling like I could use less for more coverage.</li>
            <li>If you apply it after you start sweating from the heat of the sun, it loses most of its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>It also seemed to cause my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s face to break out.</li>
            <li>By the third day, many of the other guests at our resort had at least mild sunburns.</li>
            <li>I initially thought that the price was too high for a 5oz bottle, then I realized I was paying almost $10 for 3oz of Neutrogena with helioplex.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re home from the trip now and her skin is completely back to normal.    </li>
            <li>Keeps my pale and pasty skin whiter than a full moon at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is so much nicer than most; it doesn&#x27;t sting or feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>We still use our Neutrogena when we are positive we aren&#x27;t going to get wet, because it feels lighter on the skin.</li>
            <li>Surf Gel formula will return with improved Broad Spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB ultra violet rays.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the old amphibious formula, this is all that&#x27;s left of it.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low to get some for a trip to Florida last month before finally ordering 2 bottles off of Amazon.  </li>
            <li>No other manufacturer that I have investigated makes the 8 hour claim; I believe the only thing close-</li>
            <li>In addition, the Bullfrog surfer formula lasts much longer, without re-applying, so we use substantially less per day.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It must last a long time, because the next day I still have trouble washing it off in the shower -- no matter how much soap I use.  </li>
            <li> If you want:     - Long lasting protection from sunburn   </li>
            <li> Bullfrog sure made a lot of unhappy loyalist when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Surfer Formula gel has the slippy texture that I expected, and the same orange-y scent.  </li>
            <li> We applied it in our room and it was dry before we got to the beach.</li>
            <li> has in the past under the old moniker.  </li>
            <li> I applied it once in the morning and spent 8 hours on the deck of a catamaran and snorkeling and not was even the slightest bit pink.</li>
            <li> cuz a little goes a long way &amp; stays until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Even all the other Bullfrog products recommend that.</li>
            <li> In the past, Bull Frog Amphibious was the only thing I could rely on to keep me from burning.    </li>
            <li> NO issues with sand, despite what other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to allow the gel to soak into your skin for at least 20 minutes before sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is slimy &amp; thick.  </li>
            <li> I typically get a sunburn on my head wherever we go if i&#x27;m not wearing a hat.  </li>
            <li> The gel is slightly greasy, so I wouldn&#x27;t roll around in the sand after applying.</li>
            <li> When I switched her to another brand, her face cleared a little.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT get heavy handed with this one</li>
            <li> This sunblock feels somewhat oily going on, but absorbs well after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Instead it dries down like a facial mask making your skin feel tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the gel contains beeswax as the second component on inactive ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> This left an uncomfortable waxy film on skin which was difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> However, I was proved wrong.</li>
            <li> you will be covered with sand and it is difficult to remove.    </li>
            <li> Too bad it is out of production now.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in BF Surfer Formula.  </li>
            <li> I also did not want to have to reapply over and over again, because I hate applying sunscreen.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> There are a lot of sunscreens out there- Which one won&#x27;t leave YOU out there; over-exposed &amp; skin/sub-derma damaged. Most sunscreens&#x27; marketting is what moves them off the shelf/availability at your normal stores/the irresistable fragrance.  BULLFROG SURFER FORMULA GEL (SPF 36) IS DIFFERENT. IT LASTS ***8 HOURS*** -SWEAT, SWIM, SALT, DIRT &amp; SOME RUBBING.(NOTE: product expires 18+/- months from manufacture; my new bottle&#x3D; Nov. 2011)Dermatologist told me they break down &amp; aren&#x27;t as effective.  A surfer catching good waves is not going to come in to \\&quot;RE-APPLY\\&quot;. Even all the other Bullfrog products recommend that. No other manufacturer that I have investigated makes the 8 hour claim; I believe the only thing close-to or better would be the \\&quot;CLOWN-WHITE\\&quot; zinc products where you can be seen from a mile away.   I am a land surveyor, having worked outside for over 35 years. The dermatologist from 20 years ago reccomended a \\&quot;Chemical\\&quot; sunscreen that chemically interacts with the skin- that one caused a red rash on me. A fellow surveyor recommended Bullfrog Surfer Formula, and I&#x27;ve been religiously using it since. Being 1000&#x27;s of feet away from the truck, I don&#x27;t want to have to \\&quot;re-apply\\&quot;. The Doc&#x27;s today can&#x27;t believe my skin is in this good of a condition!!</li>
            <li> If you want:     - Long lasting protection from sunburn   - True waterproof capability    Look no further - just get it.  It works.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to Jamaica.  It definitely does the job preventing sunburn but allowing a nice tan.  The only drawback is that it is slimy &amp; thick.  But waterproof so the pros outweigh the slimy con! :)</li>
            <li> I initially thought that the price was too high for a 5oz bottle, then I realized I was paying almost $10 for 3oz of Neutrogena with helioplex. In addition, the Bullfrog surfer formula lasts much longer, without re-applying, so we use substantially less per day. I can enjoy myself more around the water now, because I don&#x27;t have to be the family sunscreen nazi! We tried this on a scuba diving trip to Belize and it worked great. By the third day, many of the other guests at our resort had at least mild sunburns. We were applying once after breakfast, then hitting the water for 1 hour dives in the morning and afternoon, with snorkeling, kayaking and fishing during our surface intervals. Nobody in our family even got a hint of sunburn. We still use our Neutrogena when we are positive we aren&#x27;t going to get wet, because it feels lighter on the skin. But, if there are going to be any water activities, we reach for the surfer formula. We actually didn&#x27;t have any sand problems, but we never tried to apply it in the sand. We applied it in our room and it was dry before we got to the beach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living in Hawai&#x27;i for about a year now, and was introduced to this brand when I first got here. For many years I&#x27;ve been fooled into buying 70+ SPF sunscreen lotions which never truly worked. I&#x27;m in my early twenties, have very pale skin, and have already had a fair share of pre-cancerous moles removed since infancy. With that said, I was apprehensive when I got this, since I doubted a 36 SPF would do the trick. However, I was proved wrong. It is a bit sticky, meaning you get sand around its lid (and on you!), so I carry it in its own Ziploc bag, but I carry it everywhere. The smell is pleasant (as opposed to the highly pharmaceutical white stuff), it won&#x27;t leave awkward white streaks across your body, and it really does (if applied generously throughout the day) protect you from the sun, whilst allowing you to get a pleasant tan.</li>
            <li> I purchased this surfer gel just before heading to Florida for a vacation with the family.  Although the oil-like consistency takes a little getting used to, I absolutely love it!  I typically get a sunburn on my head wherever we go if i&#x27;m not wearing a hat.  Because this sunblock is nothing like the lotion based sunblocks, it allowed me to use it on my head without all the white clumpyness you would expect from traditional sunblock.  It works absolutely great and really does protect you all day long.  My only suggestion would be to allow the gel to soak into your skin for at least 20 minutes before sun exposure.  If you apply it after you start sweating from the heat of the sun, it loses most of its effectiveness.  If you use it properly, you&#x27;re good to go all day both in and out of the water!</li>
            <li> This used to be called Bull Frog Amphibious Formula.  I looked high and low to get some for a trip to Florida last month before finally ordering 2 bottles off of Amazon.  In the past, Bull Frog Amphibious was the only thing I could rely on to keep me from burning.    Surfer Formula gel has the slippy texture that I expected, and the same orange-y scent.  However, it did not protect me from the rays like it has in the past under the old moniker.  I applied it generously, but had to re-apply several times throughout the day.  It also seemed to cause my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s face to break out. When I switched her to another brand, her face cleared a little.  Perhaps her face broke out because of her age, salt water, and too much contact with chlorine?  I&#x27;m not 100% sure.  We&#x27;re home from the trip now and her skin is completely back to normal.    I was disappointed in BF Surfer Formula.  :/</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Smells good, stays on and isnÂ´t white. This the second time to buy this product and IÂ´ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a gel and not white cream.  It goes on well and doesn&#x27;t feel too tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must last a long time, because the next day I still have trouble washing it off in the shower -- no matter how much soap I use.  I guess this is a good feature for water sports, but it could be bothersome to some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WILL last if you are out in the water.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the old amphibious formula, this is all that&#x27;s left of it. The original formula was like a second skin that protected you from sun, salt water, chlorine, windburn. This stuff isn&#x27;t oily like the original. Instead it dries down like a facial mask making your skin feel tight and uncomfortable. I hope that Bull Frog takes note and brings  back the Amphibious formula. Until then, I&#x27;ll be using Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> While this is SPF 36, it gives great protection from sunburn and allows a nice tan at the same time.  Doesn&#x27;t come off in the water.  Great product!  I have to order more!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a week of wading in shallow water, fly fishing.  It is excellent as it does not come off - even in very warm water. No sunburn.</li>
            <li> this was great to use while snorkling, but when we used it on the beach, it allows the sand the stick to any area you have applied it, and is very hard to get the sand off. I would suggest use for water activities only.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, shipped in a timely manner, and exceeds all expectations... Thanks ....... I would buy from this merchant again. Over 5 hours in the sun and water... No re-application and no sunburn either....</li>
            <li> What a great product. Feels different going on, almost like a wax, but absorbs quickly.  We are weekend water people and this is the absolute best sunblock I have found.  We are in and out of the boat and the water (ocean)constantly and NOTHING lasts longer and works better.  Out in full sun today for over 6 hours and not a hint of burn, yet got good color, with one application.  NO issues with sand, despite what other reviewers have said.  I could see how you would have a problem if you tried to put this on while on the beach as it&#x27;s a fairly  viscous liquid.  Apply 20 minutes before sun exposure and you are good for the entire day.  Try it, you&#x27;ll never buy another sunblock.    Frederick  Myrtle Beach, SC</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sunscreens since I first knew of them--more than 30 years.  This is daily use, not occasional.  Many of them promise what this one does:  Doesn&#x27;t sweat off or rub off besides being waterproof.  Do NOT get heavy handed with this one cuz a little goes a long way &amp; stays until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, been using it for decades.  Too bad it is out of production now.  Rumor of its return in 2014?  Bullfrog sure made a lot of unhappy loyalist when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Keeps my pale and pasty skin whiter than a full moon at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only sunscreen that prevents me from burning.</li>
            <li> I used Bull Frog Surfer for the first time &amp; was totally satisfied with the results.  No complaints whatsoever - much better than expected.  I was wading in water all day while fly fishing in shorts &amp; was the only one in a party of four who did not suffer at all from over-exposure to the sun.  Highly recommended!    P.S. - I was, also, the only one using BF Sunblock - ;&gt;)</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried. From the moment I put it on I knew I&#x27;d love it. The texture is so much nicer than most; it doesn&#x27;t sting or feel uncomfortable at all. It also applies evenly and left me feeling like I could use less for more coverage. Once set in, sweat and water don&#x27;t seem to phase it, and I&#x27;m left gloriously unburned, which is impressive considering my red-hair and Irish ancestry.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and burn quickly. We were going to Hawaii for 2 weeks and I was looking for something that I could use while snorkeling and not burn my back and legs. I also did not want to have to reapply over and over again, because I hate applying sunscreen. The Bull Frog Surfer Formula worked great. I applied it once in the morning and spent 8 hours on the deck of a catamaran and snorkeling and not was even the slightest bit pink. This sunblock feels somewhat oily going on, but absorbs well after a few minutes. There is no white film to have to keep trying to rub in. This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Had purchased Bull Frog Gel in the past and enjoyed the product.  This product seemed to be what we wanted, gel plus SPF of about 30.  Unfortunately, the gel contains beeswax as the second component on inactive ingredients list.  This left an uncomfortable waxy film on skin which was difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Terrific News!!!  After being discontinued,  the BEST PROTECTION in my opinion is returning.  Just confirmed with the manufacturer.  Surf Gel formula will return with improved Broad Spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB ultra violet rays.  Will be launching it in the original package in the spring of 2015!</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that you could put this on, jump in the lake and the lake itch wouldn&#x27;t touch you.  Its true - lake itch didn&#x27;t get me!  But I slipped and slid all over the place as well as got greasy finger prints on everything!  I used it... but lost my floaty and fell off the boat!</li>
            <li> Worked as described. Paid for fast shipping to make sure it came before big trip and it did.  Reviews helped select product and it works as described.  No burning on tush while on nude beach. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bullfrog products for years and the Surfer Formula Gel does not disappoint. The gel is slightly greasy, so I wouldn&#x27;t roll around in the sand after applying. My skin color is fairly light so the SPF 36 lets just enough sun through to get tan without getting burned. My family uses this product while boating on a lake. Even after being sweaty and in and out of the water all day we are not burned and seldom need to reapply Bullfrog.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunblock. I have very fair, sensitive skin and I worked at a camp last summer teaching sailing and lifeguarding all day, five days a weeks. I wore this and applied every two hours and I didn&#x27;t even get a hint of sunburn. I definitely recommend this for anyone who will be around water in the summer time. Also great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with Bullfrog gel sunscreen and ordered this \\&quot;surfer\\&quot; type because Amazon did not have the standard gel.  It may be fine for surfers, but not for golfers.  If you hit out of a sand trap and the wind blows the sand on you, it will stick to this sunscreen - you will be covered with sand and it is difficult to remove.    Golfers - stick to the standard gel.</li>
