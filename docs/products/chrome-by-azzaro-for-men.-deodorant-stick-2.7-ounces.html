            <li>THat&#x27;s good, but I would rather feel more &#x27;scented&#x27; if I am going to spend $10 on</li>

            <li>GIRLS LOVE CHROME.</li>
            <li>I love Chrome.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 10 years because it is mild but effective.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say everyone will love it but from my opinion it is a clean and not over-powering smell that is not reactive to my skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong this time.</li>
            <li>I will just say one important fact from my Exp.</li>

            <li>This makes me smell purdy, it really does!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really think of anything else to say about it right now.</li>
            <li>The fact that other people would comment on it in the office and in social gatherings is a pretty good indicator that it is a winner.</li>
            <li>maybe I got jipped and never got the real thing</li>
            <li>There is a hint of similarity but the smell is much much stronger.</li>

            <li>I am usually very sensitive with deodorant and only use certain over the counter brands.</li>
            <li>I did, I bought it there only to discover that it  was much cheaper in the USA at Sams Club when I returned home.</li>
            <li>My wife is picky and always complained about the smell of my deodorants being too strong or musky.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s shipped directly to my door.--Much less expensive and much more convenient!</li>

            <li> I use it after showering in the morning and maybe another time if I am going out again after heading home since the smell does not last too long for me.  </li>

            <li> Loses one star for not lasting all day.  </li>

            <li> I found it just average.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few she likes</li>
            <li> This deodorant stick will probably last you about 3 to 4 months with casual use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;Bring down the price</li>

            <li> I love this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;Bring down the price and I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars anytime.</li>

            <li> I am usually very sensitive with deodorant and only use certain over the counter brands. My wife is picky and always complained about the smell of my deodorants being too strong or musky. This is one of the few she likes and I use with the spray cologne too. I have gotten complements from the women in the office as well that the like the sent. I can&#x27;t say everyone will love it but from my opinion it is a clean and not over-powering smell that is not reactive to my skin.

            <li> I will just say one important fact from my Exp. GIRLS LOVE CHROME. Hurry up and By this Item, because you will not find it in stores, and if you do it will not be the same price.  Deodorant in stores are jocks comparing to Mr Azzaro. I got this and My girl always wants my arm around her.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing.  Smells good, refreshing and best part, value for price is perfect for a designer brand too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it. THat&#x27;s good, but I would rather feel more &#x27;scented&#x27; if I am going to spend $10 on it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I like the &#x27;onyx&#x27; line of Azzaro products. This is definitley a lighter/airier scent, and doesn&#x27;t help my grownup smell much.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this has alcohol, so I may have to use it a while to get to the juicy part of the stick. I am going back to the Onyx flavor. That one I prefer- it has no alcohol, and much stronger scent on me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years because it is mild but effective.  I recommend it to anyone who has allergies to other over the counter deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now. The smell is too strong this time. The outside material looks cheap. However, it&#x27;s a good product overall. It&#x27;s completely different than cheaper products like those can be bought in target, ...</li>
            <li> Husband loved this. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Nothing else to add; simply elegant! Have been using it for almost 13 years and it does not get old!</li>
            <li> I found it just average.  I can take it or leave it.  It is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Clarence</li>
            <li> This makes me smell purdy, it really does! I can&#x27;t really think of anything else to say about it right now.</li>
            <li> I paid too much for nothing!!! There is no flagrance in this thing at all!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product...I bought it for my son.  He is using it everyday and even his girlfriend commented on how great it smells. It was sent promptly.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I frequently buy this item, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Chrome. I discovered it when I was in France. My Brother-In-Law was wearing it and I really liked it. He suggested I buy it at the border between France and Spain. I did, I bought it there only to discover that it  was much cheaper in the USA at Sams Club when I returned home. I still buy it though via Amazon and it&#x27;s shipped directly to my door.--Much less expensive and much more convenient! I like it! You may like it too!</li>
            <li> $20 for deodorant?... tongue my balloon knot</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for my boy friend BUT it did not come with a box.</li>
