            <li>Smells great, super moisturizing mood setter!  </li>
            <li>The heated oil makes for a great massage and has been a huge hit at home.</li>
            <li>smells amazing</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really liked it.</li>
            <li>It smelled quite nice, without being too overbearing or perfumey.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by another friend who liked it.</li>
            <li>Warm it up, let the liquid melt, blow out the candle, then go for what you know.</li>
            <li>It smells great on the body, so have fun with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, great value and terrific service.</li>
            <li>This massage candle has a very pleasant yet not overpowering scent, and it is rightfully its primary positive</li>
            <li>This candle smells fantastic and feels amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this candle and scent over and over and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Was thinking of scooping it into a microwave safe container and microwaving it to a liquid to use it?</li>
            <li>everyone loves candles that smell good and having the massage oil as a plus is such a great idea</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this candle.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic and totally natural- awesome!</li>
            <li>but once it got going, the smell and the warm oil were fantastic.</li>
            <li>You will love the response you get from your partner when you start rubbing this on them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, there is a problem with the shape of the jar itself, which has a lip at the top to seal the lid which makes pouring the melted candle oil difficult/messy.</li>
            <li>Seems like the candle has had many uses, with many more to go.</li>
            <li>The scent is good and the oil doesn&#x27;t pour out so hot that you can&#x27;t drip it on...</li>
            <li>I love to light it and let it set a while on my bedroom nightstand.</li>
            <li>It was a really good deal considering the high quality of the candle.</li>
            <li>They are just a cute, cool gift idea...</li>
            <li>Awesome little candle.</li>
            <li>Aromatherapy and massage oil make this candle great for baths or a back rub.</li>
            <li>the only problem is the spoon they give u is not that great</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is not a candle you just want to sit on your dresser or mantle, then light for the throw and scent.</li>
            <li>and then you can pour it right on the body for a warm, but not uncomfortable oil!</li>
            <li>It helps to smooth your skin i use it once in two weeks with moisturizing gloves cause its pretty rich!</li>
            <li>It burns steadily and smells like sweet cotton candy, and when the wax is warm it can be used as a body oil.  </li>
            <li>I purchased several of these to add to gifts for my 6 nieces (all college level and newly beyond), they loved them!</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend you getting it :)</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>It really helps smooth calluses if you use every night.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a good price for the product though when compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it many times, from full body massages to area specific uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hot when you first pour it either.</li>
            <li>I will likely stick with the traditional liquid massage oils as I have yet to find an exceptional candle with smell and texture.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try if you are curious and maybe you will like it more than me.</li>
            <li>Not a great moisturizer like it implies (too sticky to leave on), but great for massages.</li>
            <li>Lit this in my room and could still smell the light scent a week later!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for couples who enjoy the occasionally sensual messages.</li>
            <li>little spoon doesn&#x27;t seem terribly useful, I was somewhat surprised and pleased that the oil is not too hot and can be trickled directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>The candle smell is ok and the liquid texture is average.  </li>
            <li>someone other than yourself! :)</li>
            <li>The oil does make a mess, it&#x27;s hard to pour out effectively, so make sure you&#x27;re not using it over anything that it can stain/damage.</li>
            <li>I liked the massage part of it, but the candle burned down in the center and there is a lot left on the sides but no candle wick to light.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Melts the oil easily and comes with a little spoon.</li>
            <li>The spoon they include seems impractical in my opinion, as far as scooping melted oil goes.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price will be looking for other scents.</li>
            <li>Feels slightly oily at first but goes away in time.</li>

            <li> This is a great candle and massage oil. The heated oil makes for a great massage and has been a huge hit at home.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible or great. Not sure I&#x27;ll ever use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Earthly Body candles before. I love to light it and let it set a while on my bedroom nightstand. It makes the room smell wonderful. Then when i blow it out, I use the little spoon to scoop up some melted oil and rub on my skin. Its not like regular candle wax, its like body oil. It really helps smooth calluses if you use every night.</li>
            <li> best massage oil I ever uesd! Not upset with this purchase at all! So worth it. It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Smells great, super moisturizing mood setter!  The candle smells good while burning and then you can pour it right on the body for a warm, but not uncomfortable oil!</li>
            <li> This candle smells fantastic and feels amazing on the skin. It was a really good deal considering the high quality of the candle.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really liked it. The product is good for massaging, good for the skin, easy to apply and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> This product is well made.  It smells nice and the oil works great. I thought the candle was small when I first got it but it lasts a long time.  A little bit of the massage oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The scent is good and the oil doesn&#x27;t pour out so hot that you can&#x27;t drip it on...someone other than yourself! :)</li>
            <li> This candle has a great smell and feel. I saw the same one at a local spa for almost 4 times the price. Def a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for massaging my wife.  The candle smell is ok and the liquid texture is average.  I will likely stick with the traditional liquid massage oils as I have yet to find an exceptional candle with smell and texture.  It is a good price for the product though when compared to other brands.  Give it a try if you are curious and maybe you will like it more than me.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and the wax is a perfect oil. It&#x27;s not too hot when you first pour it either. My boyfriend and I love it. We use this at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> This soy candle has a very light wonderful smell when it is burning.  You can also use it as a moisturizer. I have purchased this candle and scent over and over and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>

            <li> Awesome Candle - Smells so Good and the massage oil is a great addition. I purchased several of these to add to gifts for my 6 nieces (all college level and newly beyond), they loved them! They are just a cute, cool gift idea...everyone loves candles that smell good and having the massage oil as a plus is such a great idea (wish I would have thought of these). Great product, great value and terrific service. I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Love this oil candle! Aromatherapy and massage oil make this candle great for baths or a back rub. Not a great moisturizer like it implies (too sticky to leave on), but great for massages.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, so I haven&#x27;t actually used it. It smelled quite nice, without being too overbearing or perfumey. It was recommended by another friend who liked it. I would probably buy this one again for myself if I wanted one.</li>
            <li> Everything in the reviews is correct. Works great but definitely gummy at the end of a massage. We wipe it off after.</li>
            <li> smells amazing i love it the only problem is the spoon they give u is not that great id suggest getting your own, but the product itself is amazing i love it and am very happy with it and i highly recommend you getting it :)</li>
            <li> I saw these in a store and thought I would order one online.  The candle does smell good and once its lit you can use the oil but it takes a long time to rub in.  I&#x27;m happy but I would try another brand before buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this candle.  Feels and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a little sticky when compared to a standard massage oil, but it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The little spoon doesn&#x27;t seem terribly useful, I was somewhat surprised and pleased that the oil is not too hot and can be trickled directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this candle!  It burns steadily and smells like sweet cotton candy, and when the wax is warm it can be used as a body oil.  Fantastic and totally natural- awesome!</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first but once it got going, the smell and the warm oil were fantastic. You will love the response you get from your partner when you start rubbing this on them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this candle last weekend and got it on time. This candle smells wonderful! Melts the oil easily and comes with a little spoon. Definitely a good product to buy.</li>
            <li> This massage candle has a very pleasant yet not overpowering scent, and it is rightfully its primary positive characteristic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief complaint I have about the Earthly Body 3-in-1 Suntouched Skinny Dip 6 oz. Body Massage Candle is the slight stickiness of the candle oil/wax. I usually find myself having to apply it along with some other massage oil in order to use it effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is a problem with the shape of the jar itself, which has a lip at the top to seal the lid which makes pouring the melted candle oil difficult/messy. The spoon they include seems impractical in my opinion, as far as scooping melted oil goes. If the shape of the tin/jar was improved, I would rate it 4-out-of-5.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it many times, from full body massages to area specific uses. It&#x27;s been great. She even uses it as lotion for her hands. Feels slightly oily at first but goes away in time. Seems like the candle has had many uses, with many more to go. Awesome little candle.</li>
            <li> This candle smells excellent when lit, and the oil doesn&#x27;t get too hot. The oil does make a mess, it&#x27;s hard to pour out effectively, so make sure you&#x27;re not using it over anything that it can stain/damage. Lit this in my room and could still smell the light scent a week later!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for couples who enjoy the occasionally sensual messages. Warm it up, let the liquid melt, blow out the candle, then go for what you know. The spoon is unnecessary, though. In my opinion, this is not a candle you just want to sit on your dresser or mantle, then light for the throw and scent. It smells great on the body, so have fun with it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product it is as good as it is described. It is worth the price will be looking for other scents.</li>
