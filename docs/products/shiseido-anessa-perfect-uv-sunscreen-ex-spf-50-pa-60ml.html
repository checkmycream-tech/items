            <li>still love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this ever since.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen with high protection, no white-cast, and no piling underneath make-up.  </li>
            <li>Very sweet!</li>
            <li>but this is cheaper and more effective.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is very liquidy, but it goes on beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Very light sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It took more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sure will order this product again but may not from this seller.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Have purchased two more bottles as I cannot run out of supply.</li>
            <li>However, I have used Shieseido Anessa Sunscreen before and love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>So pleased with this product, I just came on amazon to order more so that I never run out.  </li>
            <li>The seller is also very sweet and neatly wrote a handwritten thank you note.</li>
            <li>How sweet!</li>
            <li>I bought this item originally just because it has one more + in blocking UV capability.</li>
            <li>However, it is fantastic and I will keep buying it and wearing it on days when I will be out gardening, etc.  </li>
            <li>Not oily, aroma is light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give that oily residue on the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things from this sunscreen and wanted to see if it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is pretty phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li>This Shiseido sunscreen is super light</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would go on cleanly and be matte under makeup.  </li>
            <li>so I notice how drying it is but with the humidity and heat of this summer , it&#x27;s been very nice to have something this light on my skin that offers this high protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it more if they made a larger size.</li>
            <li>I got super paranoid after reading your comment and did a ton of research after receiving my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the new one.i love it</li>
            <li>It no longer has the strong sunblock smell and it&#x27;s now much lighter and not oily anymore</li>
            <li>Okay to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled for the second summer with this product.</li>
            <li>The old version already did a great job in preventing tanning and long-lasting (only apply twice</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a chore to remove but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Took a couple weeks to arrive and was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I searched and searched for a brand that had high SPF and was comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Plus or the other facial Sunscreen sold at Department stores and Sephora and as good as or even better quality.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have the plastic cover that indicates it&#x27;s new or genuine.</li>
            <li>After I receive it, I am amused that there is huge improvement for the new version.</li>
            <li>Seller is very prompt in processing the order, and nice enough to send a hand written thank</li>
            <li>Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint, not too oily, and stays longer.</li>
            <li>Started using this UV protection for some time and like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>Most regular-over-the-counter-drugstore skin product here is the same quality you&#x27;d find at a high end department store in th US.</li>
            <li>I just layer this on top of Skinseuticals vitamin C product or another skin serum in the morning if My skin feels too dry.</li>
            <li>I got more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It took a while to reach me but globalwide had been very responsive and helpful during the process.</li>
            <li>the sunscreen is very Liquid .</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on this product.  </li>
            <li>It really  really like Anessa.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is light and silky and does not leave white residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Anessa comes is a super cute small bottle and</li>
            <li>This product works well specially in sunny day, but people with combination skin type may find it not hydrated enough in winter.</li>
            <li>This type of protection is extremely hard to find and when you do, it is rare that you get it in a product that is so cosmetically elegant.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s the older cheaper version..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed getting any particular suntan in face throughout a year.  </li>
            <li>I have been using shiseido sunscreens for a few years and love them so much.</li>
            <li>To the person who said that she wasn&#x27;t sure if USA standard of SPF is equal to Japan&#x27;s standard, I had to laugh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone who does not want to get a tanned face in the summer:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle a little more than a month ago from Nippon-Store out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>+, since it&#x27;s a new rating.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a week now, and so far I like it a lot!</li>
            <li>It was such a better deal to order this online than buying the Shiseido Urban Environment version at Sephora, which is about the same price for less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New one has the word of  &amp;#34;new &amp;#34;; old one doesn&#x27;t has.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that I do not know what the standards for making SPF ratings are in Japan, so I cannot be certain that it would be equivalent to an SPF 50 for a brand here in the US.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for my sunscreen to be delivered as it was shipped directly from Japan.</li>
            <li>what comes out is a very watery milk that absorbs almost instantly into your skin.</li>
            <li>I also really like the Biore UV P+++ in the blue bottle</li>
            <li>No problem around sensitive eyes either - some sunblock lotion irritates but not Anessa.  </li>
            <li>It took nearly a month for the package shipped to the U.S.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be helping my acne, which is a major benefit for someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The new version eliminate the only downsides of  old version: smell and texture.</li>
            <li>White liquid, not thick at all.  </li>
            <li>They ship the old edition to me which is different and cheaper with the picture.</li>
            <li>It dries for a matte finish almost instantly but it may be too drying for those with dry skin or perhaps even normal.</li>

            <li> For me, it is a little bit dry, but not too much.</li>
            <li> For the old version, I only applied to my face for demanding situation and use another less oily sunblock for face.</li>
            <li> The new version is now even less oily than the one I used to put on my face!</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and smoothness of the UV lotion and less expensive than Clarins UV</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen daily (Hawaii) and you will never get dark even though go to the beach or hiking (used it each 2-3 hours)</li>
            <li> I do have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have used the old version(PA+++, 1&amp;#34;+&amp;#34; less) for a few years.</li>
            <li> be careful, guys.</li>
            <li> I wear only this Sunscreen and translucent powder, and walk about an hour almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I searched around and read some reviews on other sites and this was mentioned.</li>
            <li> This does not burn my eyes and I cannot say that about almost every other drug store sunscreen sold in the US.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely water proof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Japan but already can tell that Japan has INSANE high standard on skincare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and milky, isn&#x27;t drying, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> It smells fruity, not at all like your usual Banana Boat or Coppertone.</li>
            <li> , I can apply to my face even for ordinary sunlight situation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot wear it every single day without getting dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product is so hard to find in stores, so I purchased it online</li>
            <li> and I seldom got tanned or at least not noticeable for all-day-long outdoor activities).</li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any issue with the product but the shipping is way too SLOW!</li>
            <li> I bought it at a lower price,AND the seller gave me a small gift!!!</li>
            <li> l&#x27;applique tous les matins et c&#x27;est un plaisir, c&#x27;est une excellente base de maquillage car mon visage est hyper doux après l&#x27;avoir utilisé.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using this sunscreen for years. It is lightweight, not greasy and protected my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any issue with the product but the shipping is way too SLOW! It took more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sure will order this product again but may not from this seller.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the new one.i love it</li>
            <li> good, I like the cake</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the plastic cover that indicates it&#x27;s new or genuine.</li>
            <li> I got more than I expected. There is an extra 15ml sample coming with it and a piece of Candy! How sweet!</li>
            <li> Recommend it! I used this sunscreen daily (Hawaii) and you will never get dark even though go to the beach or hiking (used it each 2-3 hours) This is my favorite sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> Okay to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To the person who said that she wasn&#x27;t sure if USA standard of SPF is equal to Japan&#x27;s standard, I had to laugh. The Japanese women here are sooooooo goal oriented on having perfectly white skin (the beauty standards here are so different than back in the US). This Shiseido sunscreen is super light and it actually improves my skin&#x27;s texture. I highly recommend this to everyone who does not want to get a tanned face in the summer:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I&#x27;m new to Japan but already can tell that Japan has INSANE high standard on skincare. Most regular-over-the-counter-drugstore skin product here is the same quality you&#x27;d find at a high end department store in th US.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. It does not feel greasy after you apply it, and it repels water. It smells fruity, not at all like your usual Banana Boat or Coppertone.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this sunscreen. I used to use Shiseido spf 50 pa+++ waterproof and sweatproof and suddenly the formula and packaging had changed, it was no longer spf 50 pa+++, I don&#x27;t think it was waterproof and sweatproof anymore either. I searched around and read some reviews on other sites and this was mentioned. I ordered this last summer after my search and I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this ever since. I&#x27;d love it more if they made a larger size. The quality is definitely Shiseido, It goes on matte and lasts almost all day. I like to reapply while I am out. My husband calls this our industrial strength sunscreen. I am very fair and I do not get burned using this sunscreen which is a very good thing. I use this almost every day and I do not break out doing so. I do use Shiseido&#x27;s facial cleansing oil to remove the sunscreen on my face. I&#x27;m thrilled for the second summer with this product. I will continue to buy and use this sunscreen. It&#x27;s still the best!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen from an awesome seller! This is my second bottle, and I plan to be a regular buyer. Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint, not too oily, and stays longer. It took about 3 weeks for my sunscreen to be delivered as it was shipped directly from Japan. Seller is very prompt in processing the order, and nice enough to send a hand written thank you letter with a Japanese candy. Very sweet!</li>
            <li> be careful, guys. there are two different editions: New one has the word of  &amp;#34;new &amp;#34;; old one doesn&#x27;t has. They ship the old edition to me which is different and cheaper with the picture.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to find in stores, so I purchased it online and it was what I wanted. It took a while to reach me but globalwide had been very responsive and helpful during the process. Thanks very much.</li>
            <li> I have used the old version(PA+++, 1&amp;#34;+&amp;#34; less) for a few years. I bought this item originally just because it has one more + in blocking UV capability. After I receive it, I am amused that there is huge improvement for the new version. The old version already did a great job in preventing tanning and long-lasting (only apply twice and I seldom got tanned or at least not noticeable for all-day-long outdoor activities). The new version eliminate the only downsides of  old version: smell and texture. It no longer has the strong sunblock smell and it&#x27;s now much lighter and not oily anymore, I can apply to my face even for ordinary sunlight situation. For the old version, I only applied to my face for demanding situation and use another less oily sunblock for face. The new version is now even less oily than the one I used to put on my face! Great job, Shiseido!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a week now, and so far I like it a lot! It&#x27;s thin and milky, isn&#x27;t drying, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. I actually don&#x27;t wear BB Cream or foundation, and just applying this sunscreen is enough to even my skin tone out. It was such a better deal to order this online than buying the Shiseido Urban Environment version at Sephora, which is about the same price for less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to the person who stated that if &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t on the packaging then it&#x27;s the older cheaper version.. I got super paranoid after reading your comment and did a ton of research after receiving my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Only the 2014 version has the PA rating of ++++, since it&#x27;s a new rating. So you can rest assured that you did indeed receive the 2014 version if the sunscreen you received has that rating.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is absolutely wonderful protection.  Unfortunately I cannot wear it every single day without getting dryness.  However, it is fantastic and I will keep buying it and wearing it on days when I will be out gardening, etc.  This type of protection is extremely hard to find and when you do, it is rare that you get it in a product that is so cosmetically elegant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice! Not oily, aroma is light.  Sunscreen is effective!</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and I do not tend my face anymore so I was looking for a sunscreen that works great and you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing grease on your face. Skinceuticals, Shishiedo blue tube 50spf, Tizo , those are all my go to sunscreens before I tried Japanese sunscreens. Anessa comes is a super cute small bottle and the sunscreen is very Liquid .( Very similar to Shishiedo&#x27;s sunscreen sold in the US that comes in a blue shaker bottle for body... This is much better!!) Anesso must be shaken to make noise before you can use it, this way all the ingredients are mixed up and what comes out is a very watery milk that absorbs almost instantly into your skin. I do have very dry skin so I notice how drying it is but with the humidity and heat of this summer , it&#x27;s been very nice to have something this light on my skin that offers this high protection. I just layer this on top of Skinseuticals vitamin C product or another skin serum in the morning if My skin feels too dry. This does not burn my eyes and I cannot say that about almost every other drug store sunscreen sold in the US. I also really like the Biore UV P+++ in the blue bottle , it isn&#x27;t quite as drying as this one but is is only a P+++</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle a little more than a month ago from Nippon-Store out of curiosity. I&#x27;ve heard great things from this sunscreen and wanted to see if it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time. I&#x27;ve confirmed it&#x27;s the holy grail of sunscreen!! At least for me. I have oily skin and this sunscreen is just perfect. It dries for a matte finish almost instantly but it may be too drying for those with dry skin or perhaps even normal. There is no greasy feeling or any feeling that I&#x27;m wearing any sunscreen at all! It&#x27;s extremely water proof so it&#x27;s a chore to remove but totally worth it. Have purchased two more bottles as I cannot run out of supply. I need this!</li>
            <li> This product works well specially in sunny day, but people with combination skin type may find it not hydrated enough in winter.</li>
            <li> Cette crème solaire est incroyable !!!! J&#x27;ai de plus en plus envie d&#x27;acheter des produits de soin pour la peau japonais, ils ont tout compris en ce qui concerne nos attentes concernant les soins. J&#x27;ai la peau mixte acnéique et je cherchais une crème solaire avec un indice 50 tout en étant sans matière, pas gras, en ne laissant pas la tête toute blanche et qui ne roule pas sur la peau.&lt;br /&gt;La matière de la Anessa est très fluide comme du lait, elle s&#x27;applique comme une huile (n&#x27;ayez pas peur) mais finit sur un fini semi-matte un peu velours mais pas du tout gras, car l&#x27;effet velours peut parfois être un peu glissant mais pas la Anessa. Je l&#x27;applique tous les matins et c&#x27;est un plaisir, c&#x27;est une excellente base de maquillage car mon visage est hyper doux après l&#x27;avoir utilisé.&lt;br /&gt;Je recommande mille fois cette crème solaire et je vais me penché de plus près sur les produits de soins japonais qui marchent VRAIMENT !</li>
            <li> Started using this UV protection for some time and like this product very much.  White liquid, not thick at all.  No problem around sensitive eyes either - some sunblock lotion irritates but not Anessa.  I wear only this Sunscreen and translucent powder, and walk about an hour almost everyday.  I haven&#x27;t noticed getting any particular suntan in face throughout a year.  60ml bottle lasts quite a bit, too.  I will keep using this one!</li>
            <li> Very light sunscreen. Very suitable for oily skin. For me, it is a little bit dry, but not too much. still love it!</li>
            <li> This purchase was a gift so I can&#x27;t really comment on this product.  However, I have used Shieseido Anessa Sunscreen before and love this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give that oily residue on the face.</li>
            <li> I have been using shiseido sunscreens for a few years and love them so much. My go to was always Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector. But this has hit my number one go to sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It really  really like Anessa.  I bought it at a lower price,AND the seller gave me a small gift!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is pretty phenomenal.  I was looking for something that would go on cleanly and be matte under makeup.  This definitely fits the bill.  The consistency is very liquidy, but it goes on beautifully.  It also seems to be helping my acne, which is a major benefit for someone with sensitive skin.  So pleased with this product, I just came on amazon to order more so that I never run out.  Took a couple weeks to arrive and was worth the wait. Came with a bonus travel-size.</li>
            <li> It took nearly a month for the package shipped to the U.S. I just tried it once and like the texture. Hopefully it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sunscreen! I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting tan while I stay outside in summer.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped next day and arrived within 10 days. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen on my face every day.  I searched and searched for a brand that had high SPF and was comfortable to wear.  This is light and silky and does not leave white residue on my skin.  My only concern is that I do not know what the standards for making SPF ratings are in Japan, so I cannot be certain that it would be equivalent to an SPF 50 for a brand here in the US.</li>
            <li> Great. Love the consistency and smoothness of the UV lotion and less expensive than Clarins UV Plus or the other facial Sunscreen sold at Department stores and Sephora and as good as or even better quality. Must buy for the future!</li>
            <li> Perfect shipping and condition!No word is needed</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen with high protection, no white-cast, and no piling underneath make-up.  I was using the American 30ml version with whitening but this is cheaper and more effective.  The seller is also very sweet and neatly wrote a handwritten thank you note.</li>
