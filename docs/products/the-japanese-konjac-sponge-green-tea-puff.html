            <li>You can use your favorite cleanser with it or use it alone.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of gently exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a rougher cut than others I&#x27;ve tried and it is more exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>and I disclose this always, because I value my reviews and most important my readers.</li>

            <li>- I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>You can even add your favorite cleanser for a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>This has really helped keep it in great shape and prevents it from growing mold or mildew in this hot Florida climate.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read over the details of each one, because it appears that some are better suited for certain skin</li>
            <li>they remove dirt and excess oil from my skin - this one being great for oily or combination skin - of which I have the latter.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy reviewing products</li>

            <li>I really enjoy reviewing products</li>
            <li>The oily skin is mostly up around the lower part of my forehead and there&#x27;s so much that sometimes I find a glob sitting on the top of my glasses frames.</li>
            <li>I always read user reviews when I am making purchases, and most times they lead me in the right direction.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had my fair share of brands and types but this Japanese Konjac Sponge is by far my most favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found American made ones to be too soft with a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li>to clean and reuse.</li>
            <li>You can use it on it’s own or with your favorite facial cleanser (which is what I do!).  </li>
            <li>The company recommends replacing the sponge every 4 to 6 weeks, but since it has a porous texture, I take additional measures to keep it clean while using it.</li>
            <li>(Definitely the main reason I love using it, thank you for allowing me to have the product in exchange for an honest review!)  </li>
            <li>For most of my life, I never had to deal with much when it came to my face.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice, texture was fine, it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin, and left her face feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It softens quickly with water, and dries out&lt;br /&gt;totally</li>
            <li>I think that this Japanese Konjac Sponge would be perfect for all skin types to help with facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li>The Japanese Konjac Sponge is still gentle, but more effective.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I use less cleanser when I do use any because I feel like the sponge itself does a great job at cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This felt good initially but fell apart pretty rapidly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect and long lasting</li>
            <li>I love this konjac sponge for my sensitive skin because it is not too abrasive and rubs away makeup like a dream!</li>
            <li>Japanese Konjac Sponge was very easy for us to use, gentle on our skin (even for people with sensitive skin) and at only $11.00, a great gift for yourself or a friend!</li>
            <li>I can also tell that my face has a nice, healthy glow and maintains the soft and smooth feeling for a long time after cleansing with this sponge.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to hang it as far away from where water can get to it when not in use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>While the Konjac Sponge has become popular in the USA in recent years, it has been used overseas in Japan, China and South Korea for over 100 years as a way to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li>I wanna get right to it, but I have to soak</li>
            <li>I love that it is Green Tea scented, but the smell is not at all overwhelming –</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few Konjac Sponges from drugstore to high end, and this brand is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>konjac sponge seems to be thicker, larger and a much better quality than what I have used before.</li>
            <li>I use it both with my favorite facial cleanser, or alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it sure enough did.</li>
            <li>I use this puff twice a day with a creamy cleanser (Komenuka Bijin) and it not only makes my cleanser work better but also helps maintain the smoothness and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>DOES ITS JOB VERY WELL!</li>
            <li>If I’m using cleanser, I apply it directly to the sponge and start to work it in a light circular motion on my face.</li>
            <li>: pre-soaking (just takes more time for my facial routine -</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate firming action from this konjac sponge but it did make my skin feel extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>: easy to use, all natural, really works&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>green tea formula means it’s suitable for oily and combination skin like mine, and with the gentle exfoliation, my skin looks fresh and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>They are my absolute faves when it comes to cleaning my skin, because the added ingredients help to heal, moisturize and hydrate, and I can use them with or without a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the sponge really helps to control my breakouts as well.  </li>
            <li>I really like using a foaming cleanser, but you can use any cleanser you like.</li>
            <li>You really need to be gentle with the sponge in order to keep it from tearing.  </li>
            <li>For example to not twist gently squeeze.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend removing makeup prior to using this with your cleanser however, and make sure to pay attention to the instructions and gently press your hands together to remove excess cleanser and water from the sponge, otherwise it will tear as it is made with completely natural fibers.</li>
            <li>Once it’s soaked, it expands much larger than the original size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my face feels after using it and the actual sponge itself isn&#x27;t rough at all once it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they also offer Cherry Blossom, Wild Mint, Citrus Fruit, and the popular Natural White, and I can’t wait to try the citrus fruit and wild mint sponges which they also offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also love that they offer different variations of the product for each individual</li>
            <li>Overall, I have enjoyed using The Japanese Konjac Sponge as it does wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Normal exfoliant sponge.  </li>
            <li>I really love this  Green Tea Konjac</li>
            <li>Daily stimulation of the skin cells is a very important part of maintaining the health and vibrancy of your skin, and that is exactly what this little tool is for.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday with a dot of all-natural facial cleanser and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>You don’t want it to be able to get wet all the time if you aren&#x27;t using it (such as when others are taking a shower/bath) since it will fall apart faster.</li>
            <li>sponge cleans up easy after use by simply rinsing and pressing the excess water and cleanser from the sponge, being careful not to twist or wring the sponge, which can damage the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply remove from packaging (sponge will be rough and dense, similar to floral foam) and run under warm water for a few minutes or submerge in a sink full of water.</li>
            <li>helps to scrub away the oil while leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Treated gently, it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and lessened my acne break-outs as well.</li>
            <li>The sponge should feel completely soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend oil cleansers, as it could damage the natural fibers of the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it’s natural, plus there are no chemicals</li>
            <li>The company started in 1994 and the sponges are 100% natural Eco-friendly, made out of Konjac plants that are grown in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that the sponge smells like authentic green tea and it left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>In recent years I have absolutely moved on from using wash cloths on my face, graduating to facial sponges.</li>
            <li>The green tea only last for first few times but overall it is a nice face cleaning tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for a few weeks, and the string hasn&#x27;t broken, and the sponge is still good as new.  </li>
            <li>sponge comes in a compact package, so I was a little curious at first how this was supposed to work exactly.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the included directions actually suggested storing the sponge in a container in the fridge!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, I notice myself dealing with oily skin and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my SIL (who is Japanese) as a cultural gift.  </li>
            <li>The Green Tea inside is a powerful ingredient used for centuries for its detoxifying and antioxidant benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other facial sponges that lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>First, I thoroughly wash and rinse it out with soap after every use and secondly, I put a thumb tack up in my bathroom to hang it to dry so that it is not sitting on a wet surface.</li>
            <li>Taking care of your skin is important, no matter the time of year; but during the winter, my skin can get so dry in the cold air that I take extra steps to keep it moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>I just soak the sponge in hot water for a few minutes, add a drop of facial soap and use it to massage my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this gentle sponge helped remove the dry patches and the oil in other parts.  </li>

            <li> They are my absolute faves when it comes to cleaning my skin, because the added ingredients help to heal, moisturize and hydrate, and I can use them with or without a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the sponge really helps to control my breakouts as well.  </li>
            <li> I really like using a foaming cleanser, but you can use any cleanser you like.</li>
            <li> You really need to be gentle with the sponge in order to keep it from tearing.  </li>
            <li> For example to not twist gently squeeze.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend removing makeup prior to using this with your cleanser however, and make sure to pay attention to the instructions and gently press your hands together to remove excess cleanser and water from the sponge, otherwise it will tear as it is made with completely natural fibers.</li>
            <li> Once it’s soaked, it expands much larger than the original size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my face feels after using it and the actual sponge itself isn&#x27;t rough at all once it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they also offer Cherry Blossom, Wild Mint, Citrus Fruit, and the popular Natural White, and I can’t wait to try the citrus fruit and wild mint sponges which they also offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also love that they offer different variations of the product for each individual</li>
            <li> Overall, I have enjoyed using The Japanese Konjac Sponge as it does wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Normal exfoliant sponge.  </li>
            <li> I really love this  Green Tea Konjac</li>
            <li> Daily stimulation of the skin cells is a very important part of maintaining the health and vibrancy of your skin, and that is exactly what this little tool is for.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday with a dot of all-natural facial cleanser and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> You don’t want it to be able to get wet all the time if you aren&#x27;t using it (such as when others are taking a shower/bath) since it will fall apart faster.</li>
            <li> sponge cleans up easy after use by simply rinsing and pressing the excess water and cleanser from the sponge, being careful not to twist or wring the sponge, which can damage the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply remove from packaging (sponge will be rough and dense, similar to floral foam) and run under warm water for a few minutes or submerge in a sink full of water.</li>
            <li> helps to scrub away the oil while leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Treated gently, it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and lessened my acne break-outs as well.</li>
            <li> The sponge should feel completely soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend oil cleansers, as it could damage the natural fibers of the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it’s natural, plus there are no chemicals</li>
            <li> The company started in 1994 and the sponges are 100% natural Eco-friendly, made out of Konjac plants that are grown in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that the sponge smells like authentic green tea and it left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> In recent years I have absolutely moved on from using wash cloths on my face, graduating to facial sponges.</li>
            <li> The green tea only last for first few times but overall it is a nice face cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for a few weeks, and the string hasn&#x27;t broken, and the sponge is still good as new.  </li>
            <li> sponge comes in a compact package, so I was a little curious at first how this was supposed to work exactly.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the included directions actually suggested storing the sponge in a container in the fridge!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, I notice myself dealing with oily skin and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my SIL (who is Japanese) as a cultural gift.  </li>
            <li> The Green Tea inside is a powerful ingredient used for centuries for its detoxifying and antioxidant benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other facial sponges that lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> First, I thoroughly wash and rinse it out with soap after every use and secondly, I put a thumb tack up in my bathroom to hang it to dry so that it is not sitting on a wet surface.</li>
            <li> Taking care of your skin is important, no matter the time of year; but during the winter, my skin can get so dry in the cold air that I take extra steps to keep it moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> I just soak the sponge in hot water for a few minutes, add a drop of facial soap and use it to massage my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this gentle sponge helped remove the dry patches and the oil in other parts.  </li>
            <li> Doesn’t last long.</li>
            <li> Trying to live a little greener lifestyle is made easier by products like this Konjac</li>
            <li> Try to keep it as dry as possible when not in use.</li>
            <li> as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always had to deal with dry skin, especially during the cooler months.</li>
            <li> It has a firm texture but not hard like other facial sponges</li>
            <li> As far as the type (meaning Cherry Blossom, Green Tea, Charcoal, etc</li>
            <li> Other konjac sponges I&#x27;ve had have actually said NOT to add any cleanser to it.</li>
            <li> Maybe the occasional acne here and there but other than that, nothing.</li>
            <li> Rinse sponge and hang to dry using the attached string.</li>
            <li> : After a week of use, I place my wet Konjac sponge in a ramekin (that I use specifically for this purpose) with water and microwave it for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Konjac Sponges and do like this one a lot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike the other Konjac sponges that I have tried out this year</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I had never heard of Konjac sponges…now I’m not sure my beauty regimen could ever be the same without one!  </li>
            <li> You don’t want to have to lay it down somewhere to collect germs.</li>
            <li> Not true acne, but just as bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the company that makes this green tea Konjac sponge makes a bunch of other styles, including mint, citrus, and cherry blossom!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin and the green tea</li>
            <li> After using the Green Tea Konjac Puff for almost a week, I noticed a softer, clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice the green tea scent like some people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is infused with Green Tea Extract, which contains an anti-inflammation for acne and an antioxidants to help prevent spots.</li>
            <li> I have a small addiction to these</li>
            <li> so it’s not touching.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a week of use the string fell off and the flat side of it is already falling apart</li>
            <li> I rinsed and squeezed it very carefully, treated it well!!!!</li>
            <li> Yuck, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical that this sponge would even do anything</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other facial sponges that lasted much longer. This felt good initially but fell apart pretty rapidly. It lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I prefer the regular white ones.  This one seemed to have fallen apart a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Does not work as claimed. Normal exfoliant sponge.  Doesn’t last long.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this Japenese Konjac Sponge!! I received one for review purposes but I won&#x27;t sugar coat it for you....I have a small addiction to these and honestly THIS one has to be the best one I have used. I have oily, acne-prone skin and the green tea helps to scrub away the oil while leaving my skin feeling soft. I use this everyday with a dot of all-natural facial cleanser and the results are amazing. Other konjac sponges I&#x27;ve had have actually said NOT to add any cleanser to it. I haven’t had any problems with mine since I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the sponge comes with a loop string to hang it up with. You don’t want to have to lay it down somewhere to collect germs. I hang mine on our shower wall with a suction cup. It hovers just in front of the wall so it’s not touching. Also, make sure to hang it as far away from where water can get to it when not in use. You don’t want it to be able to get wet all the time if you aren&#x27;t using it (such as when others are taking a shower/bath) since it will fall apart faster. Try to keep it as dry as possible when not in use. I made that mistake with another konjac sponge that I had. :( I was surprised to see that the included directions actually suggested storing the sponge in a container in the fridge! I&#x27;ve never heard of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This konjac sponge seems to be thicker, larger and a much better quality than what I have used before. I&#x27;ve had my fair share of brands and types but this Japanese Konjac Sponge is by far my most favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few Konjac Sponges from drugstore to high end, and this brand is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s made in Japan by hand and is quite different than American made Konjac Sponges (this info is on their website).  I&#x27;ve found American made ones to be too soft with a perfect cut.  The Japanese Konjac Sponge is still gentle, but more effective.  It&#x27;s not created by a bunch of machines in a factory, so it doesn&#x27;t have a perfect shape.  It&#x27;s bigger, too.  It feels like it&#x27;s made with more care and quality.  Even the string is much better quality.  I&#x27;ve had this one for a few weeks, and the string hasn&#x27;t broken, and the sponge is still good as new.  As far as the type (meaning Cherry Blossom, Green Tea, Charcoal, etc) I can&#x27;t tell a difference between them with any of the brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to have an alternative to pricey chemical exfoliants.&lt;br /&gt;I hang this up in the shower.  It softens quickly with water, and dries out&lt;br /&gt;totally between uses.  I use it both with my favorite facial cleanser, or alone.&lt;br /&gt;Treated gently, it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I never had to deal with much when it came to my face. Maybe the occasional acne here and there but other than that, nothing. Since having my second daughter, that has changed drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always had to deal with dry skin, especially during the cooler months. Most times I would just slab some aloe on my face and call it a day. Now that I&#x27;m older, I notice myself dealing with oily skin and dry skin. The oily skin is mostly up around the lower part of my forehead and there&#x27;s so much that sometimes I find a glob sitting on the top of my glasses frames. Yuck, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical that this sponge would even do anything but it sure enough did. I love how soft and smooth my face feels after using it and the actual sponge itself isn&#x27;t rough at all once it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the sponge over and over for a total of 4-6 weeks. It&#x27;s not one of those one time use products where you get ripped off. It&#x27;s definitely worth what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they offer different variations of the product for each individual need. They also offer bath sponges for the same purpose as the face except you can use it all over your body. I will definitely be looking into those for future use.</li>
            <li> Daily stimulation of the skin cells is a very important part of maintaining the health and vibrancy of your skin, and that is exactly what this little tool is for. The Green Tea inside is a powerful ingredient used for centuries for its detoxifying and antioxidant benefits. I use this puff twice a day with a creamy cleanser (Komenuka Bijin) and it not only makes my cleanser work better but also helps maintain the smoothness and appearance of my skin. I would recommend removing makeup prior to using this with your cleanser however, and make sure to pay attention to the instructions and gently press your hands together to remove excess cleanser and water from the sponge, otherwise it will tear as it is made with completely natural fibers. If taken care of properly the puff should last almost three months before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I really love this  Green Tea Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a month. I can see my skin has been improved gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and reuse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect and long lasting</li>
            <li> DOES ITS JOB VERY WELL!</li>
            <li> I was happy with this product - it is gentle to the skin and it exfoliates perfect.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The sponge it&#x27;s self is great. Unfortunately after a week of use the string fell off and the flat side of it is already falling apart</li>
            <li> I bought this for my SIL (who is Japanese) as a cultural gift.  She loved it.  The scent was nice, texture was fine, it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin, and left her face feeling refreshed.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this gentle sponge helped remove the dry patches and the oil in other parts.  I highly recommend this sponge.  It&#x27;s does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I had never heard of Konjac sponges…now I’m not sure my beauty regimen could ever be the same without one!  I think that this Japanese Konjac Sponge would be perfect for all skin types to help with facial cleansing.  You can use it on it’s own or with your favorite facial cleanser (which is what I do!).  I love that it is Green Tea scented, but the smell is not at all overwhelming – it’s just perfect.  While using the Konjac sponge, I definitely think that my face feels softer and smoother after cleansing!  (Definitely the main reason I love using it, thank you for allowing me to have the product in exchange for an honest review!)  I can also tell that my face has a nice, healthy glow and maintains the soft and smooth feeling for a long time after cleansing with this sponge.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!!!  This sponge started to tear after two weeks. I rinsed and squeezed it very carefully, treated it well!!!!</li>
            <li> After using the Green Tea Konjac Puff for almost a week, I noticed a softer, clearer skin. The whiteheads on the sides of my nose, which by the way seems to be always there, have lessened a lot. I love how my skin felt smoother and brighter. It&#x27;s very easy to use, relaxing and it works. It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and lessened my acne break-outs as well.</li>
            <li> I love the package design on this sponge. The green tea only last for first few times but overall it is a nice face cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> I love this konjac sponge for my sensitive skin because it is not too abrasive and rubs away makeup like a dream!</li>
            <li> The sponge is very easy to use. Simply remove from packaging (sponge will be rough and dense, similar to floral foam) and run under warm water for a few minutes or submerge in a sink full of water. The sponge should feel completely soft and pliable. Once in this state, you the damp sponge to cleanse your face. You can even add your favorite cleanser for a deeper clean. Rinse sponge and hang to dry using the attached string. The sponge should be replaced every 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese Konjac Sponge was very easy for us to use, gentle on our skin (even for people with sensitive skin) and at only $11.00, a great gift for yourself or a friend!</li>
            <li> In recent years I have absolutely moved on from using wash cloths on my face, graduating to facial sponges. They are my absolute faves when it comes to cleaning my skin, because the added ingredients help to heal, moisturize and hydrate, and I can use them with or without a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love they way they remove dirt and excess oil from my skin - this one being great for oily or combination skin - of which I have the latter.  Using the sponge really helps to control my breakouts as well.  Not true acne, but just as bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes about 5-10 minutes to hydrate the sponge for use. If I’m using cleanser, I apply it directly to the sponge and start to work it in a light circular motion on my face. I really like using a foaming cleanser, but you can use any cleanser you like. I would not recommend oil cleansers, as it could damage the natural fibers of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge cleans up easy after use by simply rinsing and pressing the excess water and cleanser from the sponge, being careful not to twist or wring the sponge, which can damage the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: After a week of use, I place my wet Konjac sponge in a ramekin (that I use specifically for this purpose) with water and microwave it for 2 minutes.  This removes any bacteria from the sponge and does not damage the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a this Konjac sponge is a no brainer! My skin stays looking great. I also use the Konjac sponge with Bamboo Charcoal (which I have also reviewed), and I love it too! they also offer Cherry Blossom, Wild Mint, Citrus Fruit, and the popular Natural White, and I can’t wait to try the citrus fruit and wild mint sponges which they also offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to use, all natural, really works&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pre-soaking (just takes more time for my facial routine - I wanna get right to it, but I have to soak first)&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. some of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product in exchange for an honest review.*&lt;br /&gt;If you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.

            <li> Taking care of your skin is important, no matter the time of year; but during the winter, my skin can get so dry in the cold air that I take extra steps to keep it moisturized and clean. I’ve recently discovered this Green Tea Konjac Sponge that really does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge comes in a compact package, so I was a little curious at first how this was supposed to work exactly. But, I read the directions and watched the instructional video and all was well. Once it’s soaked, it expands much larger than the original size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green tea formula means it’s suitable for oily and combination skin like mine, and with the gentle exfoliation, my skin looks fresh and clean after every use. You can use your favorite cleanser with it or use it alone. I’ve used it both ways and I find that I use less cleanser when I do use any because I feel like the sponge itself does a great job at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the fact that it’s made from a plant so it’s natural, plus there are no chemicals and it’s bio-degradable! Trying to live a little greener lifestyle is made easier by products like this Konjac sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the company that makes this green tea Konjac sponge makes a bunch of other styles, including mint, citrus, and cherry blossom! Make sure you read over the details of each one, because it appears that some are better suited for certain skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate firming action from this konjac sponge but it did make my skin feel extremely smooth. It has a firm texture but not hard like other facial sponges and it does a great job of gently exfoliating your skin. I like that the sponge smells like authentic green tea and it left my skin feeling refreshed. The company recommends replacing the sponge every 4 to 6 weeks, but since it has a porous texture, I take additional measures to keep it clean while using it. First, I thoroughly wash and rinse it out with soap after every use and secondly, I put a thumb tack up in my bathroom to hang it to dry so that it is not sitting on a wet surface. This has really helped keep it in great shape and prevents it from growing mold or mildew in this hot Florida climate. I purchased this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I did not notice the green tea scent like some people have mentioned.  I have tried other Konjac Sponges and do like this one a lot.  It has a rougher cut than others I&#x27;ve tried and it is more exfoliating.  You really need to be gentle with the sponge in order to keep it from tearing.  For example to not twist gently squeeze.  I use this sponge in the morning without any facial cleanser and in the evening with cleanser after wiping off my makeup.  I received this product in exchange for my inspection and honest review.  Thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> While the Konjac Sponge has become popular in the USA in recent years, it has been used overseas in Japan, China and South Korea for over 100 years as a way to exfoliate skin. Of course The Japanese Konjac Sponge is made in Japan! The company started in 1994 and the sponges are 100% natural Eco-friendly, made out of Konjac plants that are grown in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the other Konjac sponges that I have tried out this year, this sponge is slightly bigger. It is meant to help remove blackheads, dirt &amp; oil, exfoliate the skin, cleanse skin pores, hydrate and balance skin pH and eliminates excess sebum. It is 100% biodegradable. It has no harmful chemicals, fragrances or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin always breakouts after I shave, so I&#x27;ve been using the Konjac Sponge to exfoliate my skin after each shave in the mornings. I just soak the sponge in hot water for a few minutes, add a drop of facial soap and use it to massage my face and neck. It feels great. This sponge is infused with Green Tea Extract, which contains an anti-inflammation for acne and an antioxidants to help prevent spots. Overall, I have enjoyed using The Japanese Konjac Sponge as it does wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.
