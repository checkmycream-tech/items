            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>She tried my bottle and immediately bought her own.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple weeks for using this exclusively to realize how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Seems good- but strong.</li>
            <li>Love love this!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every product under the sun and this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is magic for your hair</li>
            <li>Love the way this shampoo lathers and cleans without stripping my hair and the conditioner makes my hair feel like silk</li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair fly away like a VERY fuzzy feather.</li>
            <li>but it does look better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I will always order it until they don&#x27;t sell it any more.</li>
            <li>Love the color of the product and the name - seemed appropriate to use while in the ocean.</li>
            <li>She says it leaves her hair &amp;#34;almost indescribably&amp;#34; silky yet able to hold curls from her curling iron.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>try liquid keratin, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using Jellua for almost a year now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this duo.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and the shampoo smells SO good.</li>
            <li>and I noticed how easily she combed through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a cupboard full of products I have tried but no longer use, many of them brand names.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>super bleached, platinum hair and jellula does wonders for it!</li>
            <li>This squidink shampoo and conditioner is super!  </li>
            <li>and it also looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my stylist - I have light blond hair</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth now instead of frizzy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>I could tell after the first time using this product that my hair was softer and had more shine.</li>
            <li>It does get my hair clean though.</li>
            <li>Hair is squeaky clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Soft, healthy, stunning hair at 56</li>
            <li>I can go 3 days without washing and it still feels clean.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s super important to me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and still have not used it all because I did not think it did anything special</li>
            <li>but when you lather it up its white and doesn&#x27;t harm your hair color wise.</li>
            <li>Leave your hair silky and full of shine.</li>
            <li>and i loved it, but hard to tell because your hair is always nice after a cut and color</li>
            <li>It does leave our hair exceptionally silky and has not darkened my daughters ultra blonde hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length very fine hair which is naturally curly (read unruly)</li>
            <li>The price is excellent for this brand I only use a dime size for long hair.</li>
            <li>I still only put 2 pumps on my scalp but it works amazing.</li>
            <li>It is worth paying the price.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price of the products.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ll finish out this batch before I decide if it&#x60;s worth the price to continue with it or not.</li>
            <li>no real smell to the product good or</li>
            <li>My sister got me the 32oz shampoo and conditioner for $60 and it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>tried it at home with my Fat Hair conditioning thickener and Tahitian hair oil, and my hair has dried very nice without any heat tools.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to maintain clean hair until your next wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly follow the conditioner instructions since it does take along time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go, and have decided that I prefer a regular bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, silly, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Detangles my dry hair and makes very easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS- still love the conditioner, not so much the shampoo.</li>
            <li>All were positive.</li>
            <li>i was freaked out by the color of the product, but it did seem to tone my brassiness in my highlights, which was good for me but not sure for others.</li>
            <li>It actually was so super duper powerful</li>
            <li>and I tried it in my straight hair</li>
            <li>so I think it was to much.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Always detangles my hair and made it much healthier.</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for damaged hair &amp; thin hair.</li>
            <li>sister however, who has thin-medium thickness straight hair with ombre bleaching at the bottom, absolutely loves this shampoo no questions asked.</li>
            <li>She is absolutely raving about it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x60;t really lather.</li>
            <li>the two really are made to work synergistic.</li>
            <li>Your hair and scalp will really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really helps the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and plan on giving away all of my other shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>The price from the two dealers on here is high though.</li>
            <li>That is surprising since I flat iron it everyday.</li>
            <li>I use it on my two little girls who call it miracle stuff because it detangles their hair and they are tender headed so they love it as well.</li>
            <li>My medium brown, color-treated hair felt really smooth, manageable and soft after using the products and letting it dry naturally in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have used Jellua in the past and I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft, curly, shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li>, i have thin long wavy color treated and highlighted hair,shampoo lathers amazing, hair feels clean no residue for sure, condtioner goes on smooth,rinses even smoother, controlled the frizz by at least 90 percent and had softness and volume all day.</li>
            <li>To work to its full potential, the entire conditioning process takes about 20 minutes and you have to apply heat for 5 of those minutes.</li>
            <li>However, looks like Jellua has taken over all distribution, raised the cost $11 from what Big Deal Beauty sold it beginning of May, and as others have noted, the shipping has much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the conditioner is not a &amp;#34;mom of 3 young kids, friendly&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>Did make my hair soft, does stain the tub if you don&#x27;t scrub it immediately .</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Edited - we have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner for nearly 10 months now.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>After she got done washing it, she was able to blow dry my hair and straighten it in less than an hour, and it was straighter than it had ever been.</li>
            <li>Mine is a little dry and more on the thinner side</li>
            <li>I have very dry frizzy hair and my hair is straight and shiny since I have been using this product!</li>
            <li>and I used a styling product I don&#x27;t generally use, and</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with my hair, it was extra soft.</li>
            <li>However, I received my shampoo and conditioner from this seller with shampoo all over the package and the pump was barely attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is the only product I have used that makes my hair soft and manageable with no tangles.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and it gives my hair body and makes it shiny and tangle free!</li>
            <li>I don&#x60;t really see any other major change.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, as I had been using the purple pureology with decent results, but as soon as she started shampooing, I was in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>but like I read in other reviews, it does make a huge mess on your tiles.  </li>

            <li> It makes my hair shiny, silly, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Detangles my dry hair and makes very easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS- still love the conditioner, not so much the shampoo.</li>
            <li> All were positive.</li>
            <li> i was freaked out by the color of the product, but it did seem to tone my brassiness in my highlights, which was good for me but not sure for others.</li>
            <li> It actually was so super duper powerful</li>
            <li> and I tried it in my straight hair</li>
            <li> so I think it was to much.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Always detangles my hair and made it much healthier.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for damaged hair &amp; thin hair.</li>
            <li> sister however, who has thin-medium thickness straight hair with ombre bleaching at the bottom, absolutely loves this shampoo no questions asked.</li>
            <li> She is absolutely raving about it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x60;t really lather.</li>
            <li> the two really are made to work synergistic.</li>
            <li> Your hair and scalp will really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really helps the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on giving away all of my other shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> The price from the two dealers on here is high though.</li>
            <li> That is surprising since I flat iron it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it on my two little girls who call it miracle stuff because it detangles their hair and they are tender headed so they love it as well.</li>
            <li> My medium brown, color-treated hair felt really smooth, manageable and soft after using the products and letting it dry naturally in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have used Jellua in the past and I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft, curly, shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li> , i have thin long wavy color treated and highlighted hair,shampoo lathers amazing, hair feels clean no residue for sure, condtioner goes on smooth,rinses even smoother, controlled the frizz by at least 90 percent and had softness and volume all day.</li>
            <li> To work to its full potential, the entire conditioning process takes about 20 minutes and you have to apply heat for 5 of those minutes.</li>
            <li> However, looks like Jellua has taken over all distribution, raised the cost $11 from what Big Deal Beauty sold it beginning of May, and as others have noted, the shipping has much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the conditioner is not a &amp;#34;mom of 3 young kids, friendly&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Did make my hair soft, does stain the tub if you don&#x27;t scrub it immediately .</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Edited - we have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner for nearly 10 months now.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> After she got done washing it, she was able to blow dry my hair and straighten it in less than an hour, and it was straighter than it had ever been.</li>
            <li> Mine is a little dry and more on the thinner side</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair and my hair is straight and shiny since I have been using this product!</li>
            <li> and I used a styling product I don&#x27;t generally use, and</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with my hair, it was extra soft.</li>
            <li> However, I received my shampoo and conditioner from this seller with shampoo all over the package and the pump was barely attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I have used that makes my hair soft and manageable with no tangles.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it gives my hair body and makes it shiny and tangle free!</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t really see any other major change.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, as I had been using the purple pureology with decent results, but as soon as she started shampooing, I was in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> but like I read in other reviews, it does make a huge mess on your tiles.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and have a few friends using it now as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extra dry from heat and product!  </li>
            <li> This product looks revolting (the shampoo is black, the conditioner is dark brown) but leaves my daughters long processed blonde hair exceptionally soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> As for the product itself, nothing else works on my horribly dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for people who have dry, unrully hair.</li>
            <li> Buttt every other conditioner I have used, I was unable to put on my scalp because it made my hair super oily but not this one!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s sort of thin and very dry at the ends, the first time I used these products I was visiting family</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told be my hair is dry but not damaged!</li>
            <li> I expected my product to arrive in 5 days.</li>
            <li> It is very similar in consistency to a green bottled Kerastase hair mask I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not like I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I still have to use another product to help tame the frizzies (I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender Coconut Organic Hair Creme mixed with Moroccanoil)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a every other day hair washer</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful that products don&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> i will say the color and consitency of the product is diffferent its dark brown and</li>
            <li> part of me feels it may tone down your highlights so beware, for me it may be all in my mind</li>
            <li> It usually take almost 3 hours to blow dry and straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy than it was before.</li>
            <li> and I get it color treated every three and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> It looks black in color</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product due to the fact my hair is very thick, and very coarse.</li>
            <li> My little ethiopian daughters hair is like silk</li>
            <li> This product works well if you have dark colored hair and you are looking to maintain the color, while giving shine and body!  </li>
            <li> it arriving a little messy for the price...</li>
            <li> Adds moisture and calms down my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday so it is pricey.</li>
            <li> We can now comb it in the shower without any crying.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 4 stars this time is because it was so poorly packaged that the shampoo was leaking out all over the package.</li>
            <li> so my hair won&#x27;t go limp.  </li>
            <li> When I took all of the insane bubble rap and tape off, the pump fell off and spilled more shampoo all over my floor.</li>
            <li> I brought the small bottles of shampoo and repair conditioner on my trip to Belize and used it after every day of diving.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has crazy hair and it has completely changed it.  </li>
            <li> plus it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> not sure why everything has to have silicon in it!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li> and I have thin wavy hair</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, forget about this one!</li>
            <li> Very poor company.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My little ethiopian daughters hair is like silk and I tried it in my straight hair and it also looks fabulous. Best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I expected my product to arrive in 5 days. It arrived in 2. Exemplary.  As for the product itself, nothing else works on my horribly dry hair. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Bought it from my hair salon. I don&#x27;t exactly follow the conditioner instructions since it does take along time. Buttt every other conditioner I have used, I was unable to put on my scalp because it made my hair super oily but not this one! I still only put 2 pumps on my scalp but it works amazing. I&#x27;m a every other day hair washer and I have thin wavy hair so it&#x27;s important to maintain clean hair until your next wash. I also battled with frizz during the day and this product tackles it!  Love love this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for processed hair! I have super bleached, platinum hair and jellula does wonders for it!</li>
            <li> great product but came leaked out.</li>
            <li> This is magic for your hair</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! How it smells, how it feels, and especially what it does for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love the way this shampoo lathers and cleans without stripping my hair and the conditioner makes my hair feel like silk</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo and conditioner!  I gave only 4 stars simply because I am not a big fan of the pump container.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go, and have decided that I prefer a regular bottle.</li>
            <li> Packaged great. My hair stylist used a sample from the rep at my last hair appt and I noticed how easily she combed through my hair. So I ordered it. It actually was so super duper powerful, I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with my hair, it was extra soft. I was going to return it but I decided to give it to my stylist and she can use it on me to my her life easier.lol I would recommend this product for people who have dry, unrully hair. Mine is a little dry and more on the thinner side so I think it was to much. I do know others who have used this product and it has worked wonders. Make sure you rinse well. I thought I rinsed it all out but I ended up with a stain on the towel where I squeezed the excess out.</li>
            <li> Love these would deff buy again made my hair feel awesome .. Great buy if your hair is over processed</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist - I have light blond hair and it does not change the color while conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Good stuff will buy again</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner.  However, looks like Jellua has taken over all distribution, raised the cost $11 from what Big Deal Beauty sold it beginning of May, and as others have noted, the shipping has much to be desired.  See attached photo.</li>
            <li> My hair has not felt this good in years... I would recommend this product. It is worth paying the price.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product due to the fact my hair is very thick, and very coarse. I was a little skeptical at first, as I had been using the purple pureology with decent results, but as soon as she started shampooing, I was in love with the smell. After she got done washing it, she was able to blow dry my hair and straighten it in less than an hour, and it was straighter than it had ever been. It usually take almost 3 hours to blow dry and straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed such a difference in my hair since I started using it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a shampoo and conditioner group that had no silicon in it.. not sure why everything has to have silicon in it! It makes my hair fly away like a VERY fuzzy feather. If you have thin hair, forget about this one! I also dislike the smell.... I think the color is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I bought this and still have not used it all because I did not think it did anything special but like I read in other reviews, it does make a huge mess on your tiles.  I think the shampoo is the bigger offender of that.  So, it is not something that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair is thicker but it does look better. I have even had friends compliment my hair and ask what is different.</li>
            <li> I have used Jellua in the past and I absolutely love the product. However, I received my shampoo and conditioner from this seller with shampoo all over the package and the pump was barely attached to the bottle. When I took all of the insane bubble rap and tape off, the pump fell off and spilled more shampoo all over my floor. I tried to contact this seller about the problem and they have not replied...and that was about a month ago. Very poor company.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hairdresser introduced it to me at my last appointment. My hair felt amazing. I have really fine hair so I have to be careful that products don&#x27;t weigh it down. This made it shiny, bouncy with lots of movement. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and the shampoo smells SO good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. My hair feels amazing after I use it and it smells great!! I gave it 4 stars because the conditioner is not a &amp;#34;mom of 3 young kids, friendly&amp;#34; product. To work to its full potential, the entire conditioning process takes about 20 minutes and you have to apply heat for 5 of those minutes. Who has time for that? It&#x27;s great if you can escape once a week for an extended bath time :-)</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended.  It makes my hair feel and look great.  It is well worth the price of the products.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! Always detangles my hair and made it much healthier.</li>
            <li> Love how these products make my hair feel and look! -gena</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for damaged hair &amp; thin hair. You can tell just my the feel of your hair!!</li>
            <li> Love this brand. I will always order it until they don&#x27;t sell it any more.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I brought the small bottles of shampoo and repair conditioner on my trip to Belize and used it after every day of diving.  My medium brown, color-treated hair felt really smooth, manageable and soft after using the products and letting it dry naturally in the sun. I think it helped keep my hair in good condition while on vacation.  Love the color of the product and the name - seemed appropriate to use while in the ocean.</li>
            <li> Did make my hair soft, does stain the tub if you don&#x27;t scrub it immediately . Shampoo is good, will use again</li>
            <li> My hair is extra dry from heat and product!  This product is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for me, prevents damage, and detangles my hair.  My hair is smooth now instead of frizzy.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair care products I have ever tried.  Adds moisture and calms down my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever.  However, the bottles do leak during transportation.  Upside is this product removes build up, mildew from hair and restore shine.  Worth it arriving a little messy for the price...plus it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s sort of thin and very dry at the ends, the first time I used these products I was visiting family and I used a styling product I don&#x27;t generally use, and I did not like the end result at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it at home with my Fat Hair conditioning thickener and Tahitian hair oil, and my hair has dried very nice without any heat tools. I like it a lot. It is very similar in consistency to a green bottled Kerastase hair mask I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister however, who has thin-medium thickness straight hair with ombre bleaching at the bottom, absolutely loves this shampoo no questions asked. She tried my bottle and immediately bought her own. She is absolutely raving about it. She says it leaves her hair &amp;#34;almost indescribably&amp;#34; silky yet able to hold curls from her curling iron.</li>
            <li> Awesome duo. Great product makes your hair silky and smooth</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended I get this product. I read all of the  reviews. All were positive. A client of mine raved about it. I&#x60;ve been using it for a few weeks now.  The shampoo doesn&#x60;t really lather. It does get my hair clean though. I wash my hair everyday so it is pricey. My hair is less frizzy than it was before. I don&#x60;t really see any other major change. I&#x60;ll finish out this batch before I decide if it&#x60;s worth the price to continue with it or not. I&#x60;ll edit this review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Seems good- but strong. Detangles my dry hair and makes very easy to comb through. Hair is squeaky clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> It did not work well on my hair. Not like I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I have very dry frizzy hair and my hair is straight and shiny since I have been using this product! My hairdresser told be my hair is dry but not damaged! That is surprising since I flat iron it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product works well if you have dark colored hair and you are looking to maintain the color, while giving shine and body!  It also helps prevent hair breakage and hair loss.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> my hairdressor used this on my hair and i loved it, but hard to tell because your hair is always nice after a cut and color so i bought it, i have thin long wavy color treated and highlighted hair,shampoo lathers amazing, hair feels clean no residue for sure, condtioner goes on smooth,rinses even smoother, controlled the frizz by at least 90 percent and had softness and volume all day. love it. i will say the color and consitency of the product is diffferent its dark brown and part of me feels it may tone down your highlights so beware, for me it may be all in my mind cause i was freaked out by the color of the product, but it did seem to tone my brassiness in my highlights, which was good for me but not sure for others. no real smell to the product good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS- still love the conditioner, not so much the shampoo. try liquid keratin, love this stuff. I now rotate jellua and that.</li>
            <li> You will be hooked.  Soft, healthy, stunning hair at 56 and I get it color treated every three and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jellua for almost a year now and absolutely love it.  My daughter is biracial and has crazy hair and it has completely changed it.  We can now comb it in the shower without any crying. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the difference! And to anyone who&#x27;s wondering... It looks black in color but when you lather it up its white and doesn&#x27;t harm your hair color wise. Great product!</li>
            <li> I simply love this duo.  The conditioner leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft and silky.  I cannot imagine not having this shampoo and conditioner treatment.  I have tried another shampoo with the conditioner...the two really are made to work synergistic.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have thin hair and it gives my hair body and makes it shiny and tangle free! I use it on my two little girls who call it miracle stuff because it detangles their hair and they are tender headed so they love it as well.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the color, this is a rich nicely scented hair care product with excellent management reality.  Your hair and scalp will really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  I could tell after the first time using this product that my hair was softer and had more shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every product under the sun and this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m on my 4th set.  I have medium length very fine hair which is naturally curly (read unruly) and this stuff really helps the frizz.  I can go 3 days without washing and it still feels clean.  I love the smell of it!!  That&#x27;s super important to me.  It took me a couple weeks for using this exclusively to realize how much I liked it.  I hope Amazon keeps offering it, it&#x27;s a better deal than at the salon!  I highly recommend and have a few friends using it now as well.  They all love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and absolutely love it. The only reason it gets 4 stars this time is because it was so poorly packaged that the shampoo was leaking out all over the package. Not very impressed to say the least. Like I said, the product is great!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It makes my hair shiny, silly, and smells great! I have been getting a lot of compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Leave your hair silky and full of shine.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Makes my hair so soft and silky.  Fantastic</li>
            <li> This squidink shampoo and conditioner is super!  I only use it 3 times a week. What a difference in my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas as per her request.  She say&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best shampoo she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> I now sell this in my salon!  There isn&#x27;t another product like this AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Asian beauty products have it all over domestic ones.  This product looks revolting (the shampoo is black, the conditioner is dark brown) but leaves my daughters long processed blonde hair exceptionally soft and silky.  Amazing product.  Edited - we have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner for nearly 10 months now.  It does leave our hair exceptionally silky and has not darkened my daughters ultra blonde hair at all.  I am a big fan of Korean beauty products</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo/repair conditioner after a double process on my hair.  I love how my hair smells and feels after shampooing!  I have fine hair so I only use once a week so my hair won&#x27;t go limp.  It definitely saves me constant trips to the salon for end trimming.  The price is excellent for this brand I only use a dime size for long hair.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES these products! Says they make her hair feel and seem very healthy! The smell is pretty good too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I have very curly, coarse, frizzy hair. A friend of mine told me about this and I wanted to try it. This product is the only product I have used that makes my hair soft and manageable with no tangles. I have a cupboard full of products I have tried but no longer use, many of them brand names. I left the conditioner in my hair overnight as an experiment and my hair literally \\&quot;sucked\\&quot; it up. It was softer than ever. I still have to use another product to help tame the frizzies (I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender Coconut Organic Hair Creme mixed with Moroccanoil) and that&#x27;s it, my hair is soft, curly, shiny and manageable! I love this product and plan on giving away all of my other shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s. The price from the two dealers on here is high though. My sister got me the 32oz shampoo and conditioner for $60 and it is worth every cent. I would give this product 6 stars if I could.</li>
