            <li>The 3.4oz cost around $40 or more in retail stores (Sam&#x27;s Club,Macys etc), and to pay around $25 for it is an amazing value.</li>

            <li>Not too strong, and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to smell nice.  </li>

            <li>I fell in love with it, had to get some.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love her perfume, great buy and fast delivery</li>
            <li>My Rhianna perfume that I love to wear is defective.  </li>
            <li>But this one I&#x27;m falling more and more in love with the more I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not here to take side for 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera OR Rihanna.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this perfume.</li>
            <li>I am just in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and she fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my #1 favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am a fan for life, and can&#x27;t wait untill Rihannaa releases more fragrances.</li>
            <li>marc Jacobs ect, but this one I love</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but i still love it anyway.</li>
            <li>She said is smells flirty and sexy.</li>
            <li>He seemed drawn to me more than ever.</li>
            <li>Im glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall the perfume is excellent.</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost better for fall/winter</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like most women&#x27;s perfume, it&#x27;s not flowery, fruity or powdery, it could almost be a men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>definitely  a good fragrance, is a sweet but strong smell</li>
            <li>Happy in new york.</li>
            <li>A nice light and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped that it was</li>
            <li>This has a gorgeous scent to it and last a nice time for a day.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be okay if you don&#x27;t mind the scent fading quickly.</li>
            <li>I love Rhianna&#x27;s first scent!</li>
            <li>This was a birthday gift for my daughter, the bottle was huge for the price</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cheap and gaudy....</li>
            <li>She said it smelled good, but also that it smelled like Old Spice, which I&#x27;ve never cared for.  </li>
            <li>I have nasal allergies, so strong sweet perfumes kill me.</li>
            <li>ALMOST USED THE WHOLE BOTTLE!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this perfume online since it is no longer available at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I heard Rihanna&#x27;s perfume was pretty good for decent money @Amazon.</li>
            <li>actual fragrance is very unique to celebrity scents and better than many designer brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im not usually one to get celebrity products but this perfume smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to overpowering, just the right amount of sweet!</li>
            <li>It smells clean, light and fresh.</li>
            <li>the color of the perfume was brown instead of a light golden color, which should have told me that something was up.  </li>
            <li>wife likes sweet but not overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>so if you have a wife, daughter, a friend that likes sweet scents then this is one to get for mothers day or just for being who they are.</li>
            <li>I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li>I got the Reb&#x27;l perfume as a gift last year and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Where as 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera lasts for a whole day with just one spray which I want to smell all the time.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this perfume, and I enjoyed smelling it on her.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my daughter but decided to keep this one (thats how good it smells, I ordered her another).</li>
            <li>it is simple, light and elegant!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s A*Men Pure Havane on my husband, and this Rihanna Rebelle perfume smells like it&#x27;s feminine twin sister!</li>
            <li>The scent&lt;br /&gt;also seems to fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>one of the richest smelling scents made by Rihanna.&lt;br /&gt;the box for this fragrance is very intriguing with its gold and red adding for a very loyal look.&lt;br /&gt;the bottle also looks elegant with its gold rim on the stopper and the very sexy red ribon around the bottle and gold liquid&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>A gorgeous scent that starts out bold with dark coffee and patchouli, but eventually settles into a light vanilla that I can still smell hours after applying.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sweet, has hints of musky vanilla and does what most winter ( sweet scents) in this price range lack, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or as if you have fallen into a giant tub of fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for young people, you need to be able to \\&quot;carry\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and soft frangance and nice, it can be used  in the moornings, I like it so much, my friends like it, too.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away</li>
            <li>It is a very strong, gourmand that i can wear out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Both of them smell incredible, and last a very long time on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the large bottle too!</li>
            <li>Me husband is sensitive to strong perfumes but this one does not affect him at all.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>: I placed this order on Friday 4/26 and received it in the mail on Wednesday 5/1, which I thought was very fast service because my estimated delivery date was 5/2-5/7.</li>
            <li>I still love the smell of the perfume, but this bottle did not have the same smell.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume in a magazine, and after some research and reading some reviews I decided to purchase one...</li>
            <li>Well turns out I purchased two, because I got an error message the first time and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, for the first 10 seconds I put this on</li>
            <li>I also love Christina Aguiler&#x27;s Inspire and Red Sin</li>
            <li>I am a boy, and most women fragrances will not last on me.</li>
            <li>Beside of my love for rihanna personally, and her music, is her fragrances.</li>
            <li>My only problem is getting the top off.  </li>
            <li>I bought this without smelling it first...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this fragrance is has a long staying power, its a sexy and sophisticated (can be worn in the evening or for a casual day out).</li>
            <li>My friend said it may have a strong \\&quot;musk\\&quot; to it, and when she took a little of it and rubbed it a lot it did end up smelling a bit better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its very dark, sexy, and surprisingly tropical.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that a MAN can easily wear this fragrance because of the opulent and not so delicate smell</li>
            <li>I am more a fan of smells such as Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Love Rihanna and this perfume, will be definitely ordering more of this soon and the other fragrances as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet nor flowery nor resembles to any kind of spice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The imitial spray with a very sweet berry smell with a sharp and fresh ginger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it within two days of my order which is so fast...</li>
            <li>Very musky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it how others have commented saying it lasts for a whole day.</li>
            <li>My wife says she really likes this smell.  </li>
            <li>It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It was very well priced as well</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the catch, the smell is, like everybody says, a little bit of vanilla, sweet with a hint of strong spice smell.</li>
            <li>, this is a go-to scent for me at a fraction of the price of my normal go-to perfumes!</li>
            <li>I got a small one for Christmas, and it smells great on me, had to buy a big one...</li>
            <li>The main notes that you detect are the cofee beans, and the vanilla.</li>
            <li>A heavy, nighttime/winter scent, to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Rhianna killed this fragrance so inexpensive department store wanted much more</li>
            <li>: I LOVE this scent, however it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>I originally got this in a gift set with two other scents.</li>
            <li>first and last time I&#x27;ll ever do that!  </li>
            <li>I will make sure to find the black ribbon shape, NOT the red ribbon shape.</li>
            <li>you are one of those frequent fragrance users than you have a variety of what you call winter and summer scents.</li>
            <li>But IT DOES NOT LAST FOR A WHOLE DAY.</li>
            <li>It is soft, powdery and feminine.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a little hard for me to grip and spray at the same time, but it&#x27;s design is beautiful and the scent is intoxicating so I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Due to the design of the bottle (which is pretty) its hard to get the top off and awkard to spray.  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The top is broken and I can&#x27;t spray it.</li>
            <li>it smelled great, and then It made me feel sick and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>I think Rihanna really has a hit with this one, My mom doesn&#x27;t even want to try her other fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for all ages but not as mature and and not good to make this as a signature scent some people prefer since this type is a bit too common.</li>

            <li> But this one I&#x27;m falling more and more in love with the more I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not here to take side for 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera OR Rihanna.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this perfume.</li>
            <li> I am just in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> and she fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a fan for life, and can&#x27;t wait untill Rihannaa releases more fragrances.</li>
            <li> marc Jacobs ect, but this one I love</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but i still love it anyway.</li>
            <li> She said is smells flirty and sexy.</li>
            <li> He seemed drawn to me more than ever.</li>
            <li> Im glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall the perfume is excellent.</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost better for fall/winter</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like most women&#x27;s perfume, it&#x27;s not flowery, fruity or powdery, it could almost be a men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> definitely  a good fragrance, is a sweet but strong smell</li>
            <li> Happy in new york.</li>
            <li> A nice light and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped that it was</li>
            <li> This has a gorgeous scent to it and last a nice time for a day.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be okay if you don&#x27;t mind the scent fading quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Rhianna&#x27;s first scent!</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter, the bottle was huge for the price</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cheap and gaudy....</li>
            <li> She said it smelled good, but also that it smelled like Old Spice, which I&#x27;ve never cared for.  </li>
            <li> I have nasal allergies, so strong sweet perfumes kill me.</li>
            <li> ALMOST USED THE WHOLE BOTTLE!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this perfume online since it is no longer available at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I heard Rihanna&#x27;s perfume was pretty good for decent money @Amazon.</li>
            <li> actual fragrance is very unique to celebrity scents and better than many designer brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im not usually one to get celebrity products but this perfume smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to overpowering, just the right amount of sweet!</li>
            <li> It smells clean, light and fresh.</li>
            <li> the color of the perfume was brown instead of a light golden color, which should have told me that something was up.  </li>
            <li> wife likes sweet but not overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> so if you have a wife, daughter, a friend that likes sweet scents then this is one to get for mothers day or just for being who they are.</li>
            <li> I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li> I got the Reb&#x27;l perfume as a gift last year and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Where as 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera lasts for a whole day with just one spray which I want to smell all the time.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this perfume, and I enjoyed smelling it on her.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my daughter but decided to keep this one (thats how good it smells, I ordered her another).</li>
            <li> it is simple, light and elegant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s A*Men Pure Havane on my husband, and this Rihanna Rebelle perfume smells like it&#x27;s feminine twin sister!</li>
            <li> The scent&lt;br /&gt;also seems to fade quickly.  </li>
            <li> one of the richest smelling scents made by Rihanna.&lt;br /&gt;the box for this fragrance is very intriguing with its gold and red adding for a very loyal look.&lt;br /&gt;the bottle also looks elegant with its gold rim on the stopper and the very sexy red ribon around the bottle and gold liquid&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> A gorgeous scent that starts out bold with dark coffee and patchouli, but eventually settles into a light vanilla that I can still smell hours after applying.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sweet, has hints of musky vanilla and does what most winter ( sweet scents) in this price range lack, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or as if you have fallen into a giant tub of fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for young people, you need to be able to \\&quot;carry\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and soft frangance and nice, it can be used  in the moornings, I like it so much, my friends like it, too.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away</li>
            <li> It is a very strong, gourmand that i can wear out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Both of them smell incredible, and last a very long time on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the large bottle too!</li>
            <li> Me husband is sensitive to strong perfumes but this one does not affect him at all.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> : I placed this order on Friday 4/26 and received it in the mail on Wednesday 5/1, which I thought was very fast service because my estimated delivery date was 5/2-5/7.</li>
            <li> I still love the smell of the perfume, but this bottle did not have the same smell.  </li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume in a magazine, and after some research and reading some reviews I decided to purchase one...</li>
            <li> Well turns out I purchased two, because I got an error message the first time and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, for the first 10 seconds I put this on</li>
            <li> I also love Christina Aguiler&#x27;s Inspire and Red Sin</li>
            <li> I am a boy, and most women fragrances will not last on me.</li>
            <li> Beside of my love for rihanna personally, and her music, is her fragrances.</li>
            <li> My only problem is getting the top off.  </li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it first...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this fragrance is has a long staying power, its a sexy and sophisticated (can be worn in the evening or for a casual day out).</li>
            <li> My friend said it may have a strong \\&quot;musk\\&quot; to it, and when she took a little of it and rubbed it a lot it did end up smelling a bit better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its very dark, sexy, and surprisingly tropical.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that a MAN can easily wear this fragrance because of the opulent and not so delicate smell</li>
            <li> I am more a fan of smells such as Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Love Rihanna and this perfume, will be definitely ordering more of this soon and the other fragrances as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet nor flowery nor resembles to any kind of spice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The imitial spray with a very sweet berry smell with a sharp and fresh ginger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it within two days of my order which is so fast...</li>
            <li> Very musky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it how others have commented saying it lasts for a whole day.</li>
            <li> My wife says she really likes this smell.  </li>
            <li> It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It was very well priced as well</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the catch, the smell is, like everybody says, a little bit of vanilla, sweet with a hint of strong spice smell.</li>
            <li> , this is a go-to scent for me at a fraction of the price of my normal go-to perfumes!</li>
            <li> I got a small one for Christmas, and it smells great on me, had to buy a big one...</li>
            <li> The main notes that you detect are the cofee beans, and the vanilla.</li>
            <li> A heavy, nighttime/winter scent, to be sure.  </li>
            <li> Rhianna killed this fragrance so inexpensive department store wanted much more</li>
            <li> : I LOVE this scent, however it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I originally got this in a gift set with two other scents.</li>
            <li> first and last time I&#x27;ll ever do that!  </li>
            <li> I will make sure to find the black ribbon shape, NOT the red ribbon shape.</li>
            <li> you are one of those frequent fragrance users than you have a variety of what you call winter and summer scents.</li>
            <li> But IT DOES NOT LAST FOR A WHOLE DAY.</li>
            <li> It is soft, powdery and feminine.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells like Old Spice.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little hard for me to grip and spray at the same time, but it&#x27;s design is beautiful and the scent is intoxicating so I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Due to the design of the bottle (which is pretty) its hard to get the top off and awkard to spray.  </li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The top is broken and I can&#x27;t spray it.</li>
            <li> it smelled great, and then It made me feel sick and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I think Rihanna really has a hit with this one, My mom doesn&#x27;t even want to try her other fragrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for all ages but not as mature and and not good to make this as a signature scent some people prefer since this type is a bit too common.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed only because I love the scent so much...</li>
            <li> The lasting power is inredible, which is quite strange for me.</li>
            <li> Since the price, is less than half of what i paid for the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine a few months ago and was surprised, I assumed anything being marketed by a pop singer would be cheesy smelling, but it has a rich, deep earthy smell that is very similar to Donna Karan&#x27;s Black Cashmere, which is nearly $300 for the same size</li>
            <li> The smell is off by a long shot, so I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, I spent $20 on a 1.0 version of this fragrance for a Christmas present for her</li>
            <li> And I have only had it since 5/1 (16 days) and the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> people that probably found this apealing must be old farts that like that smelly nasty thinking its good scent.</li>
            <li> This is a complex scent with a patchouli/civet base and a caramel top note that dries down quickly (thankfully!)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep chocolately-smell with a slight musk-type smell to it.</li>
            <li> I used this one up so quick and was so sad to hear that they no longer make it.</li>
            <li> Just like her robotic and inane music, she releases a recycled fragrance that will no doubt be pulled from department  stores just like J.Lo, Mariah, Halle, and every other celebrity fragrance who tries to capitalize on their fleeting fame.</li>
            <li> The bottle is gaudy and horrible, something I hide in my medicine cabinet, to be honest!  </li>
            <li> But other than that the product was as intended.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to perfume.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my daughter for Christmas came down stairs one morning and all of her friends were putting it on before school, just giggling away.</li>
            <li> After about a half hour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday since it arrived.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it, as I&#x27;ll never wear it.</li>
            <li> My mom likes it because she says it has a sweet subtle smell, and not too overpowering because she gets sick off a lot of perfume smells but loves this.</li>
            <li> serious dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells like the tail end of a hard night out after you had on a quality fragrance like Chanel no.5, and you sweated, had drinks poured on you, took a nap in a dumpster, and didn&#x27;t bathe for about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but the bottle sucks.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived leaking, the cover falling apart and paint peeling off, and the bottle appeared to be shoddily painted by hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cocoa, coffe, and pachouli are noticable throught the fragrance&#x27;s evolution as Rebelle approaches the base it gets alot sweeter but a creamy dark</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING sensual about this fragrance, except her photo on the package, and even that is tiresome.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with it</li>
            <li> i mean really bad.</li>
            <li> it was bad.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Dont hesitate to buy, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> this perfume smells horrible.</li>
            <li> it smells like a horrible cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Very annoying!</li>

            <li> I love this I got it for me for Christmas :D</li>
            <li> I still love the smell of the perfume, but this bottle did not have the same smell.  I noticed right away the color of the perfume was brown instead of a light golden color, which should have told me that something was up.  The smell is off by a long shot, so I don&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s a shame, considering the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this perfume online since it is no longer available at Macy&#x27;s. Great price too!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for my wife as a pre-mother&#x27;s day gift. We had a heated discussion about which one of Rihanna&#x27;s fragrances to buy. I had my heart on the \\&quot;black\\&quot; bottle but my 7 year old daughter made a very good argument in why to but this one.&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those frequent fragrance users than you have a variety of what you call winter and summer scents. I know most none users have no idea but if you are like my wife than you do, lol...&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes sweet but not overpowering scents. This fragrance is just that, it&#x27;s sweet, has hints of musky vanilla and does what most winter ( sweet scents) in this price range lack, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or as if you have fallen into a giant tub of fragrance. Honestly, there aren&#x27;t too many fragrances for this price that smell as comforting, sexy and delicious as this one. I would not recommend this for young people, you need to be able to \\&quot;carry\\&quot; this fragrance so if you have a wife, daughter, a friend that likes sweet scents then this is one to get for mothers day or just for being who they are. Enjoy</li>
            <li> I smelled this scent on a lady I work with. I fell in love with it, had to get some. This is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I originally got this in a gift set with two other scents. I used this one up so quick and was so sad to hear that they no longer make it. I had given up hope until I realized Amazon has everything lol! I love the huge bottle, it looks gorgeous on my dresser! I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday since it arrived. It&#x27;s not to overpowering, just the right amount of sweet! Definitely my signature scent now!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend and she loved it.  Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great scent!  Not too strong, and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to smell nice.  Hence, it should last a while.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume at a lower always awesome amazon price :)</li>
            <li> Scent lasts all night without refreshing it. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this...she is 14</li>
            <li> this is by far the best  cologne out there!! its a perfect combo of floral/spicy, lasts for hours on you, n i think its grt for all ages. def a *5 star* imo!!</li>

            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve seen in the market for this size .  And love the smell. Saved this seller for its best price</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter, the bottle was huge for the price so I went for it. I love the scent and my daugher loves it. Will get another one as stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realise that this perfume would have smelled so good - I love it and would recommend it to everyone -</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped that it was but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> LOVE ME SO REBEL FLEUR.........</li>
            <li> this perfume smells horrible. i got a sample from another perfume i bought. it was bad. i mean really bad. it smells like a horrible cologne for men. serious dont waste your money on this. people that probably found this apealing must be old farts that like that smelly nasty thinking its good scent. like my grama.</li>
            <li> Just like her robotic and inane music, she releases a recycled fragrance that will no doubt be pulled from department  stores just like J.Lo, Mariah, Halle, and every other celebrity fragrance who tries to capitalize on their fleeting fame.

The bottle is gaudy and horrible, something I hide in my medicine cabinet, to be honest!  But this fragrance always gets me compliments and questions about what it is when I wear it, so move over Jo Malone and Diptyque, this is a go-to scent for me at a fraction of the price of my normal go-to perfumes!</li>
            <li> Smells good after using it lol</li>
            <li> Amazing! Just can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>

            <li> love her perfume, great buy and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume in a magazine, and after some research and reading some reviews I decided to purchase one...Well turns out I purchased two, because I got an error message the first time and so re-bought it, but both orders went though, and Amazon would not cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, for the first 10 seconds I put this on it smelled great, and then It made me feel sick and gave me a headache. My friend said it may have a strong \\&quot;musk\\&quot; to it, and when she took a little of it and rubbed it a lot it did end up smelling a bit better. I still can&#x27;t stand the smell though. I am more a fan of smells such as Light Blue.</li>
            <li> I got the Reb&#x27;l perfume as a gift last year and absolutely loved it. Strangers complimented me. I thought I was buying the same because I couldn&#x27;t remember the name (not on bottle)but I knew it started with an \\&quot;R\\&quot;. This is NOT the same. Very musky. Should be for men or as a deodorant. It&#x27;s not bad, but too sweet smelling. Like a sugar cookie. A male sugar cookie. I will make sure to find the black ribbon shape, NOT the red ribbon shape. BIG difference.</li>
            <li> My Rhianna perfume that I love to wear is defective.  The top is broken and I can&#x27;t spray it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume. I had to hide it so my daughter would not use it all. Great price.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived leaking with only ¾ of the perfume left in the bottle. But other than that the product was as intended.</li>
            <li> smells awesome. bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. definitely  a good fragrance, is a sweet but strong smell</li>
            <li> I love Rhianna&#x27;s first scent! But this one I&#x27;m falling more and more in love with the more I wear it. I usually don&#x27;t buy perfume without testing it out first but I made an exception for this one and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Dont hesitate to buy, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Rhianna killed this fragrance so inexpensive department store wanted much more</li>
            <li> I heard Rihanna&#x27;s perfume was pretty good for decent money @Amazon. I read a lot of comments and did went to Macy&#x27;s to try it out but they were out on this one so I didn&#x27;t have any idea of how it would smell. So I bought it and the shipping was amazing. The bottle&#x27;s fancy and the amount is satisfactory for the price that&#x27;s on Amazon. Here&#x27;s the catch, the smell is, like everybody says, a little bit of vanilla, sweet with a hint of strong spice smell. It&#x27;s very feminine. I&#x27;m not complaining about the smell at all. It&#x27;s good for all ages but not as mature and and not good to make this as a signature scent some people prefer since this type is a bit too common. But IT DOES NOT LAST FOR A WHOLE DAY. I don&#x27;t get it how others have commented saying it lasts for a whole day. Maybe they spray like 10 times to make it last. Where as 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera lasts for a whole day with just one spray which I want to smell all the time. I love this. It&#x27;s not sweet nor flowery nor resembles to any kind of spice. It has got it&#x27;s own kind of smell which is so alluring yet light and delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not here to take side for 212 Sexy By Carolina Herrera OR Rihanna. I&#x27;m here to comment on how I felt using these two perfumes and how they differ.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS THE BOMB.COM I GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS FROM MY BROTHER-IN-LAW I PLAN TO GET ANOTHER BOTTLE IT&#x27;S ONLY BEEN 1 MONTH AND I&#x27;VE ALMOST USED THE WHOLE BOTTLE!!!</li>
            <li> gracias x enviarlo excelente</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this perfume. I am obsessed with it it smells sooooooooo good! I also love Christina Aguiler&#x27;s Inspire and Red Sin those two are a must have for any perfume loves like myself out there. I am just in love with this fragrance. People compliment me on it all the time. One of the best perfumes out there on the market now ;)</li>
            <li> Brought this for my daughter for Christmas came down stairs one morning and all of her friends were putting it on before school, just giggling away.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order this thinking it would be too string, but I am happy to say it is not. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, I spent $20 on a 1.0 version of this fragrance for a Christmas present for her and she fell in love with the smell. So I upgraded to this larger version for Mother&#x27;s Day. The 3.4oz cost around $40 or more in retail stores (Sam&#x27;s Club,Macys etc), and to pay around $25 for it is an amazing value. My mom likes it because she says it has a sweet subtle smell, and not too overpowering because she gets sick off a lot of perfume smells but loves this. I think Rihanna really has a hit with this one, My mom doesn&#x27;t even want to try her other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to perfume. This is my #1 favorite perfume. I am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> The bottle was gorgeous &amp; the perfume was okay but it is not a smell that matches my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Smells like a warm hug</li>
            <li> I tried this scent on in a department store and really liked it.  However this one I purchased on this site seems to have a weaker scent.  The scent&lt;br /&gt;also seems to fade quickly.  After about a half hour or so I can&#x27;t smell it anymore on my wrist.  It seems to be okay if you don&#x27;t mind the scent fading quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s A*Men Pure Havane on my husband, and this Rihanna Rebelle perfume smells like it&#x27;s feminine twin sister! A gorgeous scent that starts out bold with dark coffee and patchouli, but eventually settles into a light vanilla that I can still smell hours after applying. The bottle is a little hard for me to grip and spray at the same time, but it&#x27;s design is beautiful and the scent is intoxicating so I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care Rhianna much, but I LOVE her fragrance!!! Always lots of compliments when I wear it!! Well done!!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> AMAZING SCENT! Didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but the bottle sucks. Sometimes it sprays, and sometimes the perfume just drips out. Very annoying!</li>
            <li> This fragrance, is amazing. The main notes that you detect are the cofee beans, and the vanilla. It is a very strong, gourmand that i can wear out on a daily basis. I purchased my bottle from a local department store, and i am nearing the end of the bottle. Within the next couple of weeks, i am going to purchse another bottle from Amazon. Since the price, is less than half of what i paid for the first bottle. The lasting power is inredible, which is quite strange for me. I am a boy, and most women fragrances will not last on me. Beside of my love for rihanna personally, and her music, is her fragrances. Both of them smell incredible, and last a very long time on my skin. I get about 8-10 hours out of this scent, and great sillage. I have dozens of people to come up and ask me what i am wearing. This doesn&#x27;t happen when i wear another fragrance besides this one. I am a fan for life, and can&#x27;t wait untill Rihannaa releases more fragrances.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cheap and gaudy.... But the fragrance is anything but.  it is simple, light and elegant! I have nasal allergies, so strong sweet perfumes kill me. This fragrance is perfect! It smells clean, light and fresh. I am so glad I found it in Redbook, and then was able to buy it on amazon prime at a great price!</li>
            <li> I currently have over 70 perfumes from Gucci. marc Jacobs ect, but this one I love , u put some and last all day , awesome smell soft I love it</li>
            <li> This has a gorgeous scent to it and last a nice time for a day.  My only problem is getting the top off.  Due to the design of the bottle (which is pretty) its hard to get the top off and awkard to spray.  Maybe its just me but i still love it anyway.</li>
            <li> My wife says she really likes this smell.  It has a different smell to it that she likes to use when not in a work place setting.  She said is smells flirty and sexy.</li>
            <li> excelente lo recomiendo, puntual y la colonia esquisita Una de las mejores fragancias para damas que se pueden encontrar. Tan bueno como regular</li>
            <li> Just got home from worked and received this perfume. It is more than I expected.  It is soft, powdery and feminine. Me husband is sensitive to strong perfumes but this one does not affect him at all. In fact it has the opposite effect. He seemed drawn to me more than ever.Im glad I made this purchase. The decorative bbottle even adds to my decor. Go rhinna this one&#x27;s a hit. Happy in new york.</li>
            <li> Love Rihanna and this perfume, will be definitely ordering more of this soon and the other fragrances as well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition and the smell is awesome. My wife absolutely loves this perfume, and I enjoyed smelling it on her. Overall the perfume is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it first...first and last time I&#x27;ll ever do that!  I spritzed some on my wrist, then later had a co-worker smell it.  She said it smelled good, but also that it smelled like Old Spice, which I&#x27;ve never cared for.  Yes, it smells like Old Spice. Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it, as I&#x27;ll never wear it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my daughter but decided to keep this one (thats how good it smells, I ordered her another). I&#x27;m so happy with this fragrance is has a long staying power, its a sexy and sophisticated (can be worn in the evening or for a casual day out).</li>
            <li> 5/2/2013: I placed this order on Friday 4/26 and received it in the mail on Wednesday 5/1, which I thought was very fast service because my estimated delivery date was 5/2-5/7. The perfume bottle was beautifully packaged and it smells great! It was very well priced as well and I would order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/17/2013: I LOVE this scent, however it does not last very long. And I have only had it since 5/1 (16 days) and the bottle is almost empty. I have never had this happen before with any perfume that I have purchased...and I don&#x27;t even use it more than once a day! It&#x27;s the large bottle too! I had to lower my rating to 3 stars for that reason only. I am disappointed only because I love the scent so much...</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packaged very well. LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s almost better for fall/winter but I will continue to wear into spring/summer. It&#x27;s a deep chocolately-smell with a slight musk-type smell to it. I love it. Sexy scent!</li>
            <li> Im not usually one to get celebrity products but this perfume smells amazing. A nice light and fresh smell. I recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Is smell good but go faster</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived leaking, the cover falling apart and paint peeling off, and the bottle appeared to be shoddily painted by hand.</li>
            <li> Best scent ever! I bought the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; &amp; it doesn&#x27;t compare to this!</li>
            <li> I smelled this in Style Mag... I ordered it the next day from Amazon. I think its one of the best parfume I have ever purchased. I want to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine a few months ago and was surprised, I assumed anything being marketed by a pop singer would be cheesy smelling, but it has a rich, deep earthy smell that is very similar to Donna Karan&#x27;s Black Cashmere, which is nearly $300 for the same size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like most women&#x27;s perfume, it&#x27;s not flowery, fruity or powdery, it could almost be a men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am very happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for xmas. I really like the scent and my wife does as well.. She says it smells like something an ethnic women would wear.. Smells very nice!</li>
