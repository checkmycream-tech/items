            <li>Best lip scrub ever!</li>
            <li>Works amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I recomend this product but suggest using it when you plan on using lip tints not thinking it will make your lips perfect all the time .</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Really good product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ashamed because the idea of a lip scrub with a softening lotion is great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really pleasant</li>
            <li>Would be good for a child or something.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Very cute product but a bit pricey .</li>
            <li>My lips feel beautiful and smooth after scrub.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is so very cute and the lid stays on nicely even in my bag.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking of ordering more because I&#x27;m going to probably use this every day!</li>

            <li>Nice lip scrub, I love the packaging!</li>

            <li>But still a nice product.</li>
            <li>To me it isn&#x27;t that good it smells so strong</li>
            <li>With this price, what&#x27;s not to love?! :)</li>

            <li>Make ur lips smooth and it smells good</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I needed to own this cute packaging.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent that is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>The scrub itself is lotiony and the grain is very fine.</li>
            <li>Love the container  and scrub works great very Genta and effective</li>
            <li>and I was looking super forward to the product since there were so so much good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>so it would keep the product safe</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with it</li>
            <li>the container is fantastic!</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love the cute packaging.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LIP SCRUB.</li>
            <li>The two stars are for the cute packaging.</li>
            <li>This leaves my lips so smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell and texture of this lip cleanser.</li>
            <li>The longer you use it the better my lips seem to be getting.</li>
            <li>Love TonyMoly produts.  </li>
            <li>Want to love it</li>
            <li>Just need to add more scrub and flavor the lotion</li>
            <li>oh and the packaging is super cute!</li>
            <li>Anyways, I emptied it out and made my own scrub with sugar and olive oil because the packaging really is so darn cute!</li>
            <li>I like this lip scrub just fine.</li>
            <li>I like to scrub after washing my face, and before applying lip plumper, it makes a HUGE difference in texture, and helps emphasize the shape of your lips.</li>
            <li>the lips for a smooth application of lipstick.</li>
            <li>Soo smooth</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson and I&#x27;m actually happy you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot because it&#x27;s not a very big jar</li>
            <li>I feel like this is not a scrub but just a cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>It arrived sooner than expected my sister was delighted to use it once again :)</li>
            <li>See, I used many lip scrubs in the past and was happy with them.</li>
            <li>but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>The scrub has a slight strawberry scent , which is very nice.</li>
            <li>to me, this doesn&#x27;t have enough texture to really be effective.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and the container is super silly and cute!</li>
            <li>It is a lower priced lip scrub than the others and works just as great, if not better.</li>
            <li>or perhaps just use this scrub but use it with something more abrasive- like a soft scrub cloth or gentle toothbrush</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this lip scrub because it really moisturizes and makes my lips feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning before applying lipstick and lip gloss, so my lips are smooth an soft!</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute, but very tiny.</li>
            <li>the package is quite cute, when you open it you&#x27;ll find another lid</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was first unsure about this lip scrub, but I have to say that I really like this lip scrub.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake at first by applying too much and it took a while to get it all scrubbed in</li>
            <li>its a good product and is good for a daily care for your llips, but if your like me and looking for something that will really help you with dry dead skin on your lips, then you need something stronger.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use it for very long to get results, just a fast way to smooth the lips!</li>
            <li>A little really does go a long way, and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>thanks beautynetkorea</li>
            <li>An absolute must have.</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>The shipment was really fast and none of the items ive ordered were damaged.</li>
            <li>Not as intense a scrub as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>Buffs off all the dead skin cells but the perfect lips feeling does not last too too long .</li>
            <li>This is a good thing to have especially if you like to wear matte and dark lipsticks.</li>
            <li>you need to do is put a little amount on your lips, up and down, and rub it Gently for a minute or two until the whiteness of the scrub goes away, then wash it away with either warm water or a towel with warm water and rub whatever is left on your lips,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>I generally love this lip scrub, but the particles are a little too smooch for my liking.</li>
            <li>leave your lips soft and moisturized, but if you want, you can apply lip balm or anything in that sort to keep them really moisturized.</li>
            <li>Plain scrub lotion in a cool package, wasn&#x27;t juicy or fun.</li>
            <li>I have dry cracked lips constantly and I needed something that I could carry with me and this adorable lip scrub is just that.</li>
            <li>but this one is really smooth and it does really exfoliate and removes the dead</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and my lips stay very soft.</li>
            <li>self is so smooth unlike the ones you&#x27;d find in lush, the ones in lush are kinda rough</li>
            <li>It makes your lips instantly soft after applying and it does plump them a bit!</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that it smells like soap but other than that i really love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes me lips feel so smooth afterwards and a little tingly</li>
            <li>WILL LOOK SO MUCH SOFT AND PLUMP.</li>
            <li>It was too light on my lips, it did not get any dead skin off.</li>
            <li>I think this worked alright, gives you the same result as gently brushing over your lips with a damp toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It really soften your lip instantly</li>
            <li>It will make your lips soft and brighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as harsh on my lips and leaves it feeling supple, smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>Use Lush sugar scrub on lips.</li>
            <li>Also, although I kept the plastic seal on inside, it tends to dry up very fast.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, it wasnt even half full.</li>
            <li>Package is cute and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It works and makes your lips feeling really soft after scrubbing a tiny amount (about a dime sized amount!) between your lips.</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper even with shipping than other lip scrubs.</li>
            <li>it is gentle enough to use ever other day if need be.</li>
            <li>In New York, we had a rough winter</li>
            <li>and wow does it get rid of dry flakey lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sugar scrubs, regular scrubs, chapsticks of all kinds, but nothing can get me soft lips and have it stay moisturized for long.</li>
            <li>Its a light cream base with fine scrub particles throughout.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a bad chapstick that doesn&#x27;t even taste good.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sugar scrubs, regular scrubs, chapsticks of all kinds, but nothing can get me soft lips and have it stay moisturized for long.</li>
            <li> Its a light cream base with fine scrub particles throughout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a bad chapstick that doesn&#x27;t even taste good.</li>
            <li> First off, the product is very small, however, you do not need a lot of product anyway since this is only for your lips.</li>
            <li> Second, the consistency is very strange.</li>
            <li> Nivea cherry is the only moisturizing chapstick I use, however I still get flakes of dry skin-</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the little dry layers off my lips and gives it feeling nourished and soft!</li>
            <li> This product sucks and doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of exfoliation or moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This gets rid of those unsightly cracked, dry skin bits!</li>
            <li> I tried it with wet, damp, and dry lips.</li>
            <li> Almost like putting lotion on your lips (really white) with a little bit of grit to it.</li>
            <li> but, like I said, there&#x27;s not much there.</li>
            <li> As expected, I received the lip scrub timely.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what i expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a very small container but still has enough in there to last</li>
            <li> However, they all had small sugar-like (and some actual sugar) particles to actually scrub/exfoliate the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Just received this lip scrub today and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have to use it a few times for it to actually scrub off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Took product way too long to ship - 5 days past what Amazon said it would.</li>
            <li> and it is such a thick formula</li>
            <li> but what&#x27;s more annoying is that the description makes you think the conditioning balm comes with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but hate the taste.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a very small amount because it does cover everything you need it to.</li>
            <li> This stuff was odd..</li>
            <li> You rub it on your lips to remove the dead skin cells</li>
            <li> Smells like plain lotion with crumbs in it.</li>
            <li> This little lip scrub from Tonymoly is a must have!</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This one has small beads but does not exfoliate.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to get out of the container, almost like it&#x27;s cemented in there.</li>

            <li> Works really well. Package is cute and a little goes a long way. I use it twice a week and my lips stay very soft.</li>
            <li> This product sucks and doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of exfoliation or moisturizing.  Learned my lesson on buying beauty products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Took product way too long to ship - 5 days past what Amazon said it would. When I opened it, it wasnt even half full. The packaging is cute, but very tiny. There&#x27;s maybe enough in it for 3 or 4 uses. It works alright but, like I said, there&#x27;s not much there. And it&#x27;s hard to get out of the container, almost like it&#x27;s cemented in there. I would not by again.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning. Its a light cream base with fine scrub particles throughout. You rub it on your lips to remove the dead skin cells a prep the lips for a smooth application of lipstick. It smells pleasant and the container is super silly and cute!</li>
            <li> As expected, I received the lip scrub timely.  Best lip scrub ever!</li>
            <li> thanks beautynetkorea</li>
            <li> This lip scrub is AMAZING. An absolute must have. I like to scrub after washing my face, and before applying lip plumper, it makes a HUGE difference in texture, and helps emphasize the shape of your lips. FIVE STARS.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCTS. USED EVERY DAY AND YOUR LIPS WILL LOOK SO MUCH SOFT AND PLUMP. I LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> Really good product! A little really does go a long way, and it smells good! Don&#x27;t have to use it for very long to get results, just a fast way to smooth the lips!</li>
            <li> the package is quite cute, when you open it you&#x27;ll find another lid so it would keep the product safe and so it won&#x27;t spill so you don&#x27;t need to worry.&lt;br /&gt;it has a faint smell, something like peaches? not sure but it&#x27;s really pleasant&lt;br /&gt;the lip scrub it self is so smooth unlike the ones you&#x27;d find in lush, the ones in lush are kinda rough but this one is really smooth and it does really exfoliate and removes the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;all you need to do is put a little amount on your lips, up and down, and rub it Gently for a minute or two until the whiteness of the scrub goes away, then wash it away with either warm water or a towel with warm water and rub whatever is left on your lips,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll leave your lips soft and moisturized, but if you want, you can apply lip balm or anything in that sort to keep them really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I found the product to taste like lotion and to smell like lotion. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work and I was looking super forward to the product since there were so so much good reviews on it. To me it isn&#x27;t that good it smells so strong and it reminds me of lotion and tastes like it. No I&#x27;m not eating it but when I wanted to lick my lips to keep them moist I just tasted soap(lotion) and it is such a thick formula I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with it :/ I wouldn&#x27;t buy IG honestly</li>
            <li> The texture was awful, the scent was not great. Lush has the best lip scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This little lip scrub from Tonymoly is a must have! I use this every morning before applying lipstick and lip gloss, so my lips are smooth an soft! This is a good thing to have especially if you like to wear matte and dark lipsticks. This gets rid of those unsightly cracked, dry skin bits! Also this moisturizes and nourishes your lips with Jojoba oil, &amp; macadamia nut oil. It helps your lip color last longer, and protects from the sun. Lastly, this scrub will plump your pout! With this price, what&#x27;s not to love?! :)</li>
            <li> I was first unsure about this lip scrub, but I have to say that I really like this lip scrub. It works and makes your lips feeling really soft after scrubbing a tiny amount (about a dime sized amount!) between your lips. Thanks for making a great product as always TonyMoly!! (:</li>
            <li> Make ur lips smooth and it smells good</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what i expected. Smells like plain lotion with crumbs in it. Plain scrub lotion in a cool package, wasn&#x27;t juicy or fun.</li>
            <li> The things you learn on Amazon.  My lips feel beautiful and smooth after scrub.  I would order this product again</li>
            <li> The scrub has a slight strawberry scent , which is very nice. It makes your lips instantly soft after applying and it does plump them a bit! Very cute product but a bit pricey .</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected my sister was delighted to use it once again :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the container  and scrub works great very Genta and effective</li>
            <li> This is the cutest packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen! However, this scrub caused me to break out all around my mouth, which has never happened before to me. I didn&#x27;t like the scrub. It was too light on my lips, it did not get any dead skin off. Anyways, I emptied it out and made my own scrub with sugar and olive oil because the packaging really is so darn cute! You can keep it and refill it!</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper even with shipping than other lip scrubs. i like this - it is not too abrasive but it is effective. it is gentle enough to use ever other day if need be. the container is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think this worked alright, gives you the same result as gently brushing over your lips with a damp toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My lips Soo smooth i love it</li>
            <li> This stuff was odd.. Almost like putting lotion on your lips (really white) with a little bit of grit to it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Nice lip scrub, I love the packaging!</li>
            <li> to me, this doesn&#x27;t have enough texture to really be effective. its a good product and is good for a daily care for your llips, but if your like me and looking for something that will really help you with dry dead skin on your lips, then you need something stronger. or perhaps just use this scrub but use it with something more abrasive- like a soft scrub cloth or gentle toothbrush</li>
            <li> I initially bought this since my lips are peeling from being sick. I love the cute packaging. The scrub itself is lotiony and the grain is very fine. It feels like you just have lotion slathered on your lips. I have to use it a few times for it to actually scrub off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LIP SCRUB. It was exactly what I was looking for. I have dry cracked lips constantly and I needed something that I could carry with me and this adorable lip scrub is just that. The packaging is so very cute and the lid stays on nicely even in my bag. It makes me lips feel so smooth afterwards and a little tingly but that goes away quickly. It has a nice fresh scent that is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger. You only need to apply a very small amount because it does cover everything you need it to. I made the mistake at first by applying too much and it took a while to get it all scrubbed in and I had to wipe the extra off. I learned my lesson and I&#x27;m actually happy you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot because it&#x27;s not a very big jar so it will actually last longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how this could considered a lip scrub. It&#x27;s basically a bad chapstick that doesn&#x27;t even taste good. Does not exfoliate lips at all. The two stars are for the cute packaging. Would be good for a child or something.</li>
            <li> It really soften your lip instantly</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!! It will make your lips soft and brighter. It works just as it claimed.</li>
            <li> This leaves my lips so smooth and hydrated! I will definitely purchase this again...oh and the packaging is super cute!</li>
            <li> I generally love this lip scrub, but the particles are a little too smooch for my liking. I think I will go back to the sugar scrub. But still a nice product. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell and texture of this lip cleanser. It&#x27;s not as harsh on my lips and leaves it feeling supple, smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> Wish it was in an even bigger container! Just received this lip scrub today and a little goes a long way! Gets rid of the little dry layers off my lips and gives it feeling nourished and soft! I&#x27;ve tried sugar scrubs, regular scrubs, chapsticks of all kinds, but nothing can get me soft lips and have it stay moisturized for long. Nivea cherry is the only moisturizing chapstick I use, however I still get flakes of dry skin-but because of this lip scrub, I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore! I bought this to use for the harsh cold winter days but I&#x27;m thinking of ordering more because I&#x27;m going to probably use this every day! The shipment was really fast and none of the items ive ordered were damaged. It&#x27;s truly a product you need in your lip care regime!</li>
            <li> Makes my lips feel soft and smooth. Buffs off all the dead skin cells but the perfect lips feeling does not last too too long . I recomend this product but suggest using it when you plan on using lip tints not thinking it will make your lips perfect all the time . It does help though . The longer you use it the better my lips seem to be getting.</li>
            <li> I had just tried this today and wow does it get rid of dry flakey lips. It&#x27;s in a very small container but still has enough in there to last and you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot.The only flaw is that it smells like soap but other than that i really love this product.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this brand my accident and had never heard of it before. I decided to give it a try because I had run out of lip scrub. I am glad I purchased this lip scrub because it really moisturizes and makes my lips feel really soft. It is a lower priced lip scrub than the others and works just as great, if not better.</li>
            <li> In New York, we had a rough winter so I needed a lip scrub to get rid of these chapped lips. Not to mention that I needed to own this cute packaging. First off, the product is very small, however, you do not need a lot of product anyway since this is only for your lips. Second, the consistency is very strange. See, I used many lip scrubs in the past and was happy with them. However, they all had small sugar-like (and some actual sugar) particles to actually scrub/exfoliate the dead skin. This one has small beads but does not exfoliate. It is basically a lotion that is mixed with dots that does nothing. I tried it with wet, damp, and dry lips. Always the same result. I just massage my lips for 5 minutes with this product and rinse while wiping but no change. Also, although I kept the plastic seal on inside, it tends to dry up very fast. I feel like this is not a scrub but just a cheap lotion. I do not recommend unless you just want to stare at the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this! What would my lips be without it, simply moisturized your lips without the harshness, will repurchase</li>
            <li> I like this lip scrub just fine. Not as intense a scrub as I&#x27;d like but what&#x27;s more annoying is that the description makes you think the conditioning balm comes with it. It doesn&#x27;t. You only get a tiny bit of creamy scrub. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love TonyMoly produts.  Use Lush sugar scrub on lips. It&#x27;s ok but hate the taste. TonyMolys has some sort of scrub mixed with a lotion to scrub your lips. Want to love it but it just does not exfoliate well. The taste is horrible as well. It&#x27;s ashamed because the idea of a lip scrub with a softening lotion is great. It does soften your lips. Just need to add more scrub and flavor the lotion so it&#x27;s palatable</li>
