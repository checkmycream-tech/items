            <li> The color should have been deep yellow vs the one i received - clear!</li>
            <li> I am writing to let all the customers know that The seller is not loyal and do not order the product because You will have a lot of problems.</li>
            <li> i felt amazon users should know not to deal with them , you will  loose money since the keratin is expensive and they refuse to replace or refund us .bottom line they not worth using</li>
            <li> .it was too watery ,we applied it on the client and the result was basically a waist of few hours of hard work using a defected product.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> Too late to return, what a waste of money - it doesn&#x27;t do anything to the hair.</li>
            <li> I let them know it&#x27;s the wrong product, they said this is what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet.  </li>
            <li> ever i tried to use this place and was extremely disappointed ,once i tried using the keratin on a client  </li>

            <li> Great product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> best keratine ever- the best results! i recomend</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price.  I have not been disappointed yet.  The item arrived quickly and I already know it&#x27;s the best product out there so far.</li>
            <li> Happy with the products and prices were good, better first time, but less then my distribution</li>
            <li> I ordered the keratin treatment , they send me for blond hair. I let them know it&#x27;s the wrong product, they said this is what I ordered. After I talked to Amazon customer service, they responded to me  to ship the product and paying out of my pocket for the shipping! I didn&#x27;t agree, so I argue with them. Then the seller e-mailed me that FedEx will come to my home and pick up the product and they came, but FedEx didnt give me any document. Now the seller is telling my credit card that he didnt receive the product and I will get charge. FedEx told me on the phone that the product is shipped to Florida and the name of the person is Scott Greaver who got the product. I am not going to give up and I am not going to pay the money for the product when I was loyal and I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;  I am writing to let all the customers know that The seller is not loyal and do not order the product because You will have a lot of problems. I am very dissapointed I need to go through this! I will never order..</li>
            <li> i was excited to have an amazon access to keratin since we use it a lot in my salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how ever i tried to use this place and was extremely disappointed ,once i tried using the keratin on a client  my co worker and i felt something was off with the consistency of the keratin .it was too watery ,we applied it on the client and the result was basically a waist of few hours of hard work using a defected product.&lt;br /&gt;i can understand that part it could happened but after contacting this company and being ignored by them  and they refuse  taking any responsibility for there product  i felt amazon users should know not to deal with them , you will  loose money since the keratin is expensive and they refuse to replace or refund us .bottom line they not worth using</li>

            <li> It was old, with expired date. The color should have been deep yellow vs the one i received - clear! Too late to return, what a waste of money - it doesn&#x27;t do anything to the hair. When I bring the bottle to my hairdresser and compaire with her bottle - day and night difference. Very disapointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and it seems to work well.  The smell is much better than the last procure I used.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff!! I had never been able to find anything to make my hair look health.. Intil I found keratin smoothing treatment. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> It is the correct product name but in the description of the product I ordered the kertain tretament I wanted was for for blonde hair. Instead I just received the kertain treatment. If I knew this when I ordered the product, I would have gotten it through another company.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My mother loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product and was shipped fasted.</li>
