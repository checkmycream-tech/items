            <li> It didn&#x27;t come as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> The description said that I would get a large, medium and small bun maker, however I was sent 3 of the same size.</li>
            <li> Also, the product contained 1 large, 1 med, 1 small</li>
            <li> But their small is quite large and could be median size.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my hair to get long enough so that I can use this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no more mess on my head, less than 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time trying to cover the whole entire bun with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the order messed up and gave me all the same size or not.  </li>
            <li> Also the size  variations are too close to each other .</li>
            <li> The buns were too small.</li>
            <li> Pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and too stiff!</li>
            <li> Just wish they wouldnt stick price tags through them because they are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> too thick cant use it</li>
