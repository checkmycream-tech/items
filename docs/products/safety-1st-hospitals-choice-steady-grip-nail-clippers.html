            <li>so this looked good.  </li>
            <li>You NEED a good pair of clippers trust me.</li>
            <li>But its a very cute item.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I love how bulky they are!</li>
            <li>But these were nice in the beginning...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to handle with a nice grip.</li>
            <li>just add them to another order you are already placing because you&#x27;ll be so glad you did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This illuminates his nails perfectly and makes it so simple.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great buy!!</li>
            <li>I never was able to make even one cut</li>
            <li>w/ magnifying glass is a lot better for smoothing the nail while clipping it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic nail clipper!</li>
            <li>Neither of us has any problem making sure that we don&#x27;t have my baby&#x27;s finger along with her nail.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for tiny nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(This method worked even better while I was still breastfeeding, because it gave us more time.</li>
            <li>I need to purchase more</li>
            <li>You can really get a good grip on them while you&#x27;re going to work on your child&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and remove some of the intimidation factor of clipping baby&#x27;s claws.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to handle and hold.</li>
            <li>These are the ones to buy - easy to grip and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>But with these clippers, it made my job easy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to grip, for me or my husband.</li>
            <li>very useful n easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>These are the best nail clippers for my little one.</li>
            <li>Even in the daylight the extra light still is great to have.  </li>
            <li>I got it under free shipping and sale price.</li>
            <li>This model fit well in the hand.</li>
            <li>Also - we like that these aren&#x27;t smooth</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and snip quickly and accurately, even with a wiggly toddler.</li>
            <li>The bulb-shape of the handle make them very easy to hold and use and this will be VERY important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first years nail clipper much better</li>
            <li>The handle needs to have a much wider channel for the top part to fit in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps what we have experienced is limited to the unit that we have received.</li>
            <li>However, I think it&#x27;s a good value and will be replacing them with another of the same model.</li>
            <li>The light works soooooooo well and is by far the most helpful thing.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li>On a whim (after reading customer reviews on Amazon), I purchased a pair of these right before our daughter was born.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, both pairs were cheap enough that they have been donated to Goodwill.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp, but the part of the handle that you press down on in order to actually clip gets caught on the rest of the handle if it isn&#x27;t lined up absolutely perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers worked great for awhile, but then the metal part became dull.</li>
            <li>I think the First Years clippers</li>
            <li>(This is what I did the first time I cut my daughter&#x27;s nails.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh and these are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>After losing some dexterity in my right hand fingers, I searched for fingernail clippers that were large enough to easily use.  </li>
            <li>They were sharper and worked better in the long run.</li>
            <li>a side note, I purchased a pair for $0.97 from a large retail-chain store that said they were the Safety 1st Hostpital&#x27;s Choice nail clippers</li>
            <li>you dont realize you need lots of light to see the fine little line between nail and skin.  </li>
            <li>I went back and reviewed my research and could not find anywhere an adequate discription of the product!  </li>
            <li>This pin does not stay in very well.  </li>
            <li>It always make me very nervious</li>
            <li>We received about three or four different nail clippers as gifts and I had them stored all over the house and in diaper bags so we always had them readily available.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>The rubber grip really is \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>the thick shape of the body helps me feel more secure during nail clipping sessions.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use for adult hands, most others are small to use.</li>
            <li>In a pamphlet from the Hartford Company, I found a listing for Steady Grip Nail Clippers.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone with a baby or who will be having a baby.  </li>
            <li>The grip makes you feel confident while clipping your little one&#x27;s nails.   </li>
            <li>These are MUCH better quality than the $0.97 ones - the blade on these is thin, crisp and sharp, the blue surfaces are a rubbery non-skid material and they fit SOOO much better in my adult hands!</li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with these clippers, they are sharp, cut nicely and fit securely in your hand.  </li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t really cut completely through the nail.  </li>
            <li>As a first time mom, I was really scared to cut my son&#x27;s tiny nails.</li>
            <li>I have purchased for all the new moms I know.</li>
            <li>We all know its near impossible to clip a babys finger nails while they are awake, so these are perfect for when baby is sleeping and room is dim.  </li>
            <li>I found that, unlike the way most clippers are designed, these have a small metal pin that holds the lever in place.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a first time parent and I have been told THESE Safety 1st Hospital&#x27;s Choice clippers are the nail clippers you want by several mothers.</li>
            <li>These are the first, and only, nail clippers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>far, it works well.</li>
            <li>They will weaken it, but then you have to pull the nail off with your fingers to get it completely off.  </li>
            <li>Been using this nail clipper since my son was 3 months old, he is now 3 years old.</li>
            <li>Also i feel like its too big to really get in there.</li>
            <li>I remember thinking the light was probably some extra thing that wasnt going to do anything, but they were thick and sturdy and seemed more well made than the other nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work fine, the only problem for me is that they leave the nail edge a bit jagged and very, very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low and finally found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s nails were completely transparent, and way too soft once they were wet.</li>

            <li> My baby&#x27;s nails were completely transparent, and way too soft once they were wet.</li>
            <li> I ended up just switching to adult clippers that cost less at the drug store to clip my kids&#x27; nails.</li>
            <li> I have only used them a few times and found the pin had slipped almost completely out.  </li>
            <li> so I know it will not stay together very long.</li>
            <li> The clippers were way too small for adult use.  </li>
            <li> but they are VERY different in appearance and have a small, flatish, tear-drop shaped white bulb that is 1/4 of the size of this one.</li>
            <li> After about a year of use, the lever lost its strength - I had to press harder and harder to get it to clip.</li>
            <li> and she said they were the right name but the wrong clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers came pre-packaged with other baby safety items.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this problem with other clippers I&#x27;ve used, just these.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that when you&#x27;re trying to deal with tiny wiggly little fingers, it&#x27;s hard to keep this part from swiveling slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> I call them claws because they&#x27;re so sharp!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very sharp</li>
            <li> They are very tiny, which I know is because babies have small fingernails, but because they are so small, I have to cut each nail twice; once on each side.  </li>
            <li> The blades appear to be dull even when brand-new, and there is very little leverage produced on the clipping lever to make the necessary clips, even pushed all the way down against the plastic shell.</li>
            <li> When they were received, I was very disappointed to discover that I spent so much time to purchase clippers to be used with infants!!!  </li>
            <li> These make a tough job a little easier.</li>
            <li> If you have ever cut a baby&#x27;s nails before, you know how hard it is to line up the clippers just once, not to mention twice.  </li>
            <li> The problem is it&#x27;s very small and hard to see my baby&#x27;s finger nail.  </li>
            <li> The worst is when you get a nail clipper that isnt sharp enough to cut fingernails</li>
            <li> Until you are cutting a little ones nails</li>
            <li> I hate using this product to cut my infants nails the blade, it is too sharp!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, these clippers clip so poorly that they are actually dangerous to use on a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This meant being unable to see or feel baby&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> Even when he moves around while cutting his nails, I haven&#x27;t cut him.</li>
            <li> (so our fingers don&#x27;t slip off while we&#x27;re cutting her nails).</li>
            <li> If these had been expensive, I would have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> We have had a very disappointing experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Either way, we are very disappointed in what we have purchased.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible idea!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are easy to use and remove some of the intimidation factor of clipping baby&#x27;s claws.  I call them claws because they&#x27;re so sharp!</li>
            <li> it is easy to handle and hold. Just need to be sharper.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it works well.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the way these cut.  I found that, unlike the way most clippers are designed, these have a small metal pin that holds the lever in place.  This pin does not stay in very well.  I have only used them a few times and found the pin had slipped almost completely out.  Even when I pushed it back in it slid in with no effort so I know it will not stay together very long.</li>
            <li> These are the ones to buy - easy to grip and ergonomic. Not slippery like the all metal ones. I have purchased for all the new moms I know. These make a tough job a little easier.</li>
            <li> I couldnt understand why this nail cutter would take 2-3 weeks to ship. Still dont know. Also thought it would come in white and blue, but it arrived in Orange.   But its a very cute item. The grip makes you feel confident while clipping your little one&#x27;s nails.   I got it under free shipping and sale price. So no complains.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these nail clippers - just add them to another order you are already placing because you&#x27;ll be so glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a first time parent and I have been told THESE Safety 1st Hospital&#x27;s Choice clippers are the nail clippers you want by several mothers. The bulb-shape of the handle make them very easy to hold and use and this will be VERY important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I purchased a pair for $0.97 from a large retail-chain store that said they were the Safety 1st Hostpital&#x27;s Choice nail clippers but they are VERY different in appearance and have a small, flatish, tear-drop shaped white bulb that is 1/4 of the size of this one. I showed them to a girlfriend and she said they were the right name but the wrong clippers. When I saw these on Amazon I ordered 2 pairs (my friends swear these disappear) and I am so glad that I did! These are MUCH better quality than the $0.97 ones - the blade on these is thin, crisp and sharp, the blue surfaces are a rubbery non-skid material and they fit SOOO much better in my adult hands!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with these clippers, they are sharp, cut nicely and fit securely in your hand.  But I wish I had purchased the ones with the attached magnifying glass. Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> These clippers came pre-packaged with other baby safety items.  They are very tiny, which I know is because babies have small fingernails, but because they are so small, I have to cut each nail twice; once on each side.  If you have ever cut a baby&#x27;s nails before, you know how hard it is to line up the clippers just once, not to mention twice.  They also don&#x27;t really cut completely through the nail.  They will weaken it, but then you have to pull the nail off with your fingers to get it completely off.  Because of this, there are a lot of jagged edges left that can scratch up my baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I bought these before I had my son in December.  I remember thinking the light was probably some extra thing that wasnt going to do anything, but they were thick and sturdy and seemed more well made than the other nail clippers.  The worst is when you get a nail clipper that isnt sharp enough to cut fingernails so this looked good.  Well it has been 4 moths later and this has exceeded my expectations.  We all know its near impossible to clip a babys finger nails while they are awake, so these are perfect for when baby is sleeping and room is dim.  Even in the daylight the extra light still is great to have.  The light works soooooooo well and is by far the most helpful thing.  Until you are cutting a little ones nails you dont realize you need lots of light to see the fine little line between nail and skin.  This illuminates his nails perfectly and makes it so simple.  I would highly recommend these to anyone with a baby or who will be having a baby.  You NEED a good pair of clippers trust me. Oh and these are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> As a first time mom, I was really scared to cut my son&#x27;s tiny nails. But with these clippers, it made my job easy. I love how bulky they are! You can really get a good grip on them while you&#x27;re going to work on your child&#x27;s nails. I am buying my second pair and a pair for my 3 of my friends who are expecting. Overall, great buy!!</li>
            <li> I got a pair of these in a set when I had my daughter 2 years ago, and we purchased these as a replacement when we lost them recently. They&#x27;re easy to use and snip quickly and accurately, even with a wiggly toddler.</li>
            <li> We have had a very disappointing experience with this product. It just does not perform well. The blades appear to be dull even when brand-new, and there is very little leverage produced on the clipping lever to make the necessary clips, even pushed all the way down against the plastic shell. In fact, these clippers clip so poorly that they are actually dangerous to use on a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps what we have experienced is limited to the unit that we have received. Either way, we are very disappointed in what we have purchased.</li>
            <li> My problem with these clippers is that the jaws don&#x27;t open widely enough for me to get the nail in place quickly enough.  By the time you get them lined up, any movement of the nail to be cut leaves you clipping air.  I never was able to make even one cut so they are now in a drawer.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job. However, it&#x27;s very sharp and I cut my baby&#x27;s finger twice. The problem is it&#x27;s very small and hard to see my baby&#x27;s finger nail.  It always make me very nervious everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all!  They are nice and sharp, but the part of the handle that you press down on in order to actually clip gets caught on the rest of the handle if it isn&#x27;t lined up absolutely perfectly.  The problem is that when you&#x27;re trying to deal with tiny wiggly little fingers, it&#x27;s hard to keep this part from swiveling slightly off center.  You try to clip, and it gets stuck yet again.  They&#x27;re a pain to use.  The handle needs to have a much wider channel for the top part to fit in.</li>
            <li> These clippers work fine, the only problem for me is that they leave the nail edge a bit jagged and very, very sharp.  I don&#x27;t have this problem with other clippers I&#x27;ve used, just these.  My baby winds up scratching herself and me.  I think the First Years clippers w/ magnifying glass is a lot better for smoothing the nail while clipping it.</li>
            <li> very useful n easy to hold.  have been using this on my baby and its perfect</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic nail clipper! Been using this nail clipper since my son was 3 months old, he is now 3 years old. Even when he moves around while cutting his nails, I haven&#x27;t cut him. It is easy to hold and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers for my little one. I searched high and low and finally found them on Amazon. They&#x27;re easy to handle with a nice grip.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers worked great for awhile, but then the metal part became dull. I ended up just switching to adult clippers that cost less at the drug store to clip my kids&#x27; nails. They were sharper and worked better in the long run. But these were nice in the beginning...</li>
            <li> After losing some dexterity in my right hand fingers, I searched for fingernail clippers that were large enough to easily use.  In a pamphlet from the Hartford Company, I found a listing for Steady Grip Nail Clippers.  After searching on Amazon, I ordered a two-pair set.  When they were received, I was very disappointed to discover that I spent so much time to purchase clippers to be used with infants!!!  The clippers were way too small for adult use.  I went back and reviewed my research and could not find anywhere an adequate discription of the product!  Fortunately, both pairs were cheap enough that they have been donated to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> This model fit well in the hand. It was my go-to set of clippers out of 3 that I had received. After about a year of use, the lever lost its strength - I had to press harder and harder to get it to clip. It seemed that the materials had somehow softened over time. If these had been expensive, I would have been disappointed. However, I think it&#x27;s a good value and will be replacing them with another of the same model.</li>
            <li> These are the first, and only, nail clippers that I have tried. They are easy to grip, for me or my husband. Neither of us has any problem making sure that we don&#x27;t have my baby&#x27;s finger along with her nail. These are the perfect size for tiny nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having issues, take these with you to your child&#x27;s next check up. Your child&#x27;s pediatrician should not have any problem helping you out. (This is what I did the first time I cut my daughter&#x27;s nails.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother recommended clipping my daughter&#x27;s nails in the bath. This was a terrible idea! My baby&#x27;s nails were completely transparent, and way too soft once they were wet. This meant being unable to see or feel baby&#x27;s nails. The one and only time I nicked my daughter was when I tried this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We, now, only clip my daughter&#x27;s nails while she is drinking her bottle. This ensures she won&#x27;t squirm, because she is preoccupied. (This method worked even better while I was still breastfeeding, because it gave us more time. I&#x27;d just have my husband clip her nails while she was eating.)</li>
            <li> We received about three or four different nail clippers as gifts and I had them stored all over the house and in diaper bags so we always had them readily available. On a whim (after reading customer reviews on Amazon), I purchased a pair of these right before our daughter was born. They have become our &#x27;go-to&#x27; pair of clippers. I need to purchase more so my husband and I aren&#x27;t always asking where we placed them last! They are really easy to use for adult hands, most others are small to use. Also - we like that these aren&#x27;t smooth (so our fingers don&#x27;t slip off while we&#x27;re cutting her nails). It has a coating to keep your fingers and hand in place. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> The rubber grip really is \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; and the thick shape of the body helps me feel more secure during nail clipping sessions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have another pair of baby nail clippers by another company (I forget which one) and I never use it because they are inferior to these clippers.</li>
            <li> I hate using this product to cut my infants nails the blade, it is too sharp!!  Also i feel like its too big to really get in there. II like the whit first years nail clipper much better</li>
