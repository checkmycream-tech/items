            <li>I am fair skinned and the color is just about perfect.</li>
            <li>It blends beautifully and wears well.  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that because the concealer in this brand is amazing and perfectly matches my skin.</li>

            <li>Amazon.com is where I shop a great deal of the time.</li>

            <li>and it works just great.</li>
            <li>then that it goes on great.</li>
            <li>this make-up is really good for your skin, you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re even wearing this</li>
            <li>This product is sensational.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect foundation for me - the skin tone is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for - coverage and  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Smart Shade before and it turned out perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use the Light shade.</li>
            <li>The Cover Girl Advanced Radiance Age-Defying Cream is much better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 and have tried many foundations over the years.</li>
            <li>After one week, my skin looks better than it has for years.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light yet covers redness nicely.</li>
            <li>I do use a moisturizer because I find it goes on smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>i love the skin match technology .i</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I will probably end up buying it again unless I find something better.</li>
            <li>I was glad I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li>(I should also say that my complexion is pretty good</li>
            <li>I love this foundation -- it goes on so smooth and lovely</li>
            <li>It is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, which is important in a foundation.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin and have experienced no reaction at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light shade, and most of the stuff in the tube seemed to be orange colored.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>Love the makeup - just can&#x27;t figure out how it goes on looking like white cream and becomes a great shade on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>it is light weight but covers well .and</li>
            <li>Now if they could just figure out a way to cover up my extra chin, it would be great.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to apply and stays put until you take it off.</li>
            <li>so glad I did because this makeup is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and somehow adjusts itself from bright white to blend with my skintone.</li>
            <li>I 1st bought this because of a positive review by a lady whom I presume is around my age (more than 55).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product gives you a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>I love the natural look and it gives me  a light cover up.</li>
            <li>It goes on white like a creamy lotion and then turns miraculously to my own skintone.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product</li>
            <li>This makeup was great for the first few applications, but after a while, it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.  </li>
            <li>Light and sheer, applies and blends easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s horrid but great in small amounts.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many foundations, but this one I think I actually will keep using!</li>
            <li>It did a nice job of covering, but it wasn&#x27;t super heavy, which I like</li>
            <li>It was a friend who told me about how this one blends into a more natural look on various skin types and looks more natural.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it lives up to the hype</li>
            <li>The lightest shade was still very orange.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t give me as much coverage that I would like for the office I have been using it on the weekends.</li>
            <li>I have that cost 2-4 times as much.</li>
            <li>A too much &amp;</li>
            <li>BUT haha I have learned that once you put it on if you don&#x27;t blend immediatelyit is streaky XD OOPS</li>
            <li>I have light color skin with some red areas.</li>
            <li>really does color match.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t clean a smudge I left on the bottle and</li>
            <li>Then again, it is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve got foundation on in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li>or so I thought, apparently they sell both anti aging and regular and the second time I bought the regular one which does not have as good coverage.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to wear a light weight but good cover foundation and not have to suffer the awful &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; effect that I have had trouble with over the years with various foundations.  </li>
            <li>I had tried various types of make up and they just never looked right.</li>
            <li>Has a very natural look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Not bad enough though to bother sending it back.</li>
            <li>I have some wrinkles, scarring, a few blemishes, and uneven coloring, This makeup tones it all down a bit, but by no means leaves me anywhere near flawless.</li>
            <li>you have very dark acne scars, it will not conceal well because this is light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by this.</li>
            <li>It looks almost like a white moisturizer, but darn, you put it on, and it really does match your skin</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive too.  </li>
            <li>Not a shiny look, not matte, but a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to anyone who wanted full coverage, but it certainly evened out my skin tone and cover a few minor imperfections.</li>
            <li>None compare to this simple, inexpensive makeup that looks perfectly natural and truly matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird?</li>
            <li>would put this product up there  with more expensive products as far as quality .I</li>
            <li>I threw away all my other foundations that were just making my skin look older.</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need a heavy foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has become my everyday foundation over others</li>
            <li> am suuuuuper pale..</li>
            <li> like the fact that you squeez  the tube and the small opeining  allows little chance for bacteria</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, pale skin with slight rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; my wrinkles, at a certain age that is impossible, but it does not make them look worse as some other foundations do.</li>
            <li> Others were either thick and gloppy and I had to apply them like face spackle, or the stuff was thin and watery and served no purpose whatsoever other than to remind me not to waste money trying to hide under a beauty product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been hard to find something to match my skin, and unfortunately even the palest of this makeup doesn&#x27;t match my wonderbread white</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used any type of &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; makeup base</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> (I hate that.)</li>
            <li> i like this base.</li>

            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it lives up to the hype but it isn&#x27;t bad.  Goes on smoothly and I guess it has silicone in it because it leaves your skin silky looking but I didn&#x27;t see any color at all.  It just looked like my skin smoother.  Not bad enough though to bother sending it back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this foundation would make a difference in the texture and color of my skin.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, pale skin with slight rosacea.  This is the perfect foundation for me - the skin tone is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for - coverage and  \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look.  I&#x27;m throwing away my foundation I purchased in Japan - and replacing it with this product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The lightest shade was still very orange. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that because the concealer in this brand is amazing and perfectly matches my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and have tried many foundations over the years. Recent choices have been Philosophy, Origins, Maybelline, Sephora and Revlon. None compare to this simple, inexpensive makeup that looks perfectly natural and truly matches my skin tone. After one week, my skin looks better than it has for years. The coverage is light yet covers redness nicely. It can also be applied in another layer for medium coverage. No shine. No cakiness. Never orange or yellow. I have fair skin and use the Light shade. I also have extremely sensitive skin and have experienced no reaction at all. I do recommend checking the application after about ten minutes, in case it needs any extra blending, as the foundation goes on white and isn&#x27;t entirely visible for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Color was perfect match for my skin. Was wary about buying foundation online without being able to see the color, but it worked out. I like that it has sunscreen already in it. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, which is important in a foundation.</li>
            <li> This makeup was great for the first few applications, but after a while, it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.  I ordered the light shade, and most of the stuff in the tube seemed to be orange colored.</li>
            <li> Love the makeup - just can&#x27;t figure out how it goes on looking like white cream and becomes a great shade on the skin.  I also appreciate the lack of fragrance which sometime irritates my eyes when it gets too close.</li>
            <li> I just wonder why it changes color from grayish white to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and the color is just about perfect. I do use a moisturizer because I find it goes on smoother and more even.</li>
            <li> Would not wear any other makeup.  Delivery was great also</li>
            <li> This product is sensational. All the tiny lines are filled-in with this makeup. It goes on white like a creamy lotion and then turns miraculously to my own skintone. It&#x27;s like I am not wearing makeup at all. I suggest that all women try this product. I know you will like it. Amazon.com is where I shop a great deal of the time. I get great service, prompt delivery and extremely great prices.</li>
            <li> this make-up is really good for your skin, you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re even wearing this</li>

I let it thoroughly dry before I put on any blush or eyebrow pencil and it works just great.</li>
            <li> I 1st bought this because of a positive review by a lady whom I presume is around my age (more than 55).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did because this makeup is exactly what I need. Wish I&#x27;d known of it years ago. It will do wonders for your complexion - even if you&#x27;re not old like me !</li>
            <li> it is light weight but covers well .and i love the skin match technology .i would put this product up there  with more expensive products as far as quality .I like the fact that you squeez  the tube and the small opeining  allows little chance for bacteria</li>

I was really surprised by this. It looks almost like a white moisturizer, but darn, you put it on, and it really does match your skin color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use foundation all over; just forehead, nose, under eyes and chin. The match was seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen others say that this is almost like a tinted moisturizer. That&#x27;s not true. It did a nice job of covering, but it wasn&#x27;t super heavy, which I like (I should also say that my complexion is pretty good so I don&#x27;t need a heavy foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive enough that if you think you might benefit, you should try it. This definitely won&#x27;t up on the Island of Misfit Makeup!</li>
            <li> Did not like this makeup at all.  It did not cover well and was somewhat greasy. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Has a white finish. It&#x27;s kind of weird? The Cover Girl Advanced Radiance Age-Defying Cream is much better!</li>
            <li> I draw attention to this make up as being anti aging because I bought this and I liked it but I did not pay any attention to the fact that this was anti aging. So when I ran out I went and bought the same stuff... or so I thought, apparently they sell both anti aging and regular and the second time I bought the regular one which does not have as good coverage. I recommend the anti aging version over the regular version.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with this makeup. Coverage was sheerer than I had hoped for. Color was too dark as well.  I&#x27;ll stick with Revlon Colorstay.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used any type of &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; makeup base and I was pleasantly surprised. Even though it doesn&#x27;t give me as much coverage that I would like for the office I have been using it on the weekends. It is quick and easy to apply and stays put until you take it off. For the price go ahead give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have some wrinkles, scarring, a few blemishes, and uneven coloring, This makeup tones it all down a bit, but by no means leaves me anywhere near flawless. Then again, it is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve got foundation on in direct sunlight. (I hate that.) It has become my everyday foundation over others I have that cost 2-4 times as much. I will probably end up buying it again unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> A too much &amp; it&#x27;s horrid but great in small amounts.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product it is the perfect color and makes my skin feel great. BUT haha I have learned that once you put it on if you don&#x27;t blend immediatelyit is streaky XD OOPS but other then that it goes on great. And I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I love the natural look and it gives me  a light cover up. Not heavy and feels great on my face. I have light color skin with some red areas.My skin is sensitive too.  It works for me. ;)</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many foundations, but this one I think I actually will keep using! Others were either thick and gloppy and I had to apply them like face spackle, or the stuff was thin and watery and served no purpose whatsoever other than to remind me not to waste money trying to hide under a beauty product. It goes on smoothly and somehow adjusts itself from bright white to blend with my skintone. Now if they could just figure out a way to cover up my extra chin, it would be great. Get on that, will ya?</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to wear a light weight but good cover foundation and not have to suffer the awful &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; effect that I have had trouble with over the years with various foundations.  It blends beautifully and wears well.  I will be using this foundation for the foreseeable future.  Thank you Almay.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a nice natural look. Not a shiny look, not matte, but a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dark acne scars, it will not conceal well because this is light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I am suuuuuper pale.. It&#x27;s always been hard to find something to match my skin, and unfortunately even the palest of this makeup doesn&#x27;t match my wonderbread white skin.&lt;br /&gt;But it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Smart Shade before and it turned out perfectly. I decided to try this one because of the SPF and I&#x27;m getting older. It turned my skin ORANGE! I was glad I was able to get a refund. I didn&#x27;t clean a smudge I left on the bottle and that was orange.</li>
            <li> i like this base. really does color match. i don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup but i like coverage</li>
            <li> I love this foundation -- it goes on so smooth and lovely and I have yet for anyone to see a line along my jaw.  It blends spendidly.  Would not recommend to anyone who wanted full coverage, but it certainly evened out my skin tone and cover a few minor imperfections.</li>
