            <li>it works really well,  smells great and makes your skin feel AH MA ZING!</li>
            <li>This soap gives me a great sense of feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or layer on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Was therefore very pleased to have been able to find them online.</li>
            <li>Needs way more exfoliators to be effective in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, it gets my body clean and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>In fact,I haven&#x27;t been able to find any in quite some time now.</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>Have been looking for product with more Grit.</li>
            <li>im gonna get some more.</li>
            <li>These soaps are a good value and leave you smelling fresh and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>They tried to replace it with a bodywash version but its no where near as good.</li>
            <li>, it would just be significantly improved if grittier.</li>
            <li>water hardness may significantly affect your experience.  </li>
            <li>The product was close to what I was seeking but not what was originally made.</li>
            <li>As a regular soap, it smells good</li>
            <li>Is that good enough?</li>
            <li>Gets all those un wanted oils of your face and leaves a clean fresh smell from cleansing</li>
            <li>I love the scrubbing beads because it gives me that clean feeling since I only use soap without a sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why he wanted this particular soap, but he does always smell good, so</li>
            <li>It works somewhat for a man that works outdoors, not behind a desk.</li>
            <li>They are not as large as in many exfoliating products, so they won&#x27;t get stuck in your hair or make a mess</li>
            <li>A quick google search revealed that others had also reported that mosquitoes didn&#x27;t like Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the same.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I would love to see a scientific study on this, since of course, anecdotal evidence is hardly conclusive.</li>
            <li>I also use this soap because I developed a skin allergy to Formaldehyde which is not an ingredient in this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if ur a fan of Irish spring soap.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I ever buy because it&#x27;s usually the cheapest and works fine to me.  </li>
            <li>This specific kind with the microbeads are difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>first tried this soap a few years ago when I was living in Rwanda.  </li>
            <li>Second, it seems to have little bit of roughness in it to the really scrub your skin.  </li>

            <li> They have tiny little blue beads, which give the soap extra scrubiness.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the usual Irish Spring scent and the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; is nearly non-existant.</li>
            <li> The problem is that these pesky beads are going down the drain and ultimately into the environment.  </li>
            <li> Upon the suggestion of another heavily tattooed friend, he started scrubbing his back using this soap and a nylon washcloth.</li>
            <li> but this soap typically lasts longer than other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and he swears that those tats are the source of these weird back cysts he gets occasionally.  </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d been using it a few days, I noticed that I had stopped getting my usual 20</li>
            <li> No more funky bumps.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I go through a bar of soap in no more than 5 showers.  </li>
            <li> It includes approximately 1mm in diameter scrubbing balls.  </li>
            <li> Ive been stocking up because sadly this soap has been discontinued :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This specific kind with the microbeads are difficult to find in stores. In fact,I haven&#x27;t been able to find any in quite some time now. Was therefore very pleased to have been able to find them online. Highly recommend if ur a fan of Irish spring soap.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to as a gift has expressed satisfaction with the product, and delight at the amount I gave her. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Ive been stocking up because sadly this soap has been discontinued :( it works really well,  smells great and makes your skin feel AH MA ZING! They tried to replace it with a bodywash version but its no where near as good.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s entire back is covered with tattoos and he swears that those tats are the source of these weird back cysts he gets occasionally.  Upon the suggestion of another heavily tattooed friend, he started scrubbing his back using this soap and a nylon washcloth. No more funky bumps.</li>
            <li> Not sure why he wanted this particular soap, but he does always smell good, so there you go- I give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I could not find it in stores anymore.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the same.  The color is off, the smell is off and there is not the same bead consistency.  It almost seems like a counterfeit product.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as I had hoped! Needs way more exfoliators to be effective in my opinion. As a regular soap, it smells good and I like it, it would just be significantly improved if grittier.</li>
            <li> Dissapointing.  Doesn&#x27;t have the usual Irish Spring scent and the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; is nearly non-existant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Irish Spring.  I use this one in the shower.</li>
            <li> First, the scent is delightful.  Second, it seems to have little bit of roughness in it to the really scrub your skin.  We love it.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I love this bar soap!  It includes approximately 1mm in diameter scrubbing balls.  These remind me of the Lava soap product that I probably would prefer not using on all of my skin.  This soap gives me a great sense of feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or layer on my skin.  Bear in mind water hardness may significantly affect your experience.  I also use this soap because I developed a skin allergy to Formaldehyde which is not an ingredient in this product.  I haven&#x27;t found Formaldehyde in the Irish Spring family of bar soap products either but haven&#x27;t verified - as of May 2013.</li>
            <li> What am I supposed to say?  It is soap, it gets my body clean and it smells good.  Is that good enough?</li>
            <li> The product was close to what I was seeking but not what was originally made. Have been looking for product with more Grit. It works somewhat for a man that works outdoors, not behind a desk.</li>
            <li> These soaps are a good value and leave you smelling fresh and feeling clean.  They have tiny little blue beads, which give the soap extra scrubiness.  The problem is that these pesky beads are going down the drain and ultimately into the environment.  They are not as large as in many exfoliating products, so they won&#x27;t get stuck in your hair or make a mess otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this soap a few years ago when I was living in Rwanda.  After I&#x27;d been using it a few days, I noticed that I had stopped getting my usual 20+ mosquito bites per day.  A quick google search revealed that others had also reported that mosquitoes didn&#x27;t like Irish Spring.  For me, it seemed to vary by mosquito type, however, so YMMV.  Nevertheless, I would love to see a scientific study on this, since of course, anecdotal evidence is hardly conclusive.</li>
            <li> great soap im gonna get some more.</li>
