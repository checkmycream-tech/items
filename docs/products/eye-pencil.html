            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li>Very nice pencil.</li>
            <li>I love how you don&#x27;t have to use much, wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smoothly, the best pencil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good if you like a smudgey eye.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on what kind of eye lid you have.</li>
            <li>The color is good, but the pencil does not apply as smoothly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The Mineral Fusion Natural Eye Pencil is the best eye liner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily too!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it out since I LOVE the Mineral Fusion foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I really like the charcoal pencils, this one is great.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of mineral make up.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think you will love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>This product is natural and looks very nice on the eyes.</li>
            <li>This pencil is a beautiful shade and really I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>also find that it smears easily,</li>
            <li>easy to work with on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays on, and easy to get off.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>What can I say besides gluten free and that is very exciting to me.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and it stays on all day with primer.</li>
            <li>This is the first coal/brown that is more an ash shade.  </li>
            <li>Smudges and wares off quickly.</li>
            <li>This pencil is a great color, thank goodness for something besides black!  </li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Most colors of brown have red in it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I heard that it was better for your lashes and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad smudgy, but it&#x27;s not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Great eye pencil -- I&#x27;m extremely selective about makeup brands (ingredients really do matter) and almost unreasonably picky about the intensity of the pigment when it comes to black.</li>
            <li>It is very soft though and takes a steady hand</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t drag or skip across the skin, but instead leaves a solid line that, for the most part, stays in place.  </li>
            <li>I do use it, but it isn&#x27;t quite the same as some other products that I do love.  </li>
            <li>Dark black no mess easy to clean</li>
            <li>It looks so natural</li>
            <li>But I will be looking for something different in the future that hopefully stays vibrant and lasts longer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s such a nice product and doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>Soft pencil but not so soft like some brands that it just pushes the tip down immediately.</li>

            <li> (I actually just use this as my &#x27;base&#x27; and then use loose minerals with a flat or pointed brush to make a very dramatic 1940&#x27;s/60&#x27;s inspired line.)</li>

            <li> Soft pencil but not so soft like some brands that it just pushes the tip down immediately. Like their mascara too.</li>
            <li> This pencil is a beautiful shade and really I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice in my makeup bag.  I do use it, but it isn&#x27;t quite the same as some other products that I do love.  I wanted to try it out since I LOVE the Mineral Fusion foundation powder.</li>
            <li> very good eyeliner, doesn&#x27;t smudge a lot even thou I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly, the best pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is rich and it stays on all day with primer. It&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s such a nice product and doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients.</li>

            <li> Goes on great and doesn&#x27;t end up underneath the eye after hours of wear.</li>

            <li> Great eye pencil -- I&#x27;m extremely selective about makeup brands (ingredients really do matter) and almost unreasonably picky about the intensity of the pigment when it comes to black. I like it JET BLACK. With this product, my search is over. It doesn&#x27;t drag or skip across the skin, but instead leaves a solid line that, for the most part, stays in place.  (I actually just use this as my &#x27;base&#x27; and then use loose minerals with a flat or pointed brush to make a very dramatic 1940&#x27;s/60&#x27;s inspired line.)</li>
            <li> This pencil is a great color, thank goodness for something besides black!  It is very soft though and takes a steady hand&lt;br /&gt;to use it..&lt;br /&gt;I also find that it smears easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to last well and you wind up with that slept in my make up all night look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again...</li>
            <li> I love how you don&#x27;t have to use much, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Smudges and wares off quickly. I like that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;healthy ingredients&amp;#34;. I like the color. But I will be looking for something different in the future that hopefully stays vibrant and lasts longer! And doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> What can I say besides gluten free and that is very exciting to me.  Very nice pencil. easy to work with on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like the charcoal pencils, this one is great. I heard that it was better for your lashes and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This works for me. I plan to order another one. I just wished it came with a pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and looks very nice on the eyes.</li>
            <li> The Mineral Fusion Natural Eye Pencil is the best eye liner that I have ever used. Goes on smooth, stays on, and easy to get off. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of mineral make up.  It is excellent it goes on well. It never smudges and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Like the ingredients but it doesn&#x27;t stay for a long time.. I guess it depends on what kind of eye lid you have.</li>
            <li> Dark black no mess easy to clean great it is the best of the best eye pencil i ever used from 15 years don&#x27;t think you will love it.</li>
            <li> Good if you like a smudgey eye.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and stays on all day. No chemicals and no clumping. Exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smoother than regular pencil eyeliner. i love it.</li>
            <li> It goes on great but vanishes within an hour.</li>
