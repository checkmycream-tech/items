            <li>Then you activate it by putting a bit more water on your hair.</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like most shampoos do, and that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>much better than that over rated/ over priced wen stuff</li>
            <li>To sum it up, I think this is one of the best smoothing shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and plan to use for a long time.</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean, soft, and shiny, but the best thing is that it smells great.</li>
            <li>FAB..leaves hair feeling soft and smelling great..</li>
            <li>have baby fine hair &amp;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fabulous hair</li>
            <li>but this product makes my hair full and shiny.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels soft, clean and Healthy</li>
            <li>It is better than Wen products and it takes less product for better results!</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine</li>
            <li>One easy step and hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair manageable and soft!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive/allergic to scented things, and I thought it smelled like cheap men&#x27;s&#x27; cologne at first.</li>
            <li>and it smells great only deep conditoner for me</li>
            <li>You can see the results in the first two uses, after two weeks of use I felt really changes in my hair, it has been silky, soft, healthy and with added shine.</li>
            <li>if you have colored hair it sure preservs until you r next color.. smells</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks totally different since I&#x27;ve started using it.  :)</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t smell it anymore, so either my first tube was smellier, or I got used to the scent.</li>
            <li>All In One Shampoo &amp; Balm leaves your hair silky soft, shiny and smelling fabulous.  </li>
            <li>My long wavy hair felt more moisturized after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would say this is comparable to Wen in performance, but much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as Wen directs you to use.  </li>
            <li>I really like how my hair looks and feels with this shampoo and balm.</li>
            <li>Since I like to wear it straight</li>
            <li>it is so soft and manageable and definitely has more body.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, so this tube lasts long, makes your hair shiny, smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend..</li>
            <li>Beware, it does NOT lather, but trust me, your hair will not only be clean, it&#x27;ll also be soft and feel conditioned.</li>
            <li>(Although I still give my hair a quick flat iron for smoothing.)</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and naturally lacks body, I am nearly 60 years old and my hair is colored every four weeks, blow dried every day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I applied a smoothing serum but definitely didn&#x27;t need it...</li>
            <li>I only use it every other time washing my hair, as it tends to make my hair greasy if I use it every time, but I love this stuff and</li>
            <li>The same product I buy at the salon, and more than half the price.  </li>
            <li>Only giving three stars though because it is too perfumey for my liking and it is a very fake/chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also have ethnic hair, but much thinner, and this product weighs it down, leaving it greasy and sticky no matter how much I rinse it out!</li>
            <li>Does not lather which is weird at first, but my hair looks healthy and kept its color longer.  </li>
            <li>it kind of left my hair limp, dull and a bit greasy as did the Uniq One hair treatment my hairdresser sprayed on the first time I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I am older and have gray hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>I normally use a smoothing shampoo, smoothing conditioner and then apply either Moroccan Oil or a smoothing serum before blowing it dry.</li>
            <li>I have nearly waist length hair that was very dry before I began using uniqONE</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have nearly waist length hair that was very dry before I began using uniqONE</li>
            <li> My hair generally tolerates most 2-in-1 products as long as I keep up a weekly conditioning treatment; I found that this product was also difficult to wash out and weighed down my hair, leaving residues and generally feeling gross throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It is low sudsing but cleans my thick hair very well -- no conditioner needed -- no knots at all!  </li>
            <li> no oily scalp or flat hair.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, two in one shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce, no more dried straw.  </li>
            <li> the all in one spray has really helped my dry limp hair come to life and have body and bounce!</li>
            <li> The tube was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried this it left my hair feeling heavy and unclean.  </li>
            <li> You put it on wet hair and spread it around.</li>
            <li> There is really no way to rinse out the stickiness; I have to use another shampoo to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I must say that I don&#x27;t think my hair is as shiny as it is with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> al day long; few products gave that result</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but not sure yet about the quality of this product, because I only tried it once, but it gave me feeling like I am still missing conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair but with lots of body &amp; shine.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> this shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> i have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I find it hard to squeeze the product out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> The smell took a few days to get used to ..</li>
            <li> As noted in the other reviews, this product does not lather which makes it incredibly difficult to massage into my scalp and spread through my medium-long length Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> its a all in one and that usually dosen&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get used to not having any lather though.  </li>
            <li> I could see that if you have thin hair, this might be hard to rinse out and make your hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair.  </li>
            <li> I hated it at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thick which also makes it difficult to squeeze out of the tube</li>
            <li> (my bathroom gets very cold in the morning, which probably doesn&#x27;t help its viscosity).  </li>

            <li> The best! Very good service of this seller, as well! I highly recommend..</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever. If you like Wen you&#x27;ll like this one, no sulfates, both shampoo and conditioner, hydrating and no residue. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product. The smell took a few days to get used to .. That&#x27;s the only downside.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Just make sure to rinse well!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, loads of volume, very conditioning. I only wash my hair twice a week now- no oily scalp or flat hair. This stuff just works great</li>
            <li> I have been using for about  a year and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love it!  The same product I buy at the salon, and more than half the price.  I can get 2 for the price of one!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but not sure yet about the quality of this product, because I only tried it once, but it gave me feeling like I am still missing conditioner. Need to use more to be sure about quality of this product!</li>
            <li> i have thick long hair. im 43 i have tried hundreds of products in my life time. THIS IS GREAT. its a all in one and that usually dosen&#x27;t work for me. THIS IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I have tried.  My hair is straight and fine this shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I found about about this product at my hair salon. I used to shampoo twice, then condition. Now I just use Uniq One. You put it on wet hair and spread it around. Then you activate it by putting a bit more water on your hair. Beware, it does NOT lather, but trust me, your hair will not only be clean, it&#x27;ll also be soft and feel conditioned. One step and you&#x27;re done!  The only negative is the smell. I hated it at first. I&#x27;m very sensitive/allergic to scented things, and I thought it smelled like cheap men&#x27;s&#x27; cologne at first. Now I don&#x27;t smell it anymore, so either my first tube was smellier, or I got used to the scent. Either way, the pros about this product well outweigh the scent.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, two in one shampoo and conditioner.  Does not lather which is weird at first, but my hair looks healthy and kept its color longer.  I would definitely buy again.  Love these products.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo/conditioner.  One easy step and hair feels soft and clean.  It is hard to get used to not having any lather though.

            <li> UniqOne All In One Shampoo &amp; Balm leaves your hair silky soft, shiny and smelling fabulous.  My hairdresser recommended this product to me and I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who loves their hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean, soft, and shiny, but the best thing is that it smells great. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like most shampoos do, and that takes some getting used to. It&#x27;s like lotion for your hair. My long wavy hair felt more moisturized after using this shampoo. The tube was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> very good conditioner the best for heat syleing your hair and it smells great only deep conditoner for me i love it</li>
            <li> The product isamazing! You can see the results in the first two uses, after two weeks of use I felt really changes in my hair, it has been silky, soft, healthy and with added shine.</li>
            <li> I use nothing else. I don&#x27;t have fabulous hair but this product makes my hair full and shiny. Also it doesn&#x27;t fade hair color.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft and silky! I Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  It is low sudsing but cleans my thick hair very well -- no conditioner needed -- no knots at all!  Great shine!  I love this shampoo &amp; have bought it for my daughter &amp; daughter-in-law and have recommended it to family &amp; friends!!</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair looks and feels with this shampoo and balm. I am older and have gray hair that tends to be dry. This left my hair feeling soft and full. Only giving three stars though because it is too perfumey for my liking and it is a very fake/chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Makes my fine hair manageable and soft!!</li>
            <li> As noted in the other reviews, this product does not lather which makes it incredibly difficult to massage into my scalp and spread through my medium-long length Asian hair.  It&#x27;s quite thick which also makes it difficult to squeeze out of the tube (my bathroom gets very cold in the morning, which probably doesn&#x27;t help its viscosity).  My hair generally tolerates most 2-in-1 products as long as I keep up a weekly conditioning treatment; I found that this product was also difficult to wash out and weighed down my hair, leaving residues and generally feeling gross throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, wonderful for colored hair! You don&#x27;t need to use much, so this tube lasts long, makes your hair shiny, smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I have nearly waist length hair that was very dry before I began using uniqONE it is so soft and manageable and definitely has more body.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair but with lots of body &amp; shine. Since I like to wear it straight I normally use a smoothing shampoo, smoothing conditioner and then apply either Moroccan Oil or a smoothing serum before blowing it dry. Well, none of that is necessary with this shampoo &amp; balm. (Although I still give my hair a quick flat iron for smoothing.) The first time I used it I applied a smoothing serum but definitely didn&#x27;t need it...it kind of left my hair limp, dull and a bit greasy as did the Uniq One hair treatment my hairdresser sprayed on the first time I tried this product. I must say that I don&#x27;t think my hair is as shiny as it is with other shampoos. Also, this is not a &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; shampoo....you&#x27;ll just need a dollop in the shower to wash your hair. To sum it up, I think this is one of the best smoothing shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and plan to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels soft, clean and Healthy</li>
            <li> i like this shampoo,have be using for more them year, very happy with.</li>
            <li> much better than that over rated/ over priced wen stuff</li>
            <li> Best product for my hair second time i ordered ir; the hair smells good al day long; few products gave that result</li>
            <li> Great for color treated hair I have been using only this for 6 weeks my hair is in great shape and color lasts longer</li>
            <li> I have a friend with very coarse African-american hair who raved about this product, so I bought it. I also have ethnic hair, but much thinner, and this product weighs it down, leaving it greasy and sticky no matter how much I rinse it out! There is really no way to rinse out the stickiness; I have to use another shampoo to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Love this! I only use it every other time washing my hair, as it tends to make my hair greasy if I use it every time, but I love this stuff and the all in one spray has really helped my dry limp hair come to life and have body and bounce! My hair is so shiny and on the way to healthy! Love it!</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo, my hair feels so good</li>
            <li> This shampoo rocks.  Leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce, no more dried straw.  My hair is very fine and naturally lacks body, I am nearly 60 years old and my hair is colored every four weeks, blow dried every day.  Can&#x27;t be without this shampoo.</li>
