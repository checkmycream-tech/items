            <li>&amp; I got it because of the great Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about it.</li>
            <li>And the price is good because in the stores you will pay about $30.</li>
            <li>This product worked good.</li>
            <li>Even my split ends look good.</li>
            <li>My hair shi es and is full of body and best no frizzies.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and being cheap compare to others.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of bothersome</li>
            <li>smell is very strong (some people suggest wearing a mask, I did not find</li>
            <li>this strong, chemical smell takes over!</li>
            <li>I really love this keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>I really do love my results.</li>
            <li>I received tons of compliments on my healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>I was so determined to make sure every inch of hair had been touched by the product that I wound up over-saturating and couldn&#x27;t get a comb through to make it to the blow dry/flat iron steps.  </li>
            <li>Before buying the Keratin treatment, my hair was always, always, ALWAYS in a top knot or braid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spend more money on better product.</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>So make sure you have one or something that will catch it...</li>
            <li>So make sure you have one or something that will catch it...</li>
            <li>it was packaged nicely and it you go a lot of product in the bottles for a full head of hair...</li>
            <li>Very effective for natural hair!</li>
            <li>Hello all, this product is the most fantastic thing I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>Good product but very time comsuming to apply.</li>
            <li>It was easy &amp; inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>My one piece of advice would be to take your time with the straightening, because the first time I rushed through and there were pieces that obviously did not get as much.&lt;br /&gt;Please buy this product-it will make you feel beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and each time my hair was silky smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>So - I have to scrape off the substance because it won&#x27;t wash off with light rubbing.</li>
            <li>, detailed instructions.&lt;br /&gt;-Includes</li>
            <li>Great product and definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Her hair looked great but it only lasted one week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several applications of NuNaat and have always had great results</li>
            <li>After waiting 48 hours as instructed, I washed today with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I liked the ease of application and the results I got from using it the very 1st time.</li>
            <li>My hair felt better right away, it didn&#x27;t leave it gunky.  </li>
            <li>The end results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make a mess this time because I was able to better control the liquid (yay!), and was actually able to comb it all the way through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is good but the problem is the activity of keratin is still only one month</li>
            <li>and she was in the sun and water more than normal.  </li>
            <li>At under $20, this is definitely a great way to cut down on my spending.  </li>
            <li>Like I said - my hair is gorgeous afterward, and the keratin treatment keeps my hair from totally frizzing and puffing out when it&#x27;s hot and humid.</li>
            <li>Also, it did lighten my natural dark brown hair to a lighter brown, but it looks awesome on me</li>
            <li>Also, it did lighten my natural dark brown hair to a lighter brown, but it looks awesome on me</li>
            <li>but when all is done you have to admit it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nun Ultra Keratin Touch will leave your hair shiny and bouncy but is it worth hair breakage and inhaling fumes?  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>But the end results are worth it.</li>
            <li>It is time consuming to apply the product, but it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes longer, but its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use it again for a special occasion just because the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It is every bit worth the money if you are willing to put in 4 hours of work and 2 days of waiting.</li>
            <li>A little too good.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first home kit</li>
            <li>Most likely in the summer months when its really humid.  </li>
            <li>Then, when I do as stated in the directions and seal my hair at 400 degrees with my flat iron (which is a high-end brand that is awesome to work with), the product forms a hard caky substance that piles up on the plates.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough just like the directions &amp; testimonials.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it because it was the first one I ever saw in a drugstore, marketed for home use.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to have a little bit easier time managing it straight for awhile, &amp; to see how I liked the whole idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the time it took to do the whole process of applying it, I would rather go to a salon and get it done.</li>
            <li>Because I have to brush and comb through my hair when blowdrying in order to get it straight, I end up with lots of hair in my comb and brush because the NuNaat treatment is so sticky.</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s saving me $380, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>and the hair is still straight have not touch it once with any heating tool.</li>
            <li>have naturally very curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so straight</li>
            <li>So, those parts of my hair are not as straight.</li>
            <li>this helpede not as straight.</li>
            <li>Although I was forced to wash it out, I still had pretty nice results.  </li>
            <li>Straightening it with an amazing flat iron would still be a long process &amp; I&#x27;d keep a comb on hand for touch ups when out.</li>
            <li>The results had actually looked better than the regular keratin</li>
            <li>Also check your local drugstore for special offers and discount of this product.</li>
            <li>The other important aspect is aftercare, so you should use &amp;#34;without salt&amp;#34; or baby&#x27;s shampoo, and prevent swimming pools.</li>
            <li>My problem is that the process is very cumbersome (I experience more than normal hair loss during application), the shampoo burns my eyes, tons of smelly fumes rise from my flat iron during the sealing process and those fumes also burn my eyes, and the keratin treatment gets stuck to my flat iron and burns quickly, leaving a crusty mess that I have to scrape off.  </li>
            <li>This is a must if you have super freezy, dry and/or damage hair.</li>
            <li>At the end of the 6 months, I was ready for straight hair again but did not want to make the same mistakes as I did before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try to make this review short and simple, as many others have already written extensive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Wavy-curly, prone to frizz</li>
            <li>first time, I made a huge mess all over the bathroom due to the pure liquid glosser (it dripped and splashed everywhere).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an at-home keratin kit to hold me over between $400 professional treatments.  </li>
            <li>The box says 30 days, and so far it&#x27;s been 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>blow dry, straighten, even showering in hot water)</li>
            <li>If I was sentenced to live on a deserted island and could only take one item with me.....</li>
            <li>This will make the results last much longer instead of simply washing them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never felt comfortable with my hair, and I certainly never liked my hair.</li>
            <li>The process takes 4 hours of work on average, and you have to leave hair straight for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much healthier, stronger looking hair with less damage.</li>
            <li>miss my curly hair &amp; probably won&#x27;t do it again because it&#x27;s taking much longer than I thought to even go back to a slight curl.</li>
            <li>just a little too much and</li>

            <li> just a little too much and</li>
            <li> only thing was that I was not prepared with a smaller flat iron for the really short pieces of hair by my neck and nape.</li>
            <li> It flat ironed back out the next day, butthe blow-dryer was not enough</li>
            <li> It flat ironed back out the next day, butthe blow-dryer was not enough</li>
            <li> Lastly, the fact that the shampoo and fumes during flat ironing burn my eyes just make the entire NuNaat application and sealing process a hassle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have paid $150 for Keratin treatments in the past that did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> And you have to plan ahead because you have to apply it and straighten your hair with a flat iron</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 3 star score because the product does not last as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the process takes a little bit of time, it&#x27;s well worth it and mindless.</li>
            <li> I am white, with a frizzy mane of dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I used an expensive sulphate free shampoo and conditioner 4 days after initial application.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Black woman and after perms, blowouts and weaves destroyed my hair, I went neatural for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I mean my hair feels like pure silk.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found it lasts about twice as long or longer</li>
            <li> Went from curly, frizzy, thick and unmanageable hair to sleek straight hair.</li>
            <li> that you apply after shampooing and blow drying your hair becomes very sticky very fast so it is almost impossible for me to comb through it and blow dry it the second time as stated in the directions.</li>
            <li> Wash hair, then blow dry and section hair in four.</li>
            <li> After apply smoothing liquid on hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> This happens even though my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> your brush will stand no chance once that stuff starts to dry.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to blow dry, you can air dry your hair and it will work the same.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this keratin treatment.  My here no longer frizzes and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you have super freezy, dry and/or damage hair. I admit it is a time consuming process and a bit messy but when all is done you have to admit it is worth it.  My hair shi es and is full of body and best no frizzies.</li>
            <li> Good product but very time comsuming to apply. For the time it took to do the whole process of applying it, I would rather go to a salon and get it done.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon but from Walgreens. I brought this product recently and I LOVE IT! The smell is kind of bothersome but the results are amazing!!! Went from curly, frizzy, thick and unmanageable hair to sleek straight hair. Follow the directions exactly. Wash hair, then blow dry and section hair in four. After apply smoothing liquid on hair and then blow dry. Comb hair every 5 minutes and then wait 30 minutes. Shower hair with shampoo and conditioner that comes in box. Air dry or blow dry. I really do love my results. It&#x27;s a great product and being cheap compare to others. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Nun Ultra Keratin Touch will leave your hair shiny and bouncy but is it worth hair breakage and inhaling fumes?  I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and each time my hair was silky smooth and glossy. I received tons of compliments on my healthy looking hair. My problem is that the process is very cumbersome (I experience more than normal hair loss during application), the shampoo burns my eyes, tons of smelly fumes rise from my flat iron during the sealing process and those fumes also burn my eyes, and the keratin treatment gets stuck to my flat iron and burns quickly, leaving a crusty mess that I have to scrape off.  The keratin &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; that you apply after shampooing and blow drying your hair becomes very sticky very fast so it is almost impossible for me to comb through it and blow dry it the second time as stated in the directions. Because I have to brush and comb through my hair when blowdrying in order to get it straight, I end up with lots of hair in my comb and brush because the NuNaat treatment is so sticky. I&#x27;ve tried spritzing my hair with water and that works for  while but the stiffness returns as my hair dries. Then, when I do as stated in the directions and seal my hair at 400 degrees with my flat iron (which is a high-end brand that is awesome to work with), the product forms a hard caky substance that piles up on the plates. This happens even though my hair is dry. So - I have to scrape off the substance because it won&#x27;t wash off with light rubbing. Lastly, the fact that the shampoo and fumes during flat ironing burn my eyes just make the entire NuNaat application and sealing process a hassle.  Like I said - my hair is gorgeous afterward, and the keratin treatment keeps my hair from totally frizzing and puffing out when it&#x27;s hot and humid. It lasts just a little over a month, but the cons outweigh this. It&#x27;s just not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an at-home keratin kit to hold me over between $400 professional treatments.  At under $20, this is definitely a great way to cut down on my spending.  I purchased at Walgreens, and have now done two treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time, I made a huge mess all over the bathroom due to the pure liquid glosser (it dripped and splashed everywhere). I was so determined to make sure every inch of hair had been touched by the product that I wound up over-saturating and couldn&#x27;t get a comb through to make it to the blow dry/flat iron steps.  The solution makes your hair very stiff... just a little too much and your brush will stand no chance once that stuff starts to dry. Although I was forced to wash it out, I still had pretty nice results.  They just didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I went for it again, this time armed with a spray bottle for the glosser.  I didn&#x27;t make a mess this time because I was able to better control the liquid (yay!), and was actually able to comb it all the way through my hair.  Blow drying and flat ironing was still stiff, but doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is having to wash it again after going through all of this.  But since it&#x27;s saving me $380, I can&#x27;t really complain.  My hair is soft, shiny, and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!  I purchased another one to keep when I feel like I need this again.  Most likely in the summer months when its really humid.  Just be patient with the process.  The end results are worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is over priced, its wayyy cheaper @Walgreens just bought it 4 $12.99...&lt;br /&gt; Yea! $12.99!!!Didn&#x27;t use it yet but I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about it. Once I use it I will review about it.</li>
            <li> Did make my thick and extremely curly hair a little smoother. Not worth the effort of the process in my opinion. And the worst part is the smell. Any time heat is applied to your hair after you&#x27;ve applied this (blow dry, straighten, even showering in hot water) this strong, chemical smell takes over! And it lasts for at least a month. My husband even commented on it just being in the same room as me.</li>
            <li> I was so tentative to buy this product, but I got desperate. I am white, with a frizzy mane of dry, damaged hair. Before buying the Keratin treatment, my hair was always, always, ALWAYS in a top knot or braid. I never felt comfortable with my hair, and I certainly never liked my hair. After using NuNaat, I am so content.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have paid $150 for Keratin treatments in the past that did absolutely nothing for my hair. When I saw this product being sold for only $20, I jumped on it! I have used this twice now and just about to order my third.&lt;br /&gt;While the process takes a little bit of time, it&#x27;s well worth it and mindless. I follow the instructions given, and it works perfectly. My one piece of advice would be to take your time with the straightening, because the first time I rushed through and there were pieces that obviously did not get as much.&lt;br /&gt;Please buy this product-it will make you feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> After spending hours reading reviews, I finally decided that this was at least worth a try (didn&#x27;t want to pay 300 dollars for a Brazilian blowout). I will try to make this review short and simple, as many others have already written extensive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Wavy-curly, prone to frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gives the results of a Brazilian blowout for LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy, detailed instructions.&lt;br /&gt;-Includes gloves.&lt;br /&gt;-Results have lasted me for two months now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is very strong (some people suggest wearing a mask, I did not find this necessary).&lt;br /&gt;-It is time consuming. The process takes 4 hours of work on average, and you have to leave hair straight for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-If you can, get a friend to help (especially for the back).&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t need to blow dry, you can air dry your hair and it will work the same.&lt;br /&gt;-If you haven&#x27;t already, switch to using sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. This will make the results last much longer instead of simply washing them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are even considering buying this product, DO IT. It is every bit worth the money if you are willing to put in 4 hours of work and 2 days of waiting. The results are incredible and the savings are unbeatable!</li>
            <li> If I was sentenced to live on a deserted island and could only take one item with me.....this would be it.</li>
            <li> It is good but the problem is the activity of keratin is still only one month and you have to return do the treatment again.</li>
            <li> This works better for my hair than a very expensive chemical straightener that I had done in a salon! It&#x27;s a bit messy to do. And you have to plan ahead because you have to apply it and straighten your hair with a flat iron, then you can&#x27;t wash your hair or wear it tied back for 2 days. But the end results are worth it. The package says it lasts 30 days but I&#x27;ve found it lasts about twice as long or longer and I wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product! And the price is good because in the stores you will pay about $30. Very effective for natural hair!</li>
            <li> The product works but dye your hair after you use this.  I have brown hair and it turned reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Want no more Frizz? Shiny hair? This is the product for you! It is time consuming to apply the product, but it is completely worth it. Just grab a pal and some cocktails and you will be set in no time. It is recommended you dye your hair one week prior and if you would like to bleach it, you should do it at least 10 days before using this product. Since I recently used it I have not washed my hair in 7 days! and the hair is still straight have not touch it once with any heating tool. Great product and definitely recommend! Also check your local drugstore for special offers and discount of this product. I purchased it from a local Walgreens for $12.49!</li>
            <li> My daughter has black hair (4a) that is relaxed and shoulder length.  Her hair looked great but it only lasted one week. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we were on a cruise and she was in the sun and water more than normal.  I would use it again for a special occasion just because the price is reasonable.  I used about half the bottle for one application.  Note that the product consistency is like water unlike regular keratin which is slightly creamy. The results had actually looked better than the regular keratin I used which is the Qod Max Organiq which I also recommend ($200 for 32 oz bottle --I have not seen a smaller size other than 4 oz; no fumes and lasts at least two months; great if you have the money to shell out one time).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several applications of NuNaat and have always had great results BUT this box arrived damaged with half the contents having leaked out.</li>
            <li> This product worked good. A little too good. The box says 30 days, and so far it&#x27;s been 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally very curly hair. Straightening it with an amazing flat iron would still be a long process &amp; I&#x27;d keep a comb on hand for touch ups when out. I like wearing my hair down but always had it in a ponytail because it flies, frizzes, &amp; &#x27;fros up everywhere. Forget about running your fingers through it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first home kit &amp; I got it because of the great Amazon reviews. It was easy enough just like the directions &amp; testimonials. I just wanted to have a little bit easier time managing it straight for awhile, &amp; to see how I liked the whole idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss my curly hair &amp; probably won&#x27;t do it again because it&#x27;s taking much longer than I thought to even go back to a slight curl. However I give it 5 stars because it does the job well. It was easy &amp; inexpensive. If you do straighten your hair all the time, or were thinking of spending $$$ in a salon for a Brazilian blowout, just get this instead.</li>
            <li> it was packaged nicely and it you go a lot of product in the bottles for a full head of hair... i did this on 28 inches hair...... 4 bundles</li>
            <li> So easier to use than the last brand I bought and no formaldehyde.  My hair felt better right away, it didn&#x27;t leave it gunky.  After waiting 48 hours as instructed, I washed today with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  With a little bit of argon oil, I styled my hair as usual.  It&#x27;s so silky and shiny!  Plus, I am not hesitant to do this again in the next 30-45 days!!  There was plenty left for a second application on my jaw-length hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product the results were amazing. I must say the product does work. I have 4b/4c hair that is relaxed. I bought this product to help stretch my relaxers. I liked the ease of application and the results I got from using it the very 1st time. The only reason I am giving this product 3 stars is because the 2nd time I used it the results were not at all the same. My hair stayed brittle on the ends after a thorough application. I don&#x27;t know what happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am giving this product a 3 star score because the product does not last as long as it says it does. I used an expensive sulphate free shampoo and conditioner 4 days after initial application. This is why I had to redo my hair. This product washed out in spite of using proper after care.</li>
            <li> Damaged my hair, hard to comb through when using product and breaks off hair. Other keratin treatment I have used did not do that. This product is cheaper for a reason. I&#x27;d spend more money on better product. Do not use if you want healthy hair</li>
            <li> After having damaging perms for years, I found this product and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Bees Knees&amp;#34;. I love this. Much healthier, stronger looking hair with less damage.</li>
            <li> This product has excellent quality. Although the box says that the effect duration is 30 days, usually can be about three months, depending on the speed of hair growth. The other important aspect is aftercare, so you should use &amp;#34;without salt&amp;#34; or baby&#x27;s shampoo, and prevent swimming pools.</li>
            <li> Hello all, this product is the most fantastic thing I have ever come across. I am a professional Black woman and after perms, blowouts and weaves destroyed my hair, I went neatural for 6 months. At the end of the 6 months, I was ready for straight hair again but did not want to make the same mistakes as I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the expensive keratin treatments and just could not see myself using anything with formaldahyde. I found this Nunaat keratin treatment in duane reade for $26. I mainly bought it because it was the first one I ever saw in a drugstore, marketed for home use. I kept it in my cabinet for a month. I finally took the plunge 3 days ago and Oh My God!!! My hair feels like the expensive weaves that I use to buy. I mean my hair feels like pure silk. My hair has never been straighter or longer. It blows in the wind, it moves when I walk, I have never experienced anything like this before. Even my split ends look good. The strands of my hair feel stronger, like wheat. Oh, and it blow dries in seconds. I can actually wash my hair after the gym (you guys know we do not get down like that). My hair is so straight I feel bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t freak out while your going through the application process. When doing the strip wash, try to do it while standing in the shower so the water rains down on your head and your hair stays flat. This way it will be less tangled when you blow dry it, as you just washed every lick of oil from it. When you wash your hair with your head flipped over the tub, the hair tanlges, which can mean breakage for us when combing it out.  When you blow dry the keratin into your hair, you will fear your pulling your hair out because it is so stiff. Just part the hair into small sections, comb it out, then comb while blow drying. It takes longer, but its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only thing was that I was not prepared with a smaller flat iron for the really short pieces of hair by my neck and nape. So, those parts of my hair are not as straight. So make sure you have one or something that will catch it... Also, it did lighten my natural dark brown hair to a lighter brown, but it looks awesome on me (I&#x27;m just saying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost forgot, if you sweat in your head do whatever you can to prevent it during the 48 hour period. I noticed that my roots got a little crimpled one night during the 48 hour period from sweat. It flat ironed back out the next day, butthe blow-dryer was not enough so I think some of the keratin was stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helpede not as straight.
