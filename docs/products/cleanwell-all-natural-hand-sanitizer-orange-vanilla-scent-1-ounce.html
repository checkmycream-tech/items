            <li>I&#x27;ve found the perfect hand sanitizer!  </li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>It is not the best.</li>
            <li>As best I can tell - this is the one to use.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the harmful brands that use triclosan!</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>great smell.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and no worries</li>
            <li>But, this is actually a great product.</li>
            <li>A great way to sanitize your hands, and fits great in your pocket or jacket.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Product works well gas a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This one does neither -- pleasant scent (for men and women) that doesn&#x27;t linger, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise this is a good purse/car size package</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good time.  </li>
            <li>Great handy size, and affordable.</li>
            <li>I was quite happy with the size and function of the bottle, but I didn&#x27;t love the thyme scent, so I went to CleanWell&#x27;s own website and bought some orange vanilla scented ones.  </li>
            <li>Love this sanitizer!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for travel - it fits in pants pockets and purse/briefcase compartments easily - and it lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li>but it was an add on item at an amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, the packaging and the spray feature...</li>
            <li>Pricy but nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and smells really nice!</li>
            <li>I am a happy mommy knowing it is all-natural and kid friendly.</li>
            <li>Love the flip top!</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem to be safe and effective.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>better off with .50 cent purel bottles</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I know :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Reasons to avoid hand sanitizers are many, but sometimes you&#x27;re just not around soap and water.</li>
            <li>My favorite hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Easy to throw in my purse.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling this sanitizer leaves on my hands.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light smell, cleans up my hands, no alcohol.  </li>
            <li>But worth the pain to know I&#x27;m not doing any harm to myself or my unborn baby :)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that was alcohol free but could help with keeping my hands clean while traveling.  </li>
            <li>I like the alternative of something more natural and non alchohol based but the smell was just too strong for me and was more musty like.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong and funny!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s another soapy like the Clean well wipes can be.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good (not too strong); non-toxic; and won&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to the Honest company spray hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Out of all the hand sanitizers I&#x27;ve tried - this wins.</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct odor about it, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet, orange smell that is neither mild nor overpowering and that goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>But I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>there is no alchohol vapor and it doesnt dry out your skin.  :)</li>
            <li>Easy to open and spray!  </li>
            <li>even the size is great and portable, but the actual product was odd.</li>
            <li>The spray requires 2-3 pumps to really coat your hands</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing much.</li>
            <li>not because I felt that I really needed hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I heard regular hand snaitizer has harmful ingredients so love that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend hand sanitizer and clean well foaming hand soap as well</li>
            <li>Based on the number of uses it says it has, it seems like an even better deal (cost-wise) than your traditional Purell type of products, BUT even with 3-4 squirts (they consider one squirt a use), there isn&#x27;t enough to even spread all around my average-female hands.  </li>
            <li>Aroma is fine - not bad, not amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly the opposite.  </li>
            <li>Only negative is you need to use more sprays to cover your hands than the bottle says, but still worth getting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that my hands really felt clean after either.</li>
            <li>This product leaves a strange residue that actually made me want to wash my hands instead of feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this product is killing plenty of germs, but I can still detect the icky thyme smell even with the orange vanilla or</li>
            <li>Does not compare to the old Burt&#x27;s Bees......</li>
            <li>We purchase and use these frequently.  </li>
            <li>Small, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>I love the cleanwell brand as I&#x27;m pregnant and felt guilty evertime I used regular, alcohol based hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>small quantity - should have read more carefully.  </li>
            <li>so easy to spray on kids hands without the sticky or foamy mess the other hand sanitizers have.</li>
            <li>Does not dry your hands like the alcohol based products...</li>
            <li>I was actually a little skeptical about  buying this because all the reviews were so good.</li>

            <li> Some alcohol-free products have ingredients far worse than their high alcohol counter-parts.</li>
            <li> We like the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem sticky, not sure how well it works yet since I&#x27;ve only used it to test out the scent,</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use any other hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> it goes to one tiny spot and seems hard to spread around all over my hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated a 1 in the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s safety database, so it&#x27;s much less toxic than anti-bacterial hand sanitizers with either alcohol or triclosan.  </li>
            <li> but I am not a huge fan of how when it squirts</li>
            <li> The only hand sanitizer I use as it does it&#x27;s job without harsh unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the moisturizing claim, but it actually does make my hands softer after I use it!  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to quantify how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Some hand sanitizers have even been tied to negative health issues.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> They are bad for your skin and small horrible...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a sanitizer that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible or leave a film.  </li>
            <li> the smell gives me a headache :(</li>
            <li> I hate alchohol based hand sanitizers.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this product is killing plenty of germs, but I can still detect the icky thyme smell even with the orange vanilla or whatever scent it&#x27;s supposed to be. Meh. I&#x27;m going to go back to the Honest company spray hand sanitizer. It smells a lot better.</li>
            <li> Smells great. The spray requires 2-3 pumps to really coat your hands but otherwise this is a good purse/car size package</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Light smell, cleans up my hands, no alcohol.  Easy to throw in my purse.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to carry around. I got it for my daughter to use while we&#x27;re out at the store, restaurant, etc.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and smells really nice!</li>
            <li> so easy to spray on kids hands without the sticky or foamy mess the other hand sanitizers have. love this</li>
            <li> I like the alternative of something more natural and non alchohol based but the smell was just too strong for me and was more musty like.  I&#x27;m not sure that my hands really felt clean after either.</li>
            <li> I saw CleanWell&#x27;s regular (citrus herb) scented pocket hand sanitizer at the grocery store and picked it up.  I was quite happy with the size and function of the bottle, but I didn&#x27;t love the thyme scent, so I went to CleanWell&#x27;s own website and bought some orange vanilla scented ones.  I&#x27;ve found the perfect hand sanitizer!  It&#x27;s a great size for travel - it fits in pants pockets and purse/briefcase compartments easily - and it lasts for a while.  I&#x27;ve been using mine about once a day for months and can still hear a lot of liquid inside.  I was a bit skeptical of the moisturizing claim, but it actually does make my hands softer after I use it!  It has a nice sweet, orange smell that is neither mild nor overpowering and that goes away after a few minutes.  And the smell is not from some synthetic fragrance, but from orange oil and vanilla extract.  It&#x27;s rated a 1 in the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s safety database, so it&#x27;s much less toxic than anti-bacterial hand sanitizers with either alcohol or triclosan.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing much. Pricey compared to others.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good (not too strong); non-toxic; and won&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> small quantity - should have read more carefully.  better off with .50 cent purel bottles</li>
            <li> I like the actual product, but after using it about twice it is halfway gone. It takes about eight sprays to actually coat your hands in the product. back to purel for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great! No sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Love this sanitizer!  Does not dry your hands like the alcohol based products...great smell.  Would definitely recommend hand sanitizer and clean well foaming hand soap as well</li>
            <li> Yuck.  Yuck.  This doesn&#x27;t smell like any orange vanilla I&#x27;ve smelled before.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Based on the number of uses it says it has, it seems like an even better deal (cost-wise) than your traditional Purell type of products, BUT even with 3-4 squirts (they consider one squirt a use), there isn&#x27;t enough to even spread all around my average-female hands.

            <li> I found this in a local &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; grocery store while on vacation and came to Amazon hoping to find it.  I not only found it but it was an add on item at an amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all I&#x27;ll use on my kids.  It&#x27;s not sticky like regular anti-bac and it&#x27;s another soapy like the Clean well wipes can be.  Great smell and no worries if my toddler sticks her fingers in her mouth after!</li>
            <li> I was actually a little skeptical about  buying this because all the reviews were so good. But, this is actually a great product. It doesn&#x27;t stink and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and spray!  I have one in my car and one in my purse.  Love the flip top!</li>
            <li> I love the cleanwell brand as I&#x27;m pregnant and felt guilty evertime I used regular, alcohol based hand sanitizer.  I will continue using these to keep in my purse even after pregnancy but I am not a huge fan of how when it squirts it goes to one tiny spot and seems hard to spread around all over my hands.  But worth the pain to know I&#x27;m not doing any harm to myself or my unborn baby :)</li>

            <li> The only hand sanitizer I use as it does it&#x27;s job without harsh unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is not the best. I thought it was a much bigger container.</li>
            <li> As best I can tell - this is the one to use. Reasons to avoid hand sanitizers are many, but sometimes you&#x27;re just not around soap and water. The ingredients seem to be safe and effective. Some alcohol-free products have ingredients far worse than their high alcohol counter-parts. Some hand sanitizers have even been tied to negative health issues. Out of all the hand sanitizers I&#x27;ve tried - this wins.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. A great way to sanitize your hands, and fits great in your pocket or jacket.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and funny!</li>
            <li> Keeps the germs away without chemicals. Only negative is you need to use more sprays to cover your hands than the bottle says, but still worth getting.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a sanitizer that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible or leave a film.  This one does neither -- pleasant scent (for men and women) that doesn&#x27;t linger, and gets the job done.  Great handy size, and affordable.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand sanitizer. Pricy but nice.</li>
            <li> Does not compare to the old Burt&#x27;s Bees......where did you go Burt&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling this sanitizer leaves on my hands. It does have a distinct odor about it, but not overbearing. I am a happy mommy knowing it is all-natural and kid friendly. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> The bottle with the fliptop Is awesome, but the smell of this product is awful.  Definitely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> We purchase and use these frequently.  I put them in my purse, my kids keep them in their backpacks, and we stash some in the car.  We don&#x27;t use any other hand sanitizer.  We like the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out.</li>
