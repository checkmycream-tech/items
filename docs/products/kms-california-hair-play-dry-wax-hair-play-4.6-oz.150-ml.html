            <li>KMS is also great for creating any look you want, hair is easy to &#x27;play&#x27; with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and gives great lift for easy styling.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair this works great to weightlessly keep your style in place.</li>
            <li>The best part is it holds all day, which is unusual for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely the best stuff around.  </li>
            <li>They get a nice texture and helps hold the curl.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were what impressed me most, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, better than using hair gel!</li>
            <li>but this by far was the best.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and a mid-neck length layered</li>
            <li>I use this product on my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many spray waxes and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Smells great, reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It seems to be more like hairspray than what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Someone else will be buying me more when I run out....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li>Tried applying it with a blow dryer to distribute it more evenly</li>
            <li>Having tried hundreds of products I am very happy at last....</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to get my hair to keep</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bed Head manipulator &amp; Kenra taffy for years of which I still love but this stuff....</li>
            <li>and I use it to give me more texture in my hair.</li>
            <li>Better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling like most waxes/pomades do.</li>
            <li>Looking for a product to replace the no longer manufactured product I love.</li>
            <li>this works, but isnt my favorite, but I am still in mourning over the loss of my favorite product.</li>
            <li>I spray it in my hands and rub through my hair where I want more texture.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel size that fits in any bag.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product.  </li>
            <li>this is perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>I have given it to many friends and now they love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product in stores and could not find it anywhere - was glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Better than any wax I have ever used</li>
            <li>Have tried many many products that claim to do what the KMS Hair Play does</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>You would be better advised spending your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, it holds the style in place better than hairspray and mousse.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a bunch but this dry wax is awesome</li>
            <li>Best dry wax ever!  </li>
            <li>works best when sprayed on wet hair</li>
            <li>It is light, controls frizz/fly aways, and keeps away static.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it is light and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it was more readily available, so everyone would know about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to work through my hair.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have fine hair, this product is a must have.  </li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I have used freeze and shine for years because I have fine hair and it needed glue to hold it.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for my sassy short hair!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great - especially on straighter hair that you want to hold a wave or curl.</li>
            <li>I may have gotten a defective bottle or something, but this is simply a light hairspray from what I can gather.</li>
            <li>Great for short, funky hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>I love spritzing it in some freshly done curls and shaking them out a bit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and priced right!</li>
            <li>I could have bought it right then and there, but I knew Amazon would have it for a better price, even with shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was right :)</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>Keep my hair straight in the most humid weather</li>
            <li>But works great on my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>this is a great product, gives you the right amount of texture without being too heavy or to light.</li>
            <li>Used on me at salon first!</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calm and controlled from day one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but so far love the texture.</li>
            <li>This is my forth can, this stuff is great, keeps your hair in place all day without stiff hairspray...</li>
            <li>The spray wax is great and stays flexible, doesn&#x27;t get stiff like hairspray.</li>
            <li>your hair goes right</li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin hair!</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a sharp scent, but that quickly dissipates, and it leaves a nice, soft texture on your hair that you can &#x27;amp&#x27; up with your fingers or a brush.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and was having trouble finding something to give my hair texture without weighing it down and this product works great!</li>
            <li>I dont normally use any product, but the last time I got a cut, the girl put a little of this stuff in my hair and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a stiff feeling which I love!</li>
            <li>I simply spray some of this in before styling, style and let set, then finger comb through and spray again for huge body.</li>
            <li>They need to be a bit more careful when they ship, otherwise, I have no problem with the product itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and really like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to use this rather than using hairspray because hairspray is so sticky and this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all</li>
            <li>One of my friends really loves this product</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use to much though or at the roots.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair look so much fuller</li>
            <li>Nice volume and no sticky heavy residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products</li>
            <li>I went back to my Paul Mitchell spray wax (highly recommend it if you need a spray wax), and I use this as a (pricey) light hairspray if I need it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great the next day without a wash and very little effort to get it styled.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make your hair oily and looks good the next morning too!  </li>
            <li>Works good on wet, as well as dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine wavy hair that tends to be flat and lifeless, this product not only adds volume and texture but also defines the waves.</li>
            <li>The Redkin gave me more of a softer, less crunchy look.  </li>
            <li>I actually use it instead of hairspray, just a quick spray here</li>
            <li>This works good on half Long hair....</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with fine/straight hair who wishes they could get that blow-out look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Really holds your hair in place but without a crackly feel, it&#x27;s just sort of soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Redkin spray wax but thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li>I tried to get around paying 18.00 for my normal Redken spray wax.  </li>
            <li>I love messy beach hair</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter as she swears by it and also has fine hair that she wears in a short spiky &#x27;do and ordered an extra bottle for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, limp, and does not hold back combing at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, as she said she wanted, some spray wax for her new hair style.</li>
            <li>I cant live without this stuff, works wonders for defining hair styles and flexibility.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>if you are looking for more hold with a wet look, this is definitely for you.  </li>
            <li>I have shaken it, heated it a little with the hair dryer (thinking that it may have sat for a long time and needed to warm the wax to get it to work right), but still the same result no wax at all.</li>
            <li>The vendor should be aware that items like that can loosen up in the shipping process if they&#x27;re not properly secured.</li>
            <li>I started purchasing this from my local hair salon because I LOVED it for my very short hair, now that my hair is past my shoulders</li>
            <li>After teasing the top layers of my hair around the crown with a teasing brush, I give the undersides a few blasts of this spray wax and use my fingers to style and smooth it back down.</li>
            <li>Holds all day, no stiff feeling and looks natural all the time...</li>
            <li>Also smells better than other dry wax sprays...</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have sprayed it directly into my hand</li>
            <li>Absolutely idea product for short, funky hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the soft feel it gives your hair.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised at the way it holds,  </li>
            <li>I have VERY straight, thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>first time using this type of product directions were limited</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years - for fine hair there is no better styling product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly glossy, but I use it as a light, final hold after I do my hair.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair cut into a long pixie.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last that long and really doesn&#x27;t work like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>After using the mold clay I spray this around my head (male 44 years old)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I feel like it makes my hair just look dirty instead of &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>This product weighed down my fine hair and looks a little oily without any of the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; that I am used to.</li>
            <li>bob-this stuff really weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Someone else will be buying me more when I run out....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> Tried applying it with a blow dryer to distribute it more evenly</li>
            <li> Having tried hundreds of products I am very happy at last....</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to get my hair to keep</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bed Head manipulator &amp; Kenra taffy for years of which I still love but this stuff....</li>
            <li> and I use it to give me more texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> Better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling like most waxes/pomades do.</li>
            <li> Looking for a product to replace the no longer manufactured product I love.</li>
            <li> this works, but isnt my favorite, but I am still in mourning over the loss of my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I spray it in my hands and rub through my hair where I want more texture.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel size that fits in any bag.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite product.  </li>
            <li> this is perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li> I have given it to many friends and now they love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product in stores and could not find it anywhere - was glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li> Better than any wax I have ever used</li>
            <li> Have tried many many products that claim to do what the KMS Hair Play does</li>
            <li> It was okay, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.</li>
            <li> You would be better advised spending your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, it holds the style in place better than hairspray and mousse.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a bunch but this dry wax is awesome</li>
            <li> Best dry wax ever!  </li>
            <li> works best when sprayed on wet hair</li>
            <li> It is light, controls frizz/fly aways, and keeps away static.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it is light and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was more readily available, so everyone would know about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to work through my hair.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have fine hair, this product is a must have.  </li>
            <li> If you have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I have used freeze and shine for years because I have fine hair and it needed glue to hold it.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for my sassy short hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great - especially on straighter hair that you want to hold a wave or curl.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a defective bottle or something, but this is simply a light hairspray from what I can gather.</li>
            <li> Great for short, funky hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> I love spritzing it in some freshly done curls and shaking them out a bit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and priced right!</li>
            <li> I could have bought it right then and there, but I knew Amazon would have it for a better price, even with shipping.  </li>
            <li> I was right :)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> Keep my hair straight in the most humid weather</li>
            <li> But works great on my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, gives you the right amount of texture without being too heavy or to light.</li>
            <li> Used on me at salon first!</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calm and controlled from day one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but so far love the texture.</li>
            <li> This is my forth can, this stuff is great, keeps your hair in place all day without stiff hairspray...</li>
            <li> The spray wax is great and stays flexible, doesn&#x27;t get stiff like hairspray.</li>
            <li> your hair goes right</li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin hair!</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a sharp scent, but that quickly dissipates, and it leaves a nice, soft texture on your hair that you can &#x27;amp&#x27; up with your fingers or a brush.  </li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and was having trouble finding something to give my hair texture without weighing it down and this product works great!</li>
            <li> I dont normally use any product, but the last time I got a cut, the girl put a little of this stuff in my hair and I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a stiff feeling which I love!</li>
            <li> I simply spray some of this in before styling, style and let set, then finger comb through and spray again for huge body.</li>
            <li> They need to be a bit more careful when they ship, otherwise, I have no problem with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and really like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to use this rather than using hairspray because hairspray is so sticky and this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all</li>
            <li> One of my friends really loves this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use to much though or at the roots.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair look so much fuller</li>
            <li> Nice volume and no sticky heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products</li>
            <li> I went back to my Paul Mitchell spray wax (highly recommend it if you need a spray wax), and I use this as a (pricey) light hairspray if I need it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great the next day without a wash and very little effort to get it styled.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make your hair oily and looks good the next morning too!  </li>
            <li> Works good on wet, as well as dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine wavy hair that tends to be flat and lifeless, this product not only adds volume and texture but also defines the waves.</li>
            <li> The Redkin gave me more of a softer, less crunchy look.  </li>
            <li> I actually use it instead of hairspray, just a quick spray here</li>
            <li> This works good on half Long hair....</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with fine/straight hair who wishes they could get that blow-out look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really holds your hair in place but without a crackly feel, it&#x27;s just sort of soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Redkin spray wax but thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get around paying 18.00 for my normal Redken spray wax.  </li>
            <li> I love messy beach hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as she swears by it and also has fine hair that she wears in a short spiky &#x27;do and ordered an extra bottle for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, limp, and does not hold back combing at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, as she said she wanted, some spray wax for her new hair style.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this stuff, works wonders for defining hair styles and flexibility.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> if you are looking for more hold with a wet look, this is definitely for you.  </li>
            <li> I have shaken it, heated it a little with the hair dryer (thinking that it may have sat for a long time and needed to warm the wax to get it to work right), but still the same result no wax at all.</li>
            <li> The vendor should be aware that items like that can loosen up in the shipping process if they&#x27;re not properly secured.</li>
            <li> I started purchasing this from my local hair salon because I LOVED it for my very short hair, now that my hair is past my shoulders</li>
            <li> After teasing the top layers of my hair around the crown with a teasing brush, I give the undersides a few blasts of this spray wax and use my fingers to style and smooth it back down.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, no stiff feeling and looks natural all the time...</li>
            <li> Also smells better than other dry wax sprays...</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have sprayed it directly into my hand</li>
            <li> Absolutely idea product for short, funky hair.  </li>
            <li> I like the soft feel it gives your hair.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised at the way it holds,  </li>
            <li> I have VERY straight, thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> first time using this type of product directions were limited</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years - for fine hair there is no better styling product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly glossy, but I use it as a light, final hold after I do my hair.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair cut into a long pixie.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last that long and really doesn&#x27;t work like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> After using the mold clay I spray this around my head (male 44 years old)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I feel like it makes my hair just look dirty instead of &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> This product weighed down my fine hair and looks a little oily without any of the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; that I am used to.</li>
            <li> bob-this stuff really weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I have used the KMS molding paste in the past and thought that this dry wax would be just as good, but I am not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> My hair immediately went flat.</li>
            <li> Second, it is not workable and leaves hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair as well.</li>
            <li> Just smells kind of bad.  </li>
            <li> I would use sparingly first and spray as you go because if you use to much then you hair will look dirty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this for as long as KMS California continues to make it, even after my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and gives it flexible movement.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s minor!)</li>
            <li> My stylist used hairplay dry wax and I was amazed that it held my hair, but it was still flexible.  </li>
            <li> is the smell, which is unfortunately reminiscent of NyQuil, but it fades almost immediately so it&#x27;s definitely not worth taking off a star.</li>
            <li> Just spray and fluff</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful to not over do it.</li>
            <li> and I wasted quite a bit of the content finding proper usage .</li>
            <li> Totally eliminates the frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I spray a little on before I dry my hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and does not weigh my hair down if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair this stuff is pretty pointless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before I ordered the Joico product, because I needed something to give my short and moderately thick hair some boost.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would weigh it down</li>
            <li> I found it to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars, but when they shipped it to me, they did not tape down the cap to the can itself.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
            <li> This product holds my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other hair product over this one!</li>
            <li> and then after I style it to give it a slightly unpolished look.</li>
            <li> It is just like what I bought at ULTA and for much less than they charge for it.</li>
            <li> i am a black woman, so think halle berry&#x27;s hair style.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I usually spray my thick wavy hair when it is wet and it gives me a little crunchy wet look.  </li>
            <li> you just need a little bit</li>
            <li> and this doesnt add the bulk and make it heavy.</li>
            <li> I order this every few months.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few KMS products I just reordered.</li>
            <li> a few times and DON&#x27;T TOUCH MY HAIR AFTER.  </li>
            <li> Does not make your hair stiff - it is still pliable but holds style</li>
            <li> It seemed to hold as well as gel but doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or stiff.</li>
            <li> (My husband has extremely thick wavy hair, and he uses a little of this to finish his hair because it keeps down the frizz and fly-aways)</li>
            <li> No more just washed problems.</li>
            <li> And, no more scalp crust!  </li>
            <li> It adds volume and life to thin, dull hair.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the scalp crust created by the freeze and shine as well as the hair being hard.  </li>
            <li> First off, it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I never thought my hair could be this thick looking!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that can get frizzy in the summer</li>
            <li> Poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this for the summer!</li>
            <li> looks so this helps my thin hair achieve it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of Buying because I use Redken hair wax</li>
            <li> bought this here because in my hometown this is crazy expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally use Redkin spray wax but thought I would try this.  It seems to be more like hairspray than what I was looking for.  I usually spray my thick wavy hair when it is wet and it gives me a little crunchy wet look.  The Redkin gave me more of a softer, less crunchy look.  A little seems to go a long way and if you are looking for more hold with a wet look, this is definitely for you.  If you want to keep curls together without the crunchy look or feeling, keep looking.  Plus, it has that hairspray smell that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I tried it and I love it. It is great and I will use it always. It does really good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and priced right! Adds great texture for piecing and a tousled look! Definitely would buy again. Used on me at salon first!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, gives you the right amount of texture without being too heavy or to light. works best when sprayed on wet hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  My husband uses, and my brother comes over to use it too...Nice hold and touchable!  Smells great too.  Someone else will be buying me more when I run out....</li>
            <li> This is my forth can, this stuff is great, keeps your hair in place all day without stiff hairspray...Just spray and fluff your hair goes right were you want it to...</li>
            <li> Good product, holds well.</li>
            <li> GREAT price and great seller, love KMS products! Perfect for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> I started purchasing this from my local hair salon because I LOVED it for my very short hair, now that my hair is past my shoulders I thought it would weigh it down but it doesn&#x27;t! I have VERY straight, thin, fine hair and I like to add wave or curl to it using my straightener. I simply spray some of this in before styling, style and let set, then finger comb through and spray again for huge body. I never thought my hair could be this thick looking! The best part is it holds all day, which is unusual for my type of hair. I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, crunchy, or tacky, and I can go a couple days without washing and just reset the curl because it reactivates the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with fine/straight hair who wishes they could get that blow-out look. (My husband has extremely thick wavy hair, and he uses a little of this to finish his hair because it keeps down the frizz and fly-aways)</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair. It&#x27;s a good product, but I feel like it makes my hair just look dirty instead of &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34;... Tried applying it with a blow dryer to distribute it more evenly but I don&#x27;t think it helped.</li>
            <li> This adds the perfect amount of hold and grit!</li>
            <li> Works good on wet, as well as dry hair.  Sometimes I spray it on my hands and run my fingers through my hair.  Adds texture and fullness to my short hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, not sticky and gives great control. Having tried hundreds of products I am very happy at last....</li>
            <li> My Daughter dances and has to have perfect hair, this product is a God sent!</li>
            <li> For those of us who have fine hair, this product is a must have.  I have tried many products to get my hair to keep it&#x27;s shape, but, this one seems to keep the hold.  I actually use it instead of hairspray, just a quick spray here and there does the trick.  KMS is also great for creating any look you want, hair is easy to &#x27;play&#x27; with</li>
            <li> I found it to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME. I spray a little on before I dry my hair and then after I style it to give it a slightly unpolished look. Not heavy or sticky. My hair looks great the next day without a wash and very little effort to get it styled.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way and does not weigh my hair down if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Keep my hair straight in the most humid weather</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s not greasy and gives great lift for easy styling.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my sassy short hair!</li>
            <li> I tried to get around paying 18.00 for my normal Redken spray wax.  This product weighed down my fine hair and looks a little oily without any of the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; that I am used to.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, limp, and does not hold back combing at all. I was hoping this product would help give it some texture to help with volume and style but it doesn&#x27;t last that long and really doesn&#x27;t work like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This is good... it&#x27;s not as sticky as traditional wax therefore easier to work with as well as wash out.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used. It took place of my American Crew, Mousse, and Hair Spray. All you need is this one product, Holds your hair in place all day and lasts forever. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other hair product over this one!</li>
            <li> It is just like what I bought at ULTA and for much less than they charge for it. Does not make your hair stiff - it is still pliable but holds style</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product! I&#x27;ve used Bed Head manipulator &amp; Kenra taffy for years of which I still love but this stuff....LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Stickiness in a can. Smells awesome. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to work through my hair. I have super thin hair as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have fine, limp hair cut into a long pixie. After teasing the top layers of my hair around the crown with a teasing brush, I give the undersides a few blasts of this spray wax and use my fingers to style and smooth it back down. It gives great lift and volume, awesome texture, and stays in virtually all day. My only quibble (and it&#x27;s minor!) is the smell, which is unfortunately reminiscent of NyQuil, but it fades almost immediately so it&#x27;s definitely not worth taking off a star. I&#x27;ll use this for as long as KMS California continues to make it, even after my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> I have a bob and I use it to give me more texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as she swears by it and also has fine hair that she wears in a short spiky &#x27;do and ordered an extra bottle for me. My hair is very fine and a mid-neck length layered bob-this stuff really weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great - especially on straighter hair that you want to hold a wave or curl.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before I ordered the Joico product, because I needed something to give my short and moderately thick hair some boost.  The reviews were what impressed me most, and the price was right.  It has a bit of a sharp scent, but that quickly dissipates, and it leaves a nice, soft texture on your hair that you can &#x27;amp&#x27; up with your fingers or a brush.  I would have given it five stars, but when they shipped it to me, they did not tape down the cap to the can itself.  It had come off in the box, and was cracked in several places.  I had to throw it away.  The vendor should be aware that items like that can loosen up in the shipping process if they&#x27;re not properly secured. They need to be a bit more careful when they ship, otherwise, I have no problem with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Not wax at all. I may have gotten a defective bottle or something, but this is simply a light hairspray from what I can gather. I have shaken it, heated it a little with the hair dryer (thinking that it may have sat for a long time and needed to warm the wax to get it to work right), but still the same result no wax at all. I have sprayed it directly into my hand and it just puddles no sign of any wax product at all. I went back to my Paul Mitchell spray wax (highly recommend it if you need a spray wax), and I use this as a (pricey) light hairspray if I need it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine turned me on to this stuff.  It&#x27;s great!  No overspray, holds my hair in place without stickiness.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years - for fine hair there is no better styling product.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, it&#x27;s easy to use, it holds the style in place better than hairspray and mousse.  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t get slimy when you get sweaty like mousse can.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser calls this &#x27;hair - do in a can&#x27;.  Love it!  Better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many spray waxes and this one is the best by far. It is light, controls frizz/fly aways, and keeps away static. I have curly hair and this is a must have for the days I straighten it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product! It adds volume and life to thin, dull hair. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a stiff feeling which I love! A little goes a long way so you have to be careful to not over do it.</li>
            <li> Best dry wax ever!  I&#x27;ve used many other products but this by far was the best. Great product, must try it.</li>
            <li> Great for short, funky hairstyles.  Smells great, reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this for the summer! I love messy beach hair looks so this helps my thin hair achieve it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Gave me lots of volume</li>
            <li> Great for styling doesn&#x27;t feel&lt;br /&gt;Stiff</li>
            <li> I have very fine wavy hair that tends to be flat and lifeless, this product not only adds volume and texture but also defines the waves. I don&#x27;t ever want to be out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, as she said she wanted, some spray wax for her new hair style. So, knowing she wouldn&#x27;t buy it herself, as she is selfless. Puts everyone else before her. I had to jump and get this without her knowing. She received it and and loved it. Seems to be exactly what she wanted. She couldn&#x27;t be more beautiful, when she is happy and thinks she looks good. This was a great buy and a bargain at thrice the price.</li>
            <li> If you have baby fine hair this is absolutely the best stuff around.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make your hair oily and looks good the next morning too!  My salon charges $22, Amazon $13!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just started using this but so far love the texture. It seemed to hold as well as gel but doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling like most waxes/pomades do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and really like it.</li>
            <li> Great spray wax, wonderful for texturizing</li>
            <li> Gave awesome volume when used with a blow dryer</li>
            <li> first time using this type of product directions were limited and I wasted quite a bit of the content finding proper usage .</li>
            <li> This works good on half Long hair....</li>
            <li> Looking for a product to replace the no longer manufactured product I love. this works, but isnt my favorite, but I am still in mourning over the loss of my favorite product. I will likely order again</li>
            <li> I use this product on my very fine hair.  I spray it in my hands and rub through my hair where I want more texture.  It is an aerosol and when you spray it, it is kinda tacky to the touch.  But works great on my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Introduced to this product by my hairdresser. Totally eliminates the frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky. A little pricey but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely idea product for short, funky hair.  This product was initially recommended to me by my hair guy and I just can&#x27;t get enough.  I love the travel size that fits in any bag.  Take it to the beach/lake/river to give your hair that extra spunk when it dries! LOVE.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and was having trouble finding something to give my hair texture without weighing it down and this product works great! Also smells better than other dry wax sprays...</li>
            <li> This works great for my hair.  I have fine thin hair and this doesnt add the bulk and make it heavy. I finally found a product so I get some lift and style.</li>
            <li> I have used freeze and shine for years because I have fine hair and it needed glue to hold it.  I was tired of the scalp crust created by the freeze and shine as well as the hair being hard.  My stylist used hairplay dry wax and I was amazed that it held my hair, but it was still flexible.  And, no more scalp crust!  Love it.  (and cheaper than paul Mitchell too)</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at my hair stylist&#x27;s salon &amp; bought it from her.  Then looked on Amazon and was delighted to find it AND at at cheaper price.  Great for tweaking your style between washings.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite product.  Nice volume and no sticky heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I love this product, better than using hair gel!</li>
            <li> this is perfect for short hair. great hold. great flexibility.</li>
            <li> bought this here because in my hometown this is crazy expensive. i like how this stuff doesn&#x27;t go all white flaky when it dries and it truly does spike your hair up. i am a black woman, so think halle berry&#x27;s hair style.</li>
            <li> I have used the KMS molding paste in the past and thought that this dry wax would be just as good, but I am not happy with it at all. First off, it smells terrible. Second, it is not workable and leaves hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I like the soft feel it gives your hair. I have long hair and gives it flexible movement.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this stuff, works wonders for defining hair styles and flexibility. I have given it to many friends and now they love it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of Buying because I use Redken hair wax but I was pleasantly surprised at the way it holds,  it&#x27;s much easier to use this rather than using hairspray because hairspray is so sticky and this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all you just need a little bit and it goes a long way.  this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love this product as it is light and not sticky.  I pay about $27 at my salon so this is a great savings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is priced well in comparison to others I have tried. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or stiff. Great for adding textures to layers.  I have purchased several cans and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Received &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; item without cap. Poorly packaged. Obviously sprayed before.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product in stores and could not find it anywhere - was glad to find it here.  Price was great as was the service! Thanks! Will definitely be making future purchases.</li>
            <li> Truly gives body to hair without stickiness.</li>
            <li> Better than any wax I have ever used</li>
            <li> Works great for texturizing styles!</li>
            <li> I order this every few months.  Really holds your hair in place but without a crackly feel, it&#x27;s just sort of soft and pliable.  I recommend it.  It also doesn&#x27;t clump your hair the way gels do.  I have very thick hair that can get frizzy in the summer and I like to use this in order to control flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to work. I can&#x27;t seem to find it at any stores.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Have tried many many products that claim to do what the KMS Hair Play does but none do it as well and it&#x27;s priced right....will always use this product.  Holds all day, no stiff feeling and looks natural all the time...love it!!!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair this works great to weightlessly keep your style in place. I have tried lots of different products, pomades, spiking glue, gels, etc. None of them worked because they were all too heavy and had too much moisture. My hair immediately went flat. The spray wax is great and stays flexible, doesn&#x27;t get stiff like hairspray.</li>
            <li> This is a great spray wax.  It gives my hair great texture.  I like to spray it in after styled as it gives that look like you have not washed your hair for a day or so...not nasty but more textured and holds a style better.  You can also get some great height and hold spraying to the roots.  I would use sparingly first and spray as you go because if you use to much then you hair will look dirty.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> One of my friends really loves this product so I thought I would try it.  It was okay, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love spritzing it in some freshly done curls and shaking them out a bit.  They get a nice texture and helps hold the curl.  Don&#x27;t use to much though or at the roots.  It&#x27;ll make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Needed something to help with texture. This product did a good job. Just smells kind of bad.  But still Like</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin hair!</li>
            <li> When I was introduced to this product at the salon, I knew i had a new&amp;#34;saving grace&amp;#34;. Fly sway hair has plagued me all my life until now. No more just washed problems. It&#x27;s calm and controlled from day one. Just wish it was more readily available, so everyone would know about it.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this wax. It&#x27;s slightly glossy, but I use it as a light, final hold after I do my hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few KMS products I just reordered. I purchased a bunch but this dry wax is awesome and I can&#x27;t live without.  After using the mold clay I spray this around my head (male 44 years old) a few times and DON&#x27;T TOUCH MY HAIR AFTER.  Use this after your hair is set to give it shine and that awesome waxy look.  I will always reorder when I&#x27;m out.  My hair is my life.</li>
            <li> This product holds my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I dont normally use any product, but the last time I got a cut, the girl put a little of this stuff in my hair and I loved it!  I could have bought it right then and there, but I knew Amazon would have it for a better price, even with shipping.  I was right :)&lt;br /&gt;Fast deliver and its perfect!  This stuff makes my hair look so much fuller and it doesnt leave it feeling crunchy.  I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair this stuff is pretty pointless. You would be better advised spending your money elsewhere. I would not buy this product again.</li>
