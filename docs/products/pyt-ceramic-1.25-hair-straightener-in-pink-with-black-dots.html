            <li>I love this straightener I paid 159 at the mall</li>
            <li>Glad I did .</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s girlfriend purchased her set from a mall kiosk, and I fell in love with hers.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to buy it from Amazon....</li>
            <li>I brought thus iron because it was cute</li>
            <li>I love this..</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>would cost more than the item did.</li>

            <li>From day one I&#x27;ve fallen in love with these.</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing !!!</li>
            <li>Best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons I owned</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky straight and curls amazingly!</li>
            <li>and it still was fly away frizzy and not silky smooth and straight as it is with the PYT.</li>
            <li>Its slower to heat up, Doesnt make my hair nice &amp; straight, makes my clean hair super oily!!!</li>
            <li>Works great on natural hair..</li>
            <li>: the light weight makes it easier to use the iron and focus more on the hair.</li>
            <li>so good luck if they&#x27;re real and</li>
            <li>I love it works simply and great</li>
            <li>Just straightened it and it dosent \\&quot;glide\\&quot; as easily.</li>
            <li>So far SOO good :)</li>
            <li>I loved my Amica, it was super hot and would do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas this year and it worked and straightened my hair fine without leaving any frizz.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of positive</li>
            <li>This Flat iron was really awesome got REALLY hot .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same one works great for curling too</li>
            <li>It is another cheap product which doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny, smooth, there was no pulling involved.</li>
            <li>The material is cheap all around.</li>
            <li>Great product, will purchase another for myself in the future.</li>
            <li>I was worried since the price was so cheap, but it is the REAL thing!!!</li>
            <li>So far im pretty happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to curl with this iron, and I really like that the temperature is adjustable.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used it so many people told me that my hair looked great that it made me wish that I had purchased it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first PYT at a beauty supply store for a lot more money</li>
            <li>I was excited originally since my sister had one and it worked well</li>
            <li>and it comes right to my door!</li>
            <li>If so I want a full refund</li>
            <li>Shippin was fast and more affordable than the one in CHRISTINA MALL IN DELAWARE.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a good $40 flat iron.</li>
            <li>So I know PYT flat irons are good</li>
            <li>and I hardly ever do anything with my hair besides blow drying, but I was really impressed with the results that the hot guy demonstrated with this product&#x27;s straightening and curling abilities.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered!  </li>
            <li>and they were light weight and worked really well -</li>
            <li>I happen to think that it is worth it though.</li>
            <li>I love it so much and would recommend it for anyone with a desire for pin straight hair in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It also does waves and curls if you just twist your wrist and turn the curling iron in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light weight that I wonder if it might break easily, or if it will last.</li>
            <li>It worked right up until I had it for exactly one year.</li>
            <li>and he said it was originally 200), but I believe that it is worth the cost especially if you like to have fun with your hair!</li>
            <li>This is really impressive, because I didn&#x27;t have to use so much heat to dry my hair because I knew that the flat iron would really get it</li>
            <li>but we are both very very please</li>
            <li>going to be 60 this year but very healthy and active...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most money that I ever thought to spend on a pair of flat irons, and it was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I really like this straightener except it won&#x27;t stay hot!</li>
            <li>It was sooo pretty, exactly like the picture...</li>
            <li>first got this one</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Your hair will be soft and light after the use.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THESE!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many flat irons</li>
            <li>but it cracked fell on the floor ; Basic Maintenance wipe plates when cooled to keep clean and store it when not needed !</li>
            <li>I thought they were new since it said so in the description, only way I was able to tell</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine but have lots of it due to genetics...  </li>
            <li>but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li>With one pass through each section, my normally really frizzy-wavy hair is pin straight and glassy-textured.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast beyond belief.</li>
            <li>At the mall kiosk they were asking $149 then when I was ready to walk away</li>
            <li>it still has so much bounce</li>
            <li>Using this really helps my hair eliminate frizzeys and keeps it shiny.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I know the life time card I got won&#x27;t work because I bought straighteners from pty themselves and the real cards have codes on them</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The hair turned out mostly straight with a bit of wave at the tip.</li>
            <li>I curled my naturally straight hair with it and the curls stayed in for hours until I straightened it out again in all of two minutes.</li>
            <li>The product is a bit on the pricey side (actually much cheaper here, I got it for 100</li>
            <li>Now my daughter uses it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The PYT straight iron was our compromise.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves my hair feeling soft and it looks so shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The plastic provides light insulation - although it can still get pretty hot when pressing it down between my fingers.</li>
            <li>the pink and black polka dots sold me it a good iron gets my hair very straight</li>
            <li>Switching from my old straightener you could see a huge different.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous tool that doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I got it at a mall kiosk, but this flatiron is so much easier to use than my old CHI.  </li>
            <li>It heats up within about 30 seconds unlike most straighteners that require you to wait for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>So overall, this was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Glides right through my hair and next thing</li>
            <li>But whenever they go, I&#x27;ll be right back on-line to purchase another set!</li>
            <li>I would say this is good if you have normal hair just not coarse thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>st Brooklyn ny 11206\\&quot; which is 2 blocks away from Where I live...  </li>
            <li>Like if the pyt company is 2 blocks from Where I live which is</li>
            <li>but now I have to pay to return a brand new item.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and to do this</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t help but wonder if I just need to buy a new ceramic iron every couple of years.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT think this was new.</li>
            <li>Big difference from the first $149 price</li>
            <li>The PYT iron gives my hair lots of body and enhances the natural luster!  </li>
            <li>Makes my natural hair look silky and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>It left my hair extremely shiny and soft, and super straight without any product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and shinny everything we want basically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far</li>
            <li>her hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>straightener works well compared to my old ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky because of the far-infrared heat that the ceramic plates creates, as per the product description.</li>
            <li>u have to be a professional to make curls.</li>
            <li>This product was a Christmas gift to my 13 yr old daughter who specifically requested this item.  </li>
            <li>good sorry for the language</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but don&#x27;t pay $100 for short, dead hair!</li>
            <li>This product takes twice as long to straighen and will not curl very well.</li>
            <li>The hair was straight all week as long as you wrap it every night.</li>
            <li>I noticed after beginning to use it, my hairstyle consistently got shorter at each hair appt due to damage.</li>
            <li>i love the pty hair straightener like at first my hair was a big poofy mess!!!!!</li>
            <li>With my old straightener, I had to go over and over and over the same section</li>
            <li>but I am african american with natural hair</li>
            <li>if your smart you can talk them down the box said $200 i paid $137 if your in MD</li>

            <li> I was worried since the price was so cheap, but it is the REAL thing!!!</li>
            <li> So far im pretty happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to curl with this iron, and I really like that the temperature is adjustable.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used it so many people told me that my hair looked great that it made me wish that I had purchased it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first PYT at a beauty supply store for a lot more money</li>
            <li> I was excited originally since my sister had one and it worked well</li>
            <li> and it comes right to my door!</li>
            <li> If so I want a full refund</li>
            <li> Shippin was fast and more affordable than the one in CHRISTINA MALL IN DELAWARE.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a good $40 flat iron.</li>
            <li> So I know PYT flat irons are good</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever do anything with my hair besides blow drying, but I was really impressed with the results that the hot guy demonstrated with this product&#x27;s straightening and curling abilities.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered!  </li>
            <li> and they were light weight and worked really well -</li>
            <li> I happen to think that it is worth it though.</li>
            <li> I love it so much and would recommend it for anyone with a desire for pin straight hair in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also does waves and curls if you just twist your wrist and turn the curling iron in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light weight that I wonder if it might break easily, or if it will last.</li>
            <li> It worked right up until I had it for exactly one year.</li>
            <li> and he said it was originally 200), but I believe that it is worth the cost especially if you like to have fun with your hair!</li>
            <li> This is really impressive, because I didn&#x27;t have to use so much heat to dry my hair because I knew that the flat iron would really get it</li>
            <li> but we are both very very please</li>
            <li> going to be 60 this year but very healthy and active...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most money that I ever thought to spend on a pair of flat irons, and it was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I really like this straightener except it won&#x27;t stay hot!</li>
            <li> It was sooo pretty, exactly like the picture...</li>
            <li> first got this one</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be soft and light after the use.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THESE!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many flat irons</li>
            <li> but it cracked fell on the floor ; Basic Maintenance wipe plates when cooled to keep clean and store it when not needed !</li>
            <li> I thought they were new since it said so in the description, only way I was able to tell</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine but have lots of it due to genetics...  </li>
            <li> but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li> With one pass through each section, my normally really frizzy-wavy hair is pin straight and glassy-textured.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast beyond belief.</li>
            <li> At the mall kiosk they were asking $149 then when I was ready to walk away</li>
            <li> it still has so much bounce</li>
            <li> Using this really helps my hair eliminate frizzeys and keeps it shiny.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I know the life time card I got won&#x27;t work because I bought straighteners from pty themselves and the real cards have codes on them</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The hair turned out mostly straight with a bit of wave at the tip.</li>
            <li> I curled my naturally straight hair with it and the curls stayed in for hours until I straightened it out again in all of two minutes.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit on the pricey side (actually much cheaper here, I got it for 100</li>
            <li> Now my daughter uses it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The PYT straight iron was our compromise.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves my hair feeling soft and it looks so shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The plastic provides light insulation - although it can still get pretty hot when pressing it down between my fingers.</li>
            <li> the pink and black polka dots sold me it a good iron gets my hair very straight</li>
            <li> Switching from my old straightener you could see a huge different.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous tool that doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got it at a mall kiosk, but this flatiron is so much easier to use than my old CHI.  </li>
            <li> It heats up within about 30 seconds unlike most straighteners that require you to wait for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So overall, this was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Glides right through my hair and next thing</li>
            <li> But whenever they go, I&#x27;ll be right back on-line to purchase another set!</li>
            <li> I would say this is good if you have normal hair just not coarse thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> st Brooklyn ny 11206\\&quot; which is 2 blocks away from Where I live...  </li>
            <li> Like if the pyt company is 2 blocks from Where I live which is</li>
            <li> but now I have to pay to return a brand new item.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and to do this</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t help but wonder if I just need to buy a new ceramic iron every couple of years.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT think this was new.</li>
            <li> Big difference from the first $149 price</li>
            <li> The PYT iron gives my hair lots of body and enhances the natural luster!  </li>
            <li> Makes my natural hair look silky and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> It left my hair extremely shiny and soft, and super straight without any product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and shinny everything we want basically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far</li>
            <li> her hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> straightener works well compared to my old ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky because of the far-infrared heat that the ceramic plates creates, as per the product description.</li>
            <li> u have to be a professional to make curls.</li>
            <li> This product was a Christmas gift to my 13 yr old daughter who specifically requested this item.  </li>
            <li> good sorry for the language</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but don&#x27;t pay $100 for short, dead hair!</li>
            <li> This product takes twice as long to straighen and will not curl very well.</li>
            <li> The hair was straight all week as long as you wrap it every night.</li>
            <li> I noticed after beginning to use it, my hairstyle consistently got shorter at each hair appt due to damage.</li>
            <li> i love the pty hair straightener like at first my hair was a big poofy mess!!!!!</li>
            <li> With my old straightener, I had to go over and over and over the same section</li>
            <li> but I am african american with natural hair</li>
            <li> if your smart you can talk them down the box said $200 i paid $137 if your in MD</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get my coarse naturally curly hair as shiny as my other irons.</li>
            <li> I saw some differences as the pyt on the flat iron is red and not white like the others I&#x27;ve seen and from what I&#x27;ve seen in pictures online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron last month for about $40.</li>
            <li> I do not think this is the same flat iron.</li>
            <li> With one pass this takes my hair from frizz to flat and with one simple twist I have bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes when I would flat iron my hair prior to owing my PYT flat irons</li>
            <li> But when straightening a section of hair with her flat iron, and a section with this one..</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron today</li>
            <li> the flat iron is defective send a money order of 22.70 for shipping costs and flat iron to 300 meserole</li>
            <li> The flat iron has a \\&quot;new\\&quot; smell to it</li>
            <li> this flat iron works so f*ing</li>
            <li> but I swear by these flat irons.</li>
            <li> So these flat irons are miracle workers I wish I could post pics of the results on here.</li>
            <li> I have been curling my hair with a flat iron for years</li>
            <li> Spend the money on a flat iron with titanium plates.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with curly, thick and stubborn hair, like mine ;)</li>
            <li> I was walking past a mall kiosk when a hot guy with a foreign accent approached me and started playing with my hair...</li>
            <li> I have used it when the hair was a little damp and the hair came out feather soft with the argon oil on it.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to flat iron and curl my hair in just about seven minutes cutting my process down to twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> I liked the straightener but was disappointed because it said that it came with the life time warranty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be careful not to hold the iron too long in one spot.</li>
            <li> Its not extra course or thick, but before I would have to straighten it out and then go over it a second time a day later</li>
            <li> I understand now that it does come down to the warranty or not having one which makes the price so different.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair so dry and brittle!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: my sister in law found her pamphlets and it says the exact same thing mines say so I was wrong on that.</li>
            <li> hair is past mid back and color treated.....</li>
            <li> Maybe the one they use at the mall for demos is stronger or different, but what i was sold, it is less than average flat iron.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, bought one previously from the mall,saved money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can wash and blow dry my hair and it only takes me 25 mins (where it would usually take 2 hours) to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Both are ceramic and I set both at the same 400 degree temperature, so I really am not sure what makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other one took forever to heat up</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly Lon hair and has been asking to have it chemically straightened.  </li>
            <li> B0055PJ29A PYT Ceramic 1.25 Hair Straightener in Pink with Black Dots]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I ordered the pink one with black polka dots, however, I was sent the snow leopard</li>
            <li> the only negative thing is that it snags my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go to arundel mills my friend manged to talk to people at the stand in arundel mills down to 105 for heres</li>
            <li> , she uses it almost eveRy day, she jumped up n down when she saw unwrapped it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months and already the plates are wearing down.</li>
            <li> but she has it in all black and bought it at a kiosk.</li>
            <li> black and my hair is about shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> The guy did my hair in less than 5 minted.</li>
            <li> every time I use them I always wonder what made the person who previously had them, want to sell them.</li>
            <li> It typically takes me at least a half an hour to forty five minutes to blow dry and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> The only issue with this flat iron is that it is on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> but they just kept breaking down!</li>
            <li> Dont waste time or money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the PYT hair straightener.</li>
            <li> was a few paint chippings.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had the straightener for a year, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed it slowly goin down hill.</li>
            <li> When I found them on amazon, I was skeptical because of the big price difference, but I purchased them anyway.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> and it fell off a small table onto the carpet and both ceramic plates broke.</li>
            <li> but I read some other comments on here that had me nervous to buy them and some ppl were saying they might be fake a downgraded version,defective etc.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I&#x27;m NOT a girl-y girl</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that theres no warranty</li>
            <li> Refurbished in a bad way because it does not work properly.</li>
            <li> When I decided to test it myself, the item that I bought will heat up fast but the quality of curls is very bad.</li>
            <li> waste of  money!!!</li>
            <li> It is beyond frustrating.</li>
            <li> and I never got worse curls than with PYT.</li>
            <li> I randomly decided to look up the straightener online</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake</li>
            <li> They are expensive</li>
            <li> crazy cause</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that they would charge for something that wasn&#x27;t my fault.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, and then this piece of crap PYT straightener is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this straightener except it won&#x27;t stay hot! I thought it was a fluke so I returned this one to get another,  same thing. It  will not stay warm for me to even do 1/4 of my hair.  It is beyond frustrating.</li>
            <li> This straightener was bought to replace my Chi and it is awesome! LOVE IT! I would recommend it to anyone with curly, thick and stubborn hair, like mine ;)</li>
            <li> Saw this at a mall kiosk and were offering it to me for $120. The lowest the lady went was $60 but I didn&#x27;t have the money at the time. I randomly decided to look up the straightener online and what do you know, Amazon had it! And for waaaaaay cheaper! The straightener looks and feels exactly like the one at the mall and works so good! Only bad thing is that theres no warranty but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li> The one I saw and tried at mall kiosk was much much better than this one . This one won&#x27;t heat up at all and I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I love it works simply and great</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron last month for about $40. My roommate had the one from the kiosk when we were in college. So when I recieved mine. It was sooo pretty, exactly like the picture... But better. It looks identical to hers. But when straightening a section of hair with her flat iron, and a section with this one.. I do not think this is the same flat iron. My roommates had provided my hair with a shine/luster. The PYT from amazon... Just straightened it and it dosent \\&quot;glide\\&quot; as easily. I do not think this is legit PYT despite the identical appearance. But it&#x27;s still a good $40 flat iron.</li>
            <li> I should tell you I DID NOT get this flatiron from this company, so I don&#x27;t know whether the one they are selling here is used.  I got it at a mall kiosk, but this flatiron is so much easier to use than my old CHI.  With one pass through each section, my normally really frizzy-wavy hair is pin straight and glassy-textured.  It also does waves and curls if you just twist your wrist and turn the curling iron in the right direction.  It&#x27;s like I had a keratin treatment!</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron today and I examined it and compared it to my sister in laws pyt but she has it in all black and bought it at a kiosk. I saw some differences as the pyt on the flat iron is red and not white like the others I&#x27;ve seen and from what I&#x27;ve seen in pictures online. Everything else is spot on except mine came with a couple scratches. I also noticed on the pamphlet it comes with that it states \\&quot;if the flat iron is defective send a money order of 22.70 for shipping costs and flat iron to 300 meserole st Brooklyn ny 11206\\&quot; which is 2 blocks away from Where I live...  Like if the pyt company is 2 blocks from Where I live which is crazy cause I lived here for 4 years. I&#x27;ll just have to see how it performs. I&#x27;m kind of positive it&#x27;s a fake but we&#x27;ll just see. If so I want a full refund or I&#x27;ll just throw it in the trash. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: my sister in law found her pamphlets and it says the exact same thing mines say so I was wrong on that. The flat iron has a \\&quot;new\\&quot; smell to it so I know it isnt used. So far im pretty happy. Still haven&#x27;t tried it out but I&#x27;ll let you kow again on another update. Shipping was fast beyond belief. I received it in 3 days from date of purchase! So far SOO good :)</li>
            <li> I had an Amica styler that I was exchanging. They changed hands to PYT. I loved my Amica, it was super hot and would do anything to my hair. This product takes twice as long to straighen and will not curl very well. I miss my Amica. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener at the mall last year and dropped it I love this straightener I paid 159 at the mall never again I will always go to Amazon first got this one and it&#x27;s the same one works great for curling too</li>
            <li> Do appreciate the prices you can get compared to at the mall.  Over 50% savings, and it comes right to my door!</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! Works with one pass and curls your hair nicely . At the mall kiosk they were asking $149 then when I was ready to walk away they offered it up for $99! It still thought that was a lot so I decided to come home &amp; do some research before buying ! Glad I did . Amazing they are going for around $50-$60 . I bought mine off groupon.com for Only $29.99!! Big difference from the first $149 price</li>
            <li> Glides right through my hair and next thing I know I&#x27;m done! It&#x27;s heats up quick and the curls come out great</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend purchased her set from a mall kiosk, and I fell in love with hers.  When I found them on amazon, I was skeptical because of the big price difference, but I purchased them anyway.  I understand now that it does come down to the warranty or not having one which makes the price so different.  But as for the performance, my irons work just the same as my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  I&#x27;m african-american with a mixed hair texture.  The PYT iron gives my hair lots of body and enhances the natural luster!  It&#x27;s the most money that I ever thought to spend on a pair of flat irons, and it was well worth the investment.  I&#x27;ve owned these irons for 3 months now and hope they last for awhile.  But whenever they go, I&#x27;ll be right back on-line to purchase another set!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  With one pass this takes my hair from frizz to flat and with one simple twist I have bouncy curls.  This flat iron leaves my hair feeling soft and it looks so shiny and healthy.  The first time that I used it so many people told me that my hair looked great that it made me wish that I had purchased it a long time ago.  It works so well that even my husband noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m black and my hair is about shoulder length.  It typically takes me at least a half an hour to forty five minutes to blow dry and straighten my hair but I was able to flat iron and curl my hair in just about seven minutes cutting my process down to twenty minutes.  This is really impressive, because I didn&#x27;t have to use so much heat to dry my hair because I knew that the flat iron would really get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to curl with this iron, and I really like that the temperature is adjustable. The only issue with this flat iron is that it is on the expensive side.  I happen to think that it is worth it though.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I ordered the pink one with black polka dots, however, I was sent the snow leopard one.. But it does work AMAZING!! Would reccomend to anyone who straightens their hair, would definitely buy this again if mine was to ever break! Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> I tried so many flat irons and I wish I knew the names of them all to tell you all not to waist your money but I am african american with natural hair haven&#x27;t had any creamy crack (relaxer or perm) in my hair since 05 and sometimes I want my hair streight with out having to resort to using any chemicals. OMGGGGGGG this flat iron works so f*ing good sorry for the language but I swear by these flat irons. Now I was going to buy them from this website but I read some other comments on here that had me nervous to buy them and some ppl were saying they might be fake a downgraded version,defective etc. etc. so i did get mines from the mall with  the 5 year warranty. I used them once and all honesty you would&#x27;ve thought I did get a perm or something....So these flat irons are miracle workers I wish I could post pics of the results on here. Before and after or somthing. They are expensive I got mines form Montgomery mall in MD at the stand of course if your smart you can talk them down the box said $200 i paid $137 if your in MD I&#x27;d go to arundel mills my friend manged to talk to people at the stand in arundel mills down to 105 for heres :/ but we are both very very please oh and sometimes when I would flat iron my hair prior to owing my PYT flat irons it my wrap didn&#x27;t come out good at all but with these after i use them and wrap my hair it still has so much bounce it&#x27;s soft and shinny everything we want basically. So I know PYT flat irons are good but I don&#x27;t know about buying them here online...so good luck if they&#x27;re real and everything mines are you&#x27;ll be very pleased and I&#x27;m not the type of person that leaves reviews but i had to with these ones.</li>
            <li> Bought second one for a bday gift! She loveeeddd it , she uses it almost eveRy day, she jumped up n down when she saw unwrapped it</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing !!! It does a great job !! &amp;&amp; I absolutely love the price I paid for it !!</li>
            <li> We read the reviews before deciding to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;So far no complaints.  We&#x27;ve had real good luck and my daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The color is great.</li>
            <li> Works great on natural hair.. Seals ends</li>
            <li> Bought this at a kiosk in the mall for their Discounted Price of $100 cash..  Would have bought from Amazon at the cheaper price had I known they sold it.  Will always check before buying anything since I have Amazon Prime.  Best deals and very happy with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is past mid back and color treated.....going to be 60 this year but very healthy and active...  My hair is very fine but have lots of it due to genetics...  Plus use coconut shampoo and cream rinses along with argon oils....  Using this really helps my hair eliminate frizzeys and keeps it shiny.  Try it and see if you like it.  I do use a curling iron also to gets the ends shaped better but very happy with this product.  Just be sure to buy it from Amazon....</li>
            <li> It works great I was happy to find one I broke mine and had to buy a replacement quick. Thanks</li>
            <li> Best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> I brought thus iron because it was cute the pink and black polka dots sold me it a good iron gets my hair very straight the only negative thing is that it snags my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great and leaves my hair looking so beautiful!! I was worried since the price was so cheap, but it is the REAL thing!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the HERSTYLER more. This doesn&#x27;t get my coarse naturally curly hair as shiny as my other irons. I would say this is good if you have normal hair just not coarse thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love ! Bought on from the mall and gave it away to my mom! Then seen the price of this and couldn&#x27;t resists ! The curling wand is a must have as well !!</li>
            <li> I love this iron! It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! It leaves my hair silky straight and curls amazingly! And for a great price?!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous tool that doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out your hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product, 450 degree very nice</li>
            <li> works as decribed, wife loves it because, her hair doesnt smell like burned when using product.&lt;br /&gt;leaves her hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I liked the straightener but was disappointed because it said that it came with the life time warranty but it didn&#x27;t the card didn&#x27;t have a code on it so all in all it said the straighter came with things it didn&#x27;t and I know the life time card I got won&#x27;t work because I bought straighteners from pty themselves and the real cards have codes on them</li>
            <li> I bought my PYT straightener at a mall kiosk and paid $89.99 plus tax. It came with a separately packaged stand that can be mounted with screws or affixed with suction cups and a &amp;#34;lifetime warranty&amp;#34; that is supposedly a $39.99 value. The lifetime warranty card says that it is void if purchased by unauthorized sellers on Amazon or eBay, so that could be why some reviewers say their purchase price did not include the lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener works well compared to my old ceramic straightener. With the PYT, I can straighten a section of my coarse, defiant and frizzy hair with one pass. With my old straightener, I had to go over and over and over the same section and it still was fly away frizzy and not silky smooth and straight as it is with the PYT. Both are ceramic and I set both at the same 400 degree temperature, so I really am not sure what makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful not to hold the iron too long in one spot. Keep the iron moving or you will scorch and damage your hair. I scorched a section of mine and now it is brittle and  developing split ends there.</li>
            <li> I love this.. My other one took forever to heat up and then I would have to go over and over my hair with it.. Thanks</li>
            <li> This Flat iron was really awesome got REALLY hot . One of the best flat irons I owned but it cracked fell on the floor ; Basic Maintenance wipe plates when cooled to keep clean and store it when not needed !</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had the straightener for a year, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed it slowly goin down hill. Its slower to heat up, Doesnt make my hair nice &amp; straight, makes my clean hair super oily!!! waste of  money!!! Never trusting sales ppl in the middle of the mall again</li>
            <li> It is another cheap product which doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to do. Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; does a great job on my hair !!</li>
            <li> I just bought mine at the mall. The guy did my hair in less than 5 minted. My hair looked shiny, smooth, there was no pulling involved. Well, i paid $100 and went home happy. When I decided to test it myself, the item that I bought will heat up fast but the quality of curls is very bad. Cannot be compared with what the demo guy did. The hair turned out mostly straight with a bit of wave at the tip. I have been curling my hair with a flat iron for years and I never got worse curls than with PYT. I will return it ASAP because it does not deliver. Maybe the one they use at the mall for demos is stronger or different, but what i was sold, it is less than average flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was walking past a mall kiosk when a hot guy with a foreign accent approached me and started playing with my hair...I was sold! Seriously though, I&#x27;m NOT a girl-y girl and I hardly ever do anything with my hair besides blow drying, but I was really impressed with the results that the hot guy demonstrated with this product&#x27;s straightening and curling abilities. I decided to try it out and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky because of the far-infrared heat that the ceramic plates creates, as per the product description. I curled my naturally straight hair with it and the curls stayed in for hours until I straightened it out again in all of two minutes. It heats up within about 30 seconds unlike most straighteners that require you to wait for a few minutes. The product is a bit on the pricey side (actually much cheaper here, I got it for 100 and he said it was originally 200), but I believe that it is worth the cost especially if you like to have fun with your hair!</li>
            <li> I love it! It is the best straightener I have ever used. I bought my first PYT at a beauty supply store for a lot more money so I was very happy!!</li>
            <li> One of the plates are falling out of the iron!</li>
            <li> Arrived in 3 days. Love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I was promised shampoo and conditioner u have to be a professional to make curls. Dont waste time or money</li>
            <li> i love the pty hair straightener like at first my hair was a big poofy mess!!!!! and now it is silky and straight&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0055PJ29A PYT Ceramic 1.25 Hair Straightener in Pink with Black Dots]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it i think everyone should have it.</li>
            <li> Switching from my old straightener you could see a huge different. I love it so much and would recommend it for anyone with a desire for pin straight hair in about 10 minutes. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the PYT hair straightener. It says it&#x27;s made of 100% ceramic plates, but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months and already the plates are wearing down. They look and feel like plastic. Also, the customer service for PYT is horrendous. You can&#x27;t order their products from their website,  yet they deny owning any of the mall kiosks that sell them. So if you ever want to return it, you can&#x27;t. And at those mall kiosks, they overprice the straighteners, so I ended up buying mine for around $130, instead of the $30 I could have paid if I bought it from Amazon. But if I could go back in time, I wouldn&#x27;t even pay $5 for it. It&#x27;s not quality at all. The material is cheap all around. Spend the money on a flat iron with titanium plates. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, and then this piece of crap PYT straightener is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, bought one previously from the mall,saved money with this purchase. Works great. Because I&#x27;ve had a PYT before knew the kind of product I was getting,my expectations were met!!! I would order another from this seller!</li>
            <li> I bought one and the power cord is faulty. I was excited originally since my sister had one and it worked well but now I have to pay to return a brand new item. I live in the Caribbean and to do this would cost more than the item did. I am really disappointed that they would charge for something that wasn&#x27;t my fault.</li>
            <li> This product was a Christmas gift to my 13 yr old daughter who specifically requested this item.  She absolutely loves it!  Two of her friends have this straightener and told her it was the best of the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener. It&#x27;s so light weight that I wonder if it might break easily, or if it will last. I remember, a number of years ago, buying Gold ceramic and they were light weight and worked really well - but they just kept breaking down! I hope pyt doesn&#x27;t do that. Supposedly, it has a lifetime guarantee and a one year warranty.  Other than that: the light weight makes it easier to use the iron and focus more on the hair. The plastic provides light insulation - although it can still get pretty hot when pressing it down between my fingers. The ceramic is definitely good quality and the plates are well made. It left my hair extremely shiny and soft, and super straight without any product.  I didn&#x27;t need to go over the hair multiple times, even at low temperatures. I just smoothed it through once, and in more difficult areas - the crown - twice. So overall, this was definitely worth the price. Although I can&#x27;t help but wonder if I just need to buy a new ceramic iron every couple of years. PYT is great, but yeah, ceramic does wear out/off, I think.  These are being sold at the mall for $200, though. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> I had to order this, my sister have one and it is a winner. Makes my natural hair look silky and it is very soft. Now my daughter uses it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This straightener was purchased for my daughter who used the one I already purchased.  This straightener works wonderful on the hair with argon oil.  Your hair will be soft and light after the use.  I have used it when the hair was a little damp and the hair came out feather soft with the argon oil on it.  The hair was straight all week as long as you wrap it every night. Great product, will purchase another for myself in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas this year and it worked and straightened my hair fine without leaving any frizz.  I didn&#x27;t even have it for a month and it fell off a small table onto the carpet and both ceramic plates broke. I was very disappointed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending this kind of money on this product.</li>
            <li> It work great&lt;br /&gt;Love what make my hair bright with my hair dyed&lt;br /&gt;Work great&lt;br /&gt;Still working on curling but it work amazing getting a lot of your hair looks great complements</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly Lon hair and has been asking to have it chemically straightened.  The PYT straight iron was our compromise.  Both of us are extremely happy with the product. She gets straight hair a few times a week without permanent damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener at a mall an it&#x27;s awful! It has made my hair so dry and brittle! Buy a CHI, they are the best</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up properly. The paint is scratched. I DO NOT think this was new. I think it is used and refurbished.  Refurbished in a bad way because it does not work properly.</li>
            <li> Shippin was fast and more affordable than the one in CHRISTINA MALL IN DELAWARE. Exactly what I ordered!  Get one I love it. Works as good as the expense ones</li>
            <li> From day one I&#x27;ve fallen in love with these. I thought they were new since it said so in the description, only way I was able to tell was a few paint chippings. But they are really great even if they are second-hand and every time I use them I always wonder what made the person who previously had them, want to sell them. I use them maybe 1 or 2 a week. I can wash and blow dry my hair and it only takes me 25 mins (where it would usually take 2 hours) to straighten my hair. Its not extra course or thick, but before I would have to straighten it out and then go over it a second time a day later and then again a day later to get the results. But with these, I can set aside 25 mins to straighten my hair and be done with it. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THESE!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron from a mall kiosk. It worked right up until I had it for exactly one year. I am thankful that it crapped out because it was chewing up my hair. I noticed after beginning to use it, my hairstyle consistently got shorter at each hair appt due to damage. It&#x27;s cute but don&#x27;t pay $100 for short, dead hair!</li>
