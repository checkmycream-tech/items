            <li>I t is the best product I have used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Very good size definitely need to use a lot of it though otherwise hair will be frizzy</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and I love the light scent.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine ear lobe length hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Mousse isn&#x27;t sticky on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this stuff is fantastic</li>
            <li>I am gluten free and this product seems to work.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I bought some for home.</li>
            <li>Love the application, that I don&#x27;t have to put it in my hands first.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of adding volume for fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>Not as great as other Aquage products.</li>
            <li>This is a foam mousse which gives great volume to thin or fine hair, as well as adding a touch of the most wonderfully clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice lift to flat hair.</li>
            <li>Gives me the right amount of hold without being gummy.</li>
            <li>So decided to purchase this large bottle - Nice and fluffy and strong holding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many similar products.  </li>
            <li>My beautician used it first on my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this whole line of products.</li>
            <li>I have fine, hard to manage hair and this mousse works great to give it body and control with a natural feel all day long.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this product after I told her how many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Up All Night gives texture to my fine, salt/pepper hair which is cut in long layers to a length just below the earlobes.&lt;br /&gt;There is no objectionable coating on my hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used aquage volume mousse for several years but first time to try the All Night mousse.</li>
            <li>This is the only mousse that actually provides true volume.</li>
            <li>Not stiff</li>
            <li>All Night\\&quot; held my style all day, was not stiff, and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Really gives my fine, thin hair body without a gummy or unnatural feeling.</li>
            <li>I have super thin straight hair that will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li>and I like it narrow flow so that it get right to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have found no other product that has the same results as this one.</li>
            <li>I live in DC and the humidity doesn&#x27;t seen to cause much issues (a few days when everyone had issues, but that&#x27;s everyone!).  </li>

            <li> I can simply put this product in after my shower, brush through and blow dry with my round brush and go.  </li>

            <li> this product left my hair feeling heavy and with a dull coating.</li>
            <li> It holds all day without feeling dry or hard and, if I want to pull half my hair up I can without showing my scalp.</li>
            <li> Product a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating to spend nearly $20.00 when product doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> it adds firmness to my hair but does not leave it feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> Not any noticeable volume, little disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> I wish it were not so expensive though...</li>

            <li> Great product for giving you body.  Even if it gets on your clothes it does not stain.</li>
            <li> This is a foam mousse which gives great volume to thin or fine hair, as well as adding a touch of the most wonderfully clean fragrance.  I like that it adds firmness to my hair but does not leave it feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...... One of the few that really works.</li>
            <li> Very good size definitely need to use a lot of it though otherwise hair will be frizzy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product after I told her how many other products I have tried. I have baby fine ear lobe length hair. I can simply put this product in after my shower, brush through and blow dry with my round brush and go.  It holds all day without feeling dry or hard and, if I want to pull half my hair up I can without showing my scalp. Because my hair roots now stand away from my scalp it also keeps me cooler too.  I live in DC and the humidity doesn&#x27;t seen to cause much issues (a few days when everyone had issues, but that&#x27;s everyone!).  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am gluten free and this product seems to work.  I would recommend it for anyone who has the same problem I have.</li>
            <li> The best volume foam I&#x27;ve found on the market. A little goes a long way. A friend told me to try it, I&#x27;ve been sold on it ever since.</li>
            <li> Great product. Well priced. Gives me the right amount of hold without being gummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used aquage volume mousse for several years but first time to try the All Night mousse. I have fine hair and this stuff is fantastic</li>
            <li> Product a waste of money. I have baby fine hair. My hair wouldn&#x27;t hold any curl at all when using it.  Very frustrating to spend nearly $20.00 when product doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products.  This is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Works to keep my curls or pull them out.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the use of the Aquage Biomega Volume Mousse, it holds well and I like it narrow flow so that it get right to the scalp.</li>

            <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Mousse isn&#x27;t sticky on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> would not purchase again. this product left my hair feeling heavy and with a dull coating. May work well for others but not me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Gives you the style you want without feeling like you glued your hair.  Not stiff but it will stay.</li>
            <li> Up All Night gives texture to my fine, salt/pepper hair which is cut in long layers to a length just below the earlobes.&lt;br /&gt;There is no objectionable coating on my hair and I can run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Everything perfect about transaction.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size from my hairstylist yesterday and LOVE this product! I have soft, thick, white/gray hair and \\&quot;Up All Night\\&quot; held my style all day, was not stiff, and the smell is not overpowering. I wish it were not so expensive though...</li>
            <li> Love this volume foam!!!  Makes my fine hair more manageable.  I really like this whole line of products. The conditioner is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does work. I actually had some volume to my hair. What I did not like about it was it left my hair feeling, I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. It wasn&#x27;t heavy. My hair wasn&#x27;t tangled or anything like that. I could not run my fingers thru my hair. Almost sticky, but not really. I have super thin straight hair that will not hold a curl. With this in it held a wave from my curling iron. I didn&#x27;t like the fact I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers thru my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, hard to manage hair and this mousse works great to give it body and control with a natural feel all day long.  It leaves my hair shiny and I love the light scent.  My beautician used it first on my hair and I liked it so much I bought some for home.</li>

            <li> This is one of the best mousse products I&#x27;ve tried when it comes to body and hold. It&#x27;s a bit sticky on the hands but overall I like it and will keep purchasing. Sometimes I use it combined with a styling lotion for a smoother look but while still maintaining the body. The price is a little lower through Amazon than at my old salon so it saved me a trip.</li>
            <li> Tried a small sample bottle from my local salon.  So decided to purchase this large bottle - Nice and fluffy and strong holding.</li>

            <li> Spent a fortune on mousse only to trash them all. This is the only mousse that actually provides true volume. It&#x27;s a bit sticky when you blow out your hair but that means it works!  It gives a nice lift to flat hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
