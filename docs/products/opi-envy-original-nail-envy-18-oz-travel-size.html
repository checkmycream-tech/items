            <li>Maybe I just need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product makes my nails so strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I love this and the cute little bottle is perfect for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought the full size bottle!  </li>
            <li>My nails are soooooooo strong now.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t notice the damaging effects, or maybe I was unlucky and experienced something completely different.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast, and makes my nails really strong.  </li>
            <li>Since I love OPI nail envy the cute little container allows me to love it wherever I go.</li>
            <li>My nails would break so easily, so I would have to keep them trimmed really</li>
            <li>I am a repeat customer and will come back for more!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described and arrived rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I saw a blog post about how peeling and damaged nails can be repaired miraculously by using this polish, and after reading all the rave reviews on amazon, I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>Better luck next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that I was able to get a trail size.</li>
            <li>nails did look and feel much better immediately after a fresh painting of this polish, but I&#x27;m not willing to paint my nails every day to make them look and feel nicer, especially if long-term it&#x27;s making my nails more brittle.</li>
            <li>I love that they have such a tiny bottle, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Best used as a base coat, my favorite.</li>
            <li>It did make my nails stronger, but I have not seen much difference in nail growth.</li>
            <li>It has really helped them by strengthening them.</li>
            <li>wanted a little more length</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without this stuff</li>
            <li>In any case, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you&#x27;re willing to paint your nails with it every day for a very long period of time.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years - it is the best for bad nails!  </li>

            <li> I saw a blog post about how peeling and damaged nails can be repaired miraculously by using this polish, and after reading all the rave reviews on amazon, I bought it right away. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now and my nails have seen no improvement. In fact, they seem to be even weaker than they were before.&lt;br /&gt;My nails did look and feel much better immediately after a fresh painting of this polish, but I&#x27;m not willing to paint my nails every day to make them look and feel nicer, especially if long-term it&#x27;s making my nails more brittle. I don&#x27;t know why my experience was so different from the majority of other reviewers, maybe they&#x27;re actually using this every single day so they don&#x27;t notice the damaging effects, or maybe I was unlucky and experienced something completely different. In any case, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you&#x27;re willing to paint your nails with it every day for a very long period of time.</li>
            <li> It was alright. It did make my nails stronger, but I have not seen much difference in nail growth. Maybe I just need to give it more time. Pretty good product. The only reason I give it 4 is because I was hoping to see some nail growth and did not.</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect size for traveling. Wish all polished came in travel sizes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and arrived rather quickly.  I love that they have such a tiny bottle, easy to travel with.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is ok, Since its so small its actually difficult to get the polish on the brush, Couldn&#x27;t really tell if my nails were getting stronger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a tiny bottle but that&#x27;s fine, I bought it when I thought my big bottle had been lost, now I have found it I also keep the little travel sizenearby. The small brush is easier to control. Best used as a base coat, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product makes my nails so strong and healthy. I have tried every product and this has been the only that actually works! I don&#x27;t care how much it is I will buy this product again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this last month and this item is so small. I would never purchase again.  Better luck next time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years - it is the best for bad nails!  I am a repeat customer and will come back for more!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  You can feel that your nails are stronger the next day.  Follow the instructions - it is not meant to stay on for days and if you do leave it on for longer than 2-3 days your nails will turn and orangey color!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!!  I wish I had bought the full size bottle!  It dries very fast, and makes my nails really strong.  I will definately buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t used it everyday,  but I like it.  I especially like the fact that I was able to get a trail size.</li>
            <li> The best nail strengthener I&#x27;ve ever used!! My nails would break so easily, so I would have to keep them trimmed really short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a little more length so I decided to try this. I picked mine up at a local store. I absolutely love it!! My nails are soooooooo strong now. And I have the length I want because my nails aren&#x27;t breaking now!  I noticed a big difference after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone with weak nail issues. This can be worn alone or under polish.</li>
            <li> I dont know how I ever lived without this. It helps my nails grow faster and thicker. I love this and the cute little bottle is perfect for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best.  I have to buy another one.  This one is too small.</li>
            <li> I tried it because my nails were brittle and peeling from wearing acrylic nails. It has really helped them by strengthening them. I would recommend it. Im still using it</li>
            <li> I like to coat my nails at times when I travel and this is the tiniest bottle I have ever seen. It fits in with the small items in my luggage without taking up even a bit of space and allows me to bring on carry on due to it&#x27;s puny size. Since I love OPI nail envy the cute little container allows me to love it wherever I go.</li>
            <li> This bottle is tiny!!!</li>
