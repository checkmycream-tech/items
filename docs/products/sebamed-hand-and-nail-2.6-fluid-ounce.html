            <li>It has a thicker consistency and absorbs very nicely into your skin and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years and originally bought it at Costco.  </li>
            <li>I was really happy with hpw quick</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Love love love Seba Med products!</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried many brands of hand cream, this is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>Got on time and am satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li>And they look healthy and so does the skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>It is more watery and oilier than the authentic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more like a lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, excellent moisturizer and healing to rough cuticles.  </li>
            <li>We just love the entire Seba Med line, but this hand/nail cream is the best.</li>
            <li>Made my nails nice too, huge plus for a hand cream.</li>
            <li>but the store sent me one more time</li>
            <li>I use band-aids to help keep the blood from getting on paperwork, groceries or most anything that I come in contact with.  </li>
            <li>Smooths out the skin on my hands perfectly when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my fingers look great and has completely eliminated hang nails.</li>
            <li>The moisture it provides is perfect without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>This helps to keep your hands skin smooth and nails shinny.</li>
            <li>Was excited to try this out as I am already a senamed fan.</li>
            <li>It absorbed as easy as DHC&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this goes on without feeling greasy and absorbes quickly leaving your hands feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>This one is moderately priced and seems to be good from its lab research focus.</li>
            <li>If I do get a cut, it heals up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought it at Costco, normally I got it in Europe, it is German pharmacy staple, and a brand trusted for decades, happy to see it in the US, here on amazon.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 40 years I have fingernails!</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that lets my nails grow strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>dry skin turns nice and smooth without any discomfort like itching or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Sebamed hand and body lotion, so was hoping this would work great on my dry nails &amp; cuticles as I live in the high desert.</li>
            <li>I have no cuts right now.  </li>
            <li>Not only are the ingredients healthy for us, but the cream is soothing, soaks in quickly and does not leave any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen a difference from a regular good hand cream like the Cetaphil cream.  </li>
            <li>In winter, I will go back to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream, a great moisturizer for hands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still ok but different from when i purchased it at Costco.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think I&#x27;ll use up the rest of my tube and then not repurchase, as this just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>my hands started to improve even just after the first application.</li>
            <li>As soon as one cut closes up, it seems that three more break open.  </li>
            <li>You have made my life a whole lot sweeter!</li>
            <li>her hands didn&#x27;t seem to heal up anymore quickly than with other lotions/creams that have a better smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Costco for introducing me to it.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, I LOVE how quickly it sinks into my skin, making my hands moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>But in reality you can go to CVS market and get just as much qualtity and quantity from leading brands .</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing, not greasy, not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real Sebamed Hand and Nail lotion is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It is a lotion, absorbs fast, but nurishes like a cream.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever really helped.  </li>
            <li>The pain is very distracting as well.  </li>
            <li>IT works better than any other hand lotion I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it and for regular dry hands</li>
            <li>Sebamed was more watery and less creamy.</li>
            <li>It is ok for summer, but not adequate for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel terrific.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in, my hands are smoother and I can work at my computer without washing my hands first!</li>
            <li>Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting to be able to wash my hands a hundred times before my skin gets dry again, but I had to reapply this cream to my hands after each wash.</li>
            <li>One on my left hand, one on my right.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely strong parfume that I have trouble tolerating.</li>
            <li>Love this company and its every product, from hard cream to baby products.</li>
            <li>This cream protect mine very nicely so far.</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that has worked nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I happen to wash them frequently</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin on my hands and get many hangnails; this balm takes care of both the dry skin and any other issues (like hangnails or rough</li>
            <li>Especially this cream goes on fast onto your hands, soaks in instantly and DOES NOT LEAVE GREASY RESIDUE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hand creams from more expensive brands, like Estee Lauder or Clarins, but thought why pay so much for a hand cream.</li>
            <li>But my hand w/ Sebamed quickly looked whitish and dried and felt that way too.</li>
            <li>Really does withstand multiple handwashings and really recommend this product, although a little pricey for handcream.</li>
            <li>It is quite upsetting when people see the condition of my hands, especially when they unexpectedly start to bleed.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a very odd texture, very watery like skim milk, and I would in no way call it a &amp;#34;balm.&amp;#34; It may be, in fact, quite moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t feel particularly emollient or protective.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, though, the smell is really off-putting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but it is worth it for people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is nice but a little thin for a hand cream.</li>

            <li> Not great but not bad.</li>

            <li> Recently I tried Sebamed Hand and Nail cream after discovering the benefits of the hair products (due to a rash).  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and addresses issue of dry hands.</li>
            <li> has stopped my itching and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I also like Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy, and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I wash hans very frequently due to my work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that&#x27;s supposed to help with the dryness</li>
            <li> This time it seems to be watered down</li>
            <li> I had bad exceema and this was mildly helpful.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, not much different compare to the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Although some people have said they like the smell, it is not appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> I prefer it to be a unscented one rather than a small of a cheep soap.</li>
            <li> Of course it depends how dry the skin is, but for mine works well, and I wash hands often, or I am guilty of not using gloves  for some chores.</li>
            <li> It takes a few applicationg before the moisturizer finally sticks and your hands aint too bad.</li>
            <li> Now I have to file them down!!!</li>
            <li> I made the dreadful mistake of getting a no chip manicure last year and it damaged my nails so badly that as my nails grew, they peeled to the quick.  </li>
            <li> Even with the care that I take, I have painful cracks all around my nails and on my fingertips all winter long.  </li>
            <li> It makes it very hard to work.  </li>
            <li> And the lotion is very thin.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid about this, how can happen?</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have a very painful hand condition during the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to mind scented products, but this just smelled bad to me (and to my roommate, who commented on the odor about 30 minutes after I had applied it - it lingers!).</li>

            <li> I have no idea why this cream is better than anything else I have purchased, but it is.  I have nails now.  And they look healthy and so does the skin on my hands.  I&#x27;ve over 50 and I&#x27;ve always had problems with my nails.  They are so much better when I use this cream!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream before and loved it. This time it seems to be watered down it&#x27;s still ok but different from when i purchased it at Costco.</li>
            <li> I am feeling ambivalent about this hand cream. On the plus side, I LOVE how quickly it sinks into my skin, making my hands moisturized but not greasy. On the other hand, though, the smell is really off-putting. I don&#x27;t tend to mind scented products, but this just smelled bad to me (and to my roommate, who commented on the odor about 30 minutes after I had applied it - it lingers!). I also felt that the moisture was not long-lasting. Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting to be able to wash my hands a hundred times before my skin gets dry again, but I had to reapply this cream to my hands after each wash. That was a hassle. I almost wonder if I got a bad batch or an expired product because everyone else has nothing but nice things to say about this lotion. Overall, I think I&#x27;ll use up the rest of my tube and then not repurchase, as this just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very strong scent.  Although some people have said they like the smell, it is not appealing to me.  And the lotion is very thin.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I had been told it does.  My daughter has very dry hands in the winter.  When she used this lotion, it burned when she put it on and her hands didn&#x27;t seem to heal up anymore quickly than with other lotions/creams that have a better smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent! All of my Sebamed products never disappoint. This stuff makes my fingers look great and has completely eliminated hang nails.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product. I LOVE the Sebamed hand and body lotion, so was hoping this would work great on my dry nails &amp; cuticles as I live in the high desert. So far I haven&#x27;t seen a difference from a regular good hand cream like the Cetaphil cream.  The scent is also a bit too perfumy for me.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. Not great but not bad.Has a nice smell to it and for regular dry hands this does a good job in helping you out. It takes a few applicationg before the moisturizer finally sticks and your hands aint too bad. But in reality you can go to CVS market and get just as much qualtity and quantity from leading brands . I had bad exceema and this was mildly helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a great value whn cosidering price on amazon and the quality of the product.  It is not greasy and addresses issue of dry hands.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing, not greasy, not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> works great.  no complaints.  dry skin turns nice and smooth without any discomfort like itching or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t tried it on nails nor do i plan to.  i use it on the back side of my hand.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Sebamed products for a while.&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped my itching and dry skin.  My wife also agrees.</li>
            <li> This product is a counterfeit.  It did not come sealed with the aluminum foil on the spout.  It is more watery and oilier than the authentic.&lt;br /&gt;The real Sebamed Hand and Nail lotion is not greasy at all.  It has a thicker consistency and absorbs very nicely into your skin and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years and originally bought it at Costco.  The lady warned me about purchasing it on Amazon.  She was right!  I&#x27;m upset that I now have to mail the product back to get my refund.  What a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best hand cream I ever use in my life.  I wash hans very frequently due to my work.  This cream protect mine very nicely so far.</li>
            <li> Love this company and its every product, from hard cream to baby products. Especially this cream goes on fast onto your hands, soaks in instantly and DOES NOT LEAVE GREASY RESIDUE. AWSOME</li>
            <li> This helps to keep your hands skin smooth and nails shinny. I use it every day as just a hand cream.</li>
            <li> This is nice but a little thin for a hand cream. It is more like a lotion.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hand creams from more expensive brands, like Estee Lauder or Clarins, but thought why pay so much for a hand cream. This one is moderately priced and seems to be good from its lab research focus. However, the result was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made some head to head comparisons to DHC Olive Hand Cream I was using. One on my left hand, one on my right. Sebamed was more watery and less creamy. It absorbed as easy as DHC&#x27;s. But my hand w/ Sebamed quickly looked whitish and dried and felt that way too. It is ok for summer, but not adequate for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that I will buy it again. In winter, I will go back to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream, a great moisturizer for hands. In the meanwhile, I will continue my hunt for a super-hand-cream that is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to be a unscented one rather than a small of a cheep soap. BTW, I don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, excellent moisturizer and healing to rough cuticles.  Also, has a good slip on the skin while applying to the hands.</li>
            <li> This is best hand cream ever!</li>
            <li> We just love the entire Seba Med line, but this hand/nail cream is the best. I have super dry skin on my hands and get many hangnails; this balm takes care of both the dry skin and any other issues (like hangnails or rough spots)like all git out!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin look healthier and my nails grow faster! Love love love Seba Med products!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very odd texture, very watery like skim milk, and I would in no way call it a &amp;#34;balm.&amp;#34; It may be, in fact, quite moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t feel particularly emollient or protective. Instead, it just soaks in like water and doesn&#x27;t alleviate that parched skin feeling I get. I have tried shaving the tube vigorously, thinking perhaps it got separated, but no luck. Maybe I got a bad batch, maybe it&#x27;s just strange, but it was definitely not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion, and truly good one for sensitive skin. Made my nails nice too, huge plus for a hand cream. It is a lotion, absorbs fast, but nurishes like a cream. Of course it depends how dry the skin is, but for mine works well, and I wash hands often, or I am guilty of not using gloves  for some chores. Very pleased with this cream, also the fragrance. I bought it at Costco, normally I got it in Europe, it is German pharmacy staple, and a brand trusted for decades, happy to see it in the US, here on amazon. I also like Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy, and [[ASIN:B005CPZFWQ Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream, Fragrance-Free, 2 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] after too much abuse for the skin, when is too dried out. This info is just in case that if you use those creams too, because of similarities of tastes you may like Sebamed too.</li>
            <li> I bought this especially for my nails. I made the dreadful mistake of getting a no chip manicure last year and it damaged my nails so badly that as my nails grew, they peeled to the quick.  This is the ONLY thing that brought my nails back.  I would pay three times more for this product, because I can be proud of my nails again.</li>
            <li> I just bought once time.... but the store sent me one more time and I didn&#x27;t make another purchase. I am afraid about this, how can happen?</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this goes on without feeling greasy and absorbes quickly leaving your hands feeling smooth. It has a very nice scent not to over powering.</li>
            <li> My hands get extremely dry because of the type of job I do, I wash my hands constantly. I&#x27;ve tried other products that&#x27;s supposed to help with the dryness but they didn&#x27;t do as well as the Sebamed hand and nail. I was really happy with hpw quick my hands started to improve even just after the first application.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I work outside and am constantly washing my hands, I have always had a problem with dry hands until I tried Sean&#x27;s Med hand cream. I have never found anything that has worked nearly as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  IT works better than any other hand lotion I have ever tried.  It&#x27;s not cheap but it is worth it for people who have dry skin.Not greasy at al.</li>
            <li> I have a very painful hand condition during the cold weather.  I happen to wash them frequently but I always wear gloves and use creams (especially before bed).  Nothing has ever really helped.  Even with the care that I take, I have painful cracks all around my nails and on my fingertips all winter long.  It makes it very hard to work.  I use band-aids to help keep the blood from getting on paperwork, groceries or most anything that I come in contact with.  It is quite upsetting when people see the condition of my hands, especially when they unexpectedly start to bleed.  The pain is very distracting as well.  Even though the cuts are small, my fingertips must have some pretty substantial nerve endings in them.  As soon as one cut closes up, it seems that three more break open.  Recently I tried Sebamed Hand and Nail cream after discovering the benefits of the hair products (due to a rash).  This hand cream (and even the body cream) have taken the sting out of winter for me.  I have no cuts right now.  If I do get a cut, it heals up quickly.  I am thrilled.  THANK YOU SEBAMED!  You have made my life a whole lot sweeter!</li>
            <li> Not only are the ingredients healthy for us, but the cream is soothing, soaks in quickly and does not leave any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream I have ever used. It sinks right in, my hands are smoother and I can work at my computer without washing my hands first!</li>
            <li> Was excited to try this out as I am already a senamed fan. This hand cream disappoints! It has an extremely strong parfume that I have trouble tolerating. It&#x27;s nothing like the face cream I use. Does not seem to absorb all that well either.</li>
            <li> Smooths out the skin on my hands perfectly when I use it regularly. Only wish they sold it in a bigger size to keep by the sink, but I have 2 (1 in my purse and 1 on m y nightstand).  Really does withstand multiple handwashings and really recommend this product, although a little pricey for handcream.</li>
