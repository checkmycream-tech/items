            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good aroma...... makes good lather...............</li>
            <li>The ease of lather and the texture of the lather is what makes it so good for me.</li>
            <li>Now all he says he needs is some good balm and after shave, just using Witch Hazel for now for aftershave.</li>
            <li>This soap whips up easily into a nice lather and has a very pleasant smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Okay lather but a great scent.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also got the Nomad aftershave balm and it is nicely moisturizing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice, but the soap does not shave well.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl though.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice odour too.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent and the ladies in my life all seem to like it, even at the start of use when I thought it was way to strong.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers easily and feels good on the face.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling as good as the art of shaving product.</li>
            <li>great shave for a man is like a nice hot bubble bath to woman.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this for our son, he always liked his dad&#x27;s stuff, and was excited when he received this, thanks great product!</li>
            <li>Nice soap that gives good lather and leaves the skin feeling fresh and pampered.</li>
            <li>My wife loves when I use this one, it is her favorite too, It also leaves my skin very smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Moved the soap into a mug, works better that way for me.</li>
            <li>You can place the wood cap on top after using with no effect of warping or rotting the hardwood bowl.</li>
            <li>Crabtree and Evelyn sell many scented refill soaps for this dish.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a barber quality shave with just TWO passes....</li>
            <li>Great, fast, creamy lather in just a jiffy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible shaving soap, but for the price you can do MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Both are great scents and the soap lathers very well.</li>
            <li>my go to, lathers really well and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>However, the foam is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Was able to get a good shave even though it was his first time with shaving soap and a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I tend to prefer fresh and clean soapy scents like DR Harris&#x27; Arlington, but this is very nice as well...</li>
            <li>First shave soap that I have truly loved from the start.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woody, with notes of lime and warm spices, and decidedly masculine yet still very sophisticated and timeless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the lather easy to build as well.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged, shipped, and arrived fine.</li>
            <li>not much to say aside from great scent , lathers easily and provides tons of protective lather !</li>
            <li>A HUGE bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need for a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this soap.  </li>
            <li>The wooden bowl is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this is a pleasure, and the wooden bowl is actually very nice</li>
            <li>Lathers really well, Smells good and not irritating (I get irritated really easy, specially by scented soaps).</li>
            <li>I had the slightest bit of irritation on my top lip, but that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s my most sensitive and troublesome area.  </li>
            <li>Was easy for him to work up a decent lather, even though he needs a better cup to work it up.</li>
            <li>Not an intoxicating aroma, but pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>I mean INCREDIBLE!  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, lathers good even with hard water.</li>
            <li>My second favorite soap is Colonel Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum and the Nomad produces a notably thicker and slicker lather with</li>
            <li>also own and use the Proraso Eucalyptus and Menthol shaving soap, but lately I find more and more that this is the one I reach for when it is time for a shave.</li>
            <li>He loves the ritual of shaving with this and a big brush, and we both love the scent!</li>
            <li>(wetshaving makes the activity a bit more interesting, precise, and economical, but it&#x27;s still a chore at heart for me, so I don&#x27;t like to waste time in self-absorbed \\&quot;luxuriating\\&quot; and \\&quot;pampering\\&quot; myself</li>
            <li>That alone to me is worth the price of admission!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and quick to lather, gives the slickest lather I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s the second thickest lathering soap I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>While the foam is much better than other scents sold by Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, there are better soaps to be had.</li>
            <li>It does everything a soap should do and does it extremely well, plus it smells good.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a puck of this 9 months ago from a C&amp;E store at the Mall of America and after the first use, it was by a substantial margin the best soap I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve got about 25 little plastic cups with a big variety of shaving soap samplers cluttering up my shower rack plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first C &amp; E product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m eagerly looking forward to trying others (I&#x27;ve already bought the West Indian Lime and Sandalwood soaps and am flirting with the idea of getting the Nomad AS balm).  </li>
            <li>Adding to my growing collection of creams and soaps, I went for this for my first C&amp;E scent.</li>
            <li>This is better soap than I figured it would be; I will purchase this brand again to try different flavors.</li>
            <li>Nomad was famous in the traditional shaving community for a reason !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a masculine smell and as someone else mentioned, it is a bit strong at first, but it really mellows out once it&#x27;s whipped into a lather and on one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>It is distinct and strong when you first open it</li>
            <li>and in no time I was able to whip up a creamy, lofty and rich lather using my $12 tweezerman badger brush that never broke down.  </li>
            <li>But after couple of uses and storing the bowl without the lid for two days the soap aired out and the true scent revealed itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to classic straight shaving but with this soap I can easily get lather that is rich enough.</li>
            <li>I shave almost daily and see that this soap will last me many months, perhaps a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>scent was very strong and a little offputting when I first opened the container.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really like the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very distinctive...</li>
            <li>absolutely unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again, very manly.  </li>
            <li>Buy this and as much as you can afford as it is discontinued by</li>
            <li>which is important to me as I don&#x27;t like smelling like everyone else, or just the hot new scent that no one will remember next season.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new at the whole shaving brush thing</li>
            <li>(I did prep my face properly with a hot shower and pre shave cream, and used a fresh blade).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using TOBS and Geo Trumper cream products and this soap has been as good, if not superior, in performance and quality</li>
            <li>Mainly a cream guy</li>
            <li>After 9 months of use 2-5x/week (more often in recent months as I&#x27;ve grown bored with the hobby aspect of trying out new products and just want the best shave I can get every morning), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m less than halfway through the puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides looking neat in your shaving cabinet,this soap works just fine as is with a wet brush twirled into it and a pile of lather is immediately worked up for use.</li>
            <li>It sure does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of odd that C&amp;E did not make the scents identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the not-exactly-matching scent of the AS balm, the only negative with this product is that the soap puck was tightly wrapped on top with a paper liner that appeared to be the top of the soap at first, so I actually and rather obtusely didn&#x27;t notice that it was there and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got hard water that doesn&#x27;t work well with some of the artisanal  soaps (particularly tallow-based ones) that are popular such Mike&#x27;s or Queen Charlotte Soaps, but the C&amp;E works fantastic in my water and in other waters.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another cream more regularly (probably due to convenience sake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a set of go-to products for my shaving rotation as I&#x27;m getting back into wet shaving, and this C&amp;E Nomad shaving soap is at the top of a very short list.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have thick resilient skin this soap is okay for you though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is a spicy, woodsy smell with a slight citrusy scent, somewhat reminiscent of clean Arabian spices, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Nomad as a shaving creme for a long time and this shave soap in my opinion delivers the same quality product and as you can imagine much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Really sad because it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>And let me also mention I have an extremely tough beard; this soap helped me go right through it like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Once empty, the bowls make good little storage boxes for small items......</li>
            <li>Though Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s target customer may be a little bit older than my boyfriend and I (early 20s), when we came across this scent we were both blown away.</li>
            <li>Very little is needed to produce a rich lather so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I place a few tablespoons of hot water in it to soften it up a bit prior to use, then pour the water out prior to applying the brush to the soap.</li>

            <li> After 9 months of use 2-5x/week (more often in recent months as I&#x27;ve grown bored with the hobby aspect of trying out new products and just want the best shave I can get every morning), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m less than halfway through the puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides looking neat in your shaving cabinet,this soap works just fine as is with a wet brush twirled into it and a pile of lather is immediately worked up for use.</li>
            <li> It sure does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of odd that C&amp;E did not make the scents identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the not-exactly-matching scent of the AS balm, the only negative with this product is that the soap puck was tightly wrapped on top with a paper liner that appeared to be the top of the soap at first, so I actually and rather obtusely didn&#x27;t notice that it was there and</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a set of go-to products for my shaving rotation as I&#x27;m getting back into wet shaving, and this C&amp;E Nomad shaving soap is at the top of a very short list.  </li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have thick resilient skin this soap is okay for you though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is a spicy, woodsy smell with a slight citrusy scent, somewhat reminiscent of clean Arabian spices, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nomad as a shaving creme for a long time and this shave soap in my opinion delivers the same quality product and as you can imagine much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Really sad because it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> And let me also mention I have an extremely tough beard; this soap helped me go right through it like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> Once empty, the bowls make good little storage boxes for small items......</li>
            <li> Though Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s target customer may be a little bit older than my boyfriend and I (early 20s), when we came across this scent we were both blown away.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed to produce a rich lather so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I place a few tablespoons of hot water in it to soften it up a bit prior to use, then pour the water out prior to applying the brush to the soap.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s even a very solid value, notwithstanding that it&#x27;s priced in the mid-to-luxury range, because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> and I expect it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Finished up with a cold water rinse and Nivea sensitive skin balm and my face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  </li>
            <li> It is not as slick as many other less expensive soaps and dissolves fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a terrific scent too, just not exactly the same scent as the Nomad shave soap.  </li>
            <li> However this soap sometimes burned my face a little, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will be using NOMAD for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> Not really a problem as I follow it up with the shave balm of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if price was lower, might raise rating if it lasts as long as some claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Size is quit big than expected.</li>
            <li> somewhere between that and Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Trafalgar (not nearly as woodsy).</li>
            <li> the first time I tried it, I wetted down the paper liner and tried to generate some lather but ended up rubbing the paper into small pieces.  </li>
            <li> lather lasts a long time on the face (no dissipating bubbles) and because it&#x27;s also quite a hard soap, the puck is lasting a very long time, too.</li>
            <li> Only gripe I have with it is the very little amount of scent they put in it.  </li>
            <li> Thought I may have done something wrong the first time</li>
            <li> After shaving and washing my face the product was applied and by the end of the day, my entire beard area was broken out into a topical rash.</li>
            <li> less work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the replacement pucks are half the price of the puck and bowl together.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the adage</li>
            <li> it does however seem to lose some of its scent after you have had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> (Arko is thicker and faster to lather but less slick and smells like a urinal cake).  </li>
            <li> If you use enough water to make it a little slick, it goes thin.  </li>
            <li> He usually uses the art of shaving-cream--which he will start to use again.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient is causing the irritation</li>

            <li> and I have hard water.</li>
            <li> Oh, btw...did I mention that we have extremely hard water?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Very nice smell, and good lather.  Moved the soap into a mug, works better that way for me.</li>
            <li> I picked up a puck of this 9 months ago from a C&amp;E store at the Mall of America and after the first use, it was by a substantial margin the best soap I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve got about 25 little plastic cups with a big variety of shaving soap samplers cluttering up my shower rack plus a dozen full-sized pucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got hard water that doesn&#x27;t work well with some of the artisanal  soaps (particularly tallow-based ones) that are popular such Mike&#x27;s or Queen Charlotte Soaps, but the C&amp;E works fantastic in my water and in other waters.  It&#x27;s very easy and quick to lather, gives the slickest lather I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s the second thickest lathering soap I&#x27;ve tried (Arko is thicker and faster to lather but less slick and smells like a urinal cake).  I&#x27;d say it takes me all of about 20 seconds of swishing my brush around in the tub before it is sufficiently loaded to face lather (wetshaving makes the activity a bit more interesting, precise, and economical, but it&#x27;s still a chore at heart for me, so I don&#x27;t like to waste time in self-absorbed \\&quot;luxuriating\\&quot; and \\&quot;pampering\\&quot; myself and I have no use for soaps or methods that take 5+ minutes to \\&quot;build and coax\\&quot; a lather, so therefore, I face lather).  My second favorite soap is Colonel Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum and the Nomad produces a notably thicker and slicker lather with less work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather lasts a long time on the face (no dissipating bubbles) and because it&#x27;s also quite a hard soap, the puck is lasting a very long time, too. After 9 months of use 2-5x/week (more often in recent months as I&#x27;ve grown bored with the hobby aspect of trying out new products and just want the best shave I can get every morning), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m less than halfway through the puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a spicy, woodsy smell with a slight citrusy scent, somewhat reminiscent of clean Arabian spices, I suppose.  It&#x27;s quite a masculine smell and as someone else mentioned, it is a bit strong at first, but it really mellows out once it&#x27;s whipped into a lather and on one&#x27;s face.  My wife really likes the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also got the Nomad aftershave balm and it is nicely moisturizing and soothing.  It has a terrific scent too, just not exactly the same scent as the Nomad shave soap.  It&#x27;s kind of odd that C&amp;E did not make the scents identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the not-exactly-matching scent of the AS balm, the only negative with this product is that the soap puck was tightly wrapped on top with a paper liner that appeared to be the top of the soap at first, so I actually and rather obtusely didn&#x27;t notice that it was there and the first time I tried it, I wetted down the paper liner and tried to generate some lather but ended up rubbing the paper into small pieces.  Dohhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific soap.  It does everything a soap should do and does it extremely well, plus it smells good.  And it&#x27;s even a very solid value, notwithstanding that it&#x27;s priced in the mid-to-luxury range, because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Nice soap that gives good lather and leaves the skin feeling fresh and pampered. The bowl is beautiful and well made. I shave almost daily and see that this soap will last me many months, perhaps a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was very strong and a little offputting when I first opened the container. But after couple of uses and storing the bowl without the lid for two days the soap aired out and the true scent revealed itself. Pleasant scent and the ladies in my life all seem to like it, even at the start of use when I thought it was way to strong.</li>
            <li> Besides looking neat in your shaving cabinet,this soap works just fine as is with a wet brush twirled into it and a pile of lather is immediately worked up for use. There is no harm rinsing the wood bowl after use and using a towel to wipe off excess water. You can place the wood cap on top after using with no effect of warping or rotting the hardwood bowl. Crabtree and Evelyn sell many scented refill soaps for this dish.</li>
            <li> Mainly a cream guy and I find this soap somewhat drying.  Definitely need an ASB with this one.  Okay lather but a great scent.  Teak wood bowl is very nice.  If you like shave soaps give it a try</li>
            <li> I really, really like the smell of this soap. Every time after I shave I can smell this soap &amp; the Nomad Calming After Shave Balm for hours and it&#x27;s refreshing! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because another reviewer said it worked well with hard water. They were correct, it&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve used and I have hard water. Great lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new at the whole shaving brush thing but I&#x27;m getting closer shaves and my girlfriend LOVES the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the adage &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;.  I have been looking for a set of go-to products for my shaving rotation as I&#x27;m getting back into wet shaving, and this C&amp;E Nomad shaving soap is at the top of a very short list.  The smell is incredible.  No...I mean INCREDIBLE!  It&#x27;s woody, with notes of lime and warm spices, and decidedly masculine yet still very sophisticated and timeless.  And it&#x27;s very distinctive...which is important to me as I don&#x27;t like smelling like everyone else, or just the hot new scent that no one will remember next season.  It presents nicely in a beautiful hardwood bowl (teak, maybe?) and in no time I was able to whip up a creamy, lofty and rich lather using my $12 tweezerman badger brush that never broke down.  Oh, btw...did I mention that we have extremely hard water?  That alone to me is worth the price of admission!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have sensitive skin and I was worried that, being a soap, it wouldn&#x27;t provide the protection and moisture I need for a close and comfortable shave.  Boy, was I wrong!  I was able to get a barber quality shave with just TWO passes....absolutely unheard of for me.  (I did prep my face properly with a hot shower and pre shave cream, and used a fresh blade).  And let me also mention I have an extremely tough beard; this soap helped me go right through it like a hot knife through butter.  Finished up with a cold water rinse and Nivea sensitive skin balm and my face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  I had the slightest bit of irritation on my top lip, but that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s my most sensitive and troublesome area.  I&#x27;ve also kept a mustache for years and recently started shaving it regularly, so it&#x27;s still breaking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first C &amp; E product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m eagerly looking forward to trying others (I&#x27;ve already bought the West Indian Lime and Sandalwood soaps and am flirting with the idea of getting the Nomad AS balm).  I&#x27;ve been using TOBS and Geo Trumper cream products and this soap has been as good, if not superior, in performance and quality and I expect it will last a long time.  And the replacement pucks are half the price of the puck and bowl together.  So like I said before you get what you pay for, and I think if you take all the factors into consideration that this is a bargain.  A HUGE bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shave for a man is like a nice hot bubble bath to woman.  So go ahead and treat yourself...you&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Lathers really well, Smells good and not irritating (I get irritated really easy, specially by scented soaps). Thta being said i stll have to use aftershave and lotion but if your using this you probably alreayd know that.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Good aroma...... makes good lather...............I have their Eau de Toilette as well. Once empty, the bowls make good little storage boxes for small items......</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this soap.  I don&#x27;t use it for every shave however.  I&#x27;ve been using another cream more regularly (probably due to convenience sake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this product.  I place a few tablespoons of hot water in it to soften it up a bit prior to use, then pour the water out prior to applying the brush to the soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nomad as a shaving creme for a long time and this shave soap in my opinion delivers the same quality product and as you can imagine much cheaper.  There is also some nostalgia to using a shave soap that seems to take you back.  I will be using NOMAD for a long long time.  My wife is the one that got me started on it.</li>
            <li> Great, fast, creamy lather in just a jiffy.  First shave soap that I have truly loved from the start.  Only gripe I have with it is the very little amount of scent they put in it.  It sure does not last long at all.  Not really a problem as I follow it up with the shave balm of the same brand.  The ease of lather and the texture of the lather is what makes it so good for me.</li>
            <li> Not an intoxicating aroma, but pleasant enough.  The soap lathers easily and feels good on the face.  Very little is needed to produce a rich lather so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff man!!  Great Scent too!  My wife likes both the container and the smell!!  Good for me!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lathers good even with hard water. Would be 5 stars if price was lower, might raise rating if it lasts as long as some claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time my husband has tried shaving soap. Was easy for him to work up a decent lather, even though he needs a better cup to work it up. He had no irritation from it like he has some of the canned foams he has tried over the years. Was able to get a good shave even though it was his first time with shaving soap and a safety razor. Now all he says he needs is some good balm and after shave, just using Witch Hazel for now for aftershave.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this shave soap it does however seem to lose some of its scent after you have had it a few weeks and that is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.  I will probably buy this again, very manly.  The wooden bowl is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> Got for my husband.  He usually uses the art of shaving-cream--which he will start to use again.  Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling as good as the art of shaving product.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice, but the soap does not shave well. If you use enough water to make it a little slick, it goes thin.  It&#x27;s not a terrible shaving soap, but for the price you can do MUCH better. Nice bowl though.</li>
            <li> Size is quit big than expected. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to classic straight shaving but with this soap I can easily get lather that is rich enough. Nice odour too.</li>
            <li> Adding to my growing collection of creams and soaps, I went for this for my first C&amp;E scent. I tend to prefer fresh and clean soapy scents like DR Harris&#x27; Arlington, but this is very nice as well... somewhere between that and Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Trafalgar (not nearly as woodsy). I&#x27;ve found the lather easy to build as well.</li>
            <li> This is better soap than I figured it would be; I will purchase this brand again to try different flavors.</li>
            <li> Though Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s target customer may be a little bit older than my boyfriend and I (early 20s), when we came across this scent we were both blown away. It&#x27;s manly and musky without being too perfumey and overpowering. I ordered it online for his birthday after smelling it with him in a store. He loves the ritual of shaving with this and a big brush, and we both love the scent!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for our son, he always liked his dad&#x27;s stuff, and was excited when he received this, thanks great product!</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on several reviews and recommendations. The product was packaged, shipped, and arrived fine. Price was comparable with all of the vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have had with the product is that it irritates my skin. Not sure what ingredient is causing the irritation but, I have only used twice. After shaving and washing my face the product was applied and by the end of the day, my entire beard area was broken out into a topical rash. Thought I may have done something wrong the first time so, I used it for a second time and got the same results.  Really sad because it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried the nomad scent and the sandalwood scent. Both are great scents and the soap lathers very well. However this soap sometimes burned my face a little, I have sensitive skin. I prefer Proraso or for puck soap col. Conk or van der Hagen soap. If you have thick resilient skin this soap is okay for you though.</li>
            <li> not much to say aside from great scent , lathers easily and provides tons of protective lather ! Buy this and as much as you can afford as it is discontinued by C&amp;E. The replacement Moroccan Myrrh was reformulated and has horrible performance to say the least. Nomad was famous in the traditional shaving community for a reason ! It worked !</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shave soaps I have used, this is def my go to, lathers really well and has a great smell. My wife loves when I use this one, it is her favorite too, It also leaves my skin very smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The scent is great.  It is distinct and strong when you first open it but it is not overpowering when you create your foam.  However, the foam is just okay.  It is not as slick as many other less expensive soaps and dissolves fairly quickly.  While the foam is much better than other scents sold by Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, there are better soaps to be had.</li>
            <li> This soap whips up easily into a nice lather and has a very pleasant smell that is not overpowering. Shaving with this is a pleasure, and the wooden bowl is actually very nice which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own and use the Proraso Eucalyptus and Menthol shaving soap, but lately I find more and more that this is the one I reach for when it is time for a shave.</li>
