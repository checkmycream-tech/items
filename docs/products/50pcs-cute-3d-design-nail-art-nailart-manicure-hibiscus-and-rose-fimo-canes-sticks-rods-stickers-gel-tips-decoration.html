            <li>It may be for someone else who likes this kind of time consuming work,but it doesn&#x27;t even look to me like it would eb attractive on your nails.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been doing my own gelicures at home</li>
            <li>but these are kind of a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>Excellent price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Some cut nicely, others did not.  </li>
            <li>These are very cute and my school age girls love them.  </li>
            <li>Any girl who like to do her own nails would love these items.</li>
            <li>I just loved these so cute and easy to use</li>

            <li>and she love&#x27;s the roses .</li>
            <li>so it ok I guess</li>
            <li>So cute, so girly. :)</li>
            <li>and I can do them by myself:)</li>
            <li>The 50 pcs are all lovely and cute.</li>
            <li>These were ok, but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>I bought these fimo canes on a whim, to expand my nail art a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love the quick delivery also.</li>
            <li>I figured I would buy some nail art to make them more fun</li>
            <li>This item is ok if you are VERY much into nails.</li>
            <li>You are able to get a whole lot of designs for your money.</li>
            <li>Tiny, cute designs and easy to slice with a razor blade</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>They are worth the money though for the amount and variety you get.  </li>
            <li>It makes for a fun activity with girls.</li>
            <li>Wish there had been some red roses in these, but over cute.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely cute, if not basic designs, and constructed well.</li>
            <li>It looks like it is too much work...</li>
            <li>and she really has not even tried to use them because it is too time consuming.</li>
            <li>Im very girly.</li>
            <li>They dont however stay on very well, we used nail glue</li>
            <li>so they fit flatly against my nail.</li>
            <li>they dont stay on very well and were smaller than i was expecting.</li>
            <li>We bought it for our 12 year old who is into doing nails now</li>
            <li>Thanks for short time shipping.</li>
            <li>the designs are cute but there are about 5 of the exact same things so they get kind of boring.</li>
            <li>I had to get used to cutting them but really loved the colors</li>
            <li>I made sure that I bought the razor blades so that I could cut them thinly</li>
            <li>(he likes a challenge) and of course he was able to do it thin enough  </li>

            <li> I really was not pleased with this item at all.</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than we expected and you have to cut the pieces off</li>
            <li> i love to slice them up real thin</li>
            <li> but in the end the clay was so old and hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble cutting these straight, without any sort of &amp;#34;warble&amp;#34; to them, and I have a very steady hand.</li>
            <li> but I guess I didn&#x27;t do it thin enough because they fell off the next day.</li>
            <li> I have used them a few times already on my toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I prefer the ease of precuts.</li>
            <li> they are just a waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> not sure how to use them..</li>
            <li> They are also hard to cut.</li>
            <li> and I cut them as thin as I could.  </li>
            <li> the patters repeat them self over and over I am not impressed, but ppl seem to like them</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> they are these weird bendable sticks...</li>
            <li> my stupidity, i didnt know what they were when i ordered them.</li>
            <li> I received this item and my mom took care of the cutting with razor the rods.</li>

            <li> You get a lot of these but the designs are repeated</li>
            <li> Tiny, cute designs and easy to slice with a razor blade but in the end the clay was so old and hard, I couldn&#x27;t use it since it would not bend at all.</li>
            <li> I just loved these so cute and easy to use I had to get used to cutting them but really loved the colors</li>
            <li> my stupidity, i didnt know what they were when i ordered them.</li>
            <li> These were not what i was expecting they are for the pro&#x27;s. they dont stay on very well and were smaller than i was expecting. the designs are cute but there are about 5 of the exact same things so they get kind of boring. They are also hard to cut. they are just a waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she love&#x27;s the roses .</li>
            <li> the patters repeat them self over and over I am not impressed, but ppl seem to like them so it ok I guess</li>
            <li> Great buy. Any girl who like to do her own nails would love these items. So cute, so girly. :)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been doing my own gelicures at home I figured I would buy some nail art to make them more fun but these are kind of a pain in the butt. I made sure that I bought the razor blades so that I could cut them thinly but I guess I didn&#x27;t do it thin enough because they fell off the next day. So I had my husband do it (he likes a challenge) and of course he was able to do it thin enough  so they didn&#x27;t fall off but now he&#x27;s deployed so I decided to stick with the stickers they&#x27;re easier and I can do them by myself:)</li>
            <li> I received this item and my mom took care of the cutting with razor the rods. The 50 pcs are all lovely and cute. I have used them a few times already on my toes. I love the quick delivery also. Amazaon is great with my orders. Thank you Amazon...</li>
            <li> This item is ok if you are VERY much into nails. They are much smaller than we expected and you have to cut the pieces off and then I am assuming you have to glue them to the nail. It looks like it is too much work...We bought it for our 12 year old who is into doing nails now and she really has not even tried to use them because it is too time consuming. I really was not pleased with this item at all. Sorry.It may be for someone else who likes this kind of time consuming work,but it doesn&#x27;t even look to me like it would eb attractive on your nails.</li>
            <li> Im very girly. so these were perfect for me. i love to slice them up real thin so they fit flatly against my nail. they are great all flowers of the colors you see</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> These were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Some cut nicely, others did not.  Wish there had been some red roses in these, but over cute.  Thanks for short time shipping.</li>
            <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
            <li> I bought these fimo canes on a whim, to expand my nail art a bit more. They&#x27;re definitely cute, if not basic designs, and constructed well. My only observation is I definitely prefer pre-sliced fimo art. I&#x27;ve had trouble cutting these straight, without any sort of &amp;#34;warble&amp;#34; to them, and I have a very steady hand. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I prefer the ease of precuts. I will definitely continue to use these til they&#x27;re gone, but next time I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and my school age girls love them.  They dont however stay on very well, we used nail glue and I cut them as thin as I could.  They are worth the money though for the amount and variety you get.  It makes for a fun activity with girls.</li>
            <li> they are these weird bendable sticks... not sure how to use them.. I thought they were stick on stickers, but they aren&#x27;t... IDK</li>
            <li> I love the fimo designs they are very easy to cut and apply. You are able to get a whole lot of designs for your money.</li>
