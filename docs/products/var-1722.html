            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I needed an eyebrow stencil until I added this to an order just to increase the price to get my add on items delivered lol.</li>

            <li>stencils worked great for me, but I can understand how some individuals can have issues with it.</li>
            <li>im so happy</li>
            <li>Great instructions &amp; tips</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I just love them they are so awesome and do a great job</li>
            <li>This stencil set is amazing!</li>
            <li>The results were just amazing!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look amazing from it!</li>
            <li>Amazing price!</li>
            <li>Nice surprise!</li>
            <li>Then I fill in the top of the line freehand to make nice eyebrows on both sides, just having the line to start saves me hours of drawing, erasing, redrawing, ect because NO ONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL FACE!!!</li>
            <li>I used these stencils about two times because I learned how to shape my eyebrows on my own!</li>
            <li>Although not all of the stencils are meant for me, the one that I found most helpful was a great guideline the shape of my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>After many deliberations in choosing an Eyebrow Stencil Kit, this one seem like the best</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work out the best but ok.</li>
            <li>very nice good quality</li>
            <li>Easy eyebrows, even and perfectly shaped every time.</li>
            <li>The best part is their plastic texture which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>so this wasn&#x27;t a suprise that it works so good for me.</li>
            <li>If you have a longer and wider brow line, this would be good for you.</li>
            <li>Received product as described in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;product is good, makes it easier to shape my brow.</li>
            <li>It may not even look good on you.  </li>
            <li>Even men need to have good eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Good for beginners...</li>
            <li>It will make those eyebrows look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It was a good product.</li>

            <li>I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I could do my eye brows and it looks good every time I leave the house.</li>
            <li>Incredible magic</li>
            <li>my eye brown look so good</li>
            <li>Good, but not for me....</li>
            <li>Didnt look good.</li>
            <li>These are a really good idea.</li>
            <li>None of the sizes or arches looked good on me.  </li>
            <li>BUT, much to my pleasant surprise, these work fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Nice price with nice product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these will give you beautiful results</li>

            <li>I liked it because it fit me perfectly.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked E.L.F. products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I preferred and found I liked just drawing my own.</li>
            <li>Some ladies liked squared eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I like that the stencil will let u get a nice shaped eyebrow</li>
            <li>I have nice, fuller brows</li>
            <li>though to be honest i know already to do my own eyebrows</li>
            <li>This is a nice product and was a nice price.</li>
            <li>With this, you must buy some kind of powder to accompany it.  </li>
            <li>for look nice  go out dinner or party or with my bf ..</li>
            <li>got this item in a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>An adhesive of some kind would have been nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They seemed like they would be awesome, but they are really flemsy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit.  </li>
            <li>Nice shapes, close to my own.  </li>
            <li>These stencils are nice-</li>
            <li>They give a nice variety of shapes.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I appreciate what E.L.F was trying to do with this</li>
            <li>I tried them out and wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Nice shapes</li>
            <li>The brush is nice for applying, you have the spiral brush for combing and the wax for setting.  </li>
            <li>The eyebrow stencils aren&#x27;t cheaply made, they&#x27;re actually very nice.  </li>
            <li>and I am actually REALLY EXCITED!!</li>
            <li>Anastasia high arch is still the best for me.</li>
            <li>Great, if you&#x27;re like me that doesn&#x27;t know how to make a perfect brow, these sheets just make it easy, and there&#x27;s different brows shapes, use the one that fit you most!!</li>
            <li>well this kit is good and easy to use,u can bring anywhere</li>
            <li>They worked great with all kinds of brow powders - a thicker brush gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it came quickly &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li>It’s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and durable....</li>
            <li>This might be good for people with huge bushy eyebrows, but mine are a lot thinner than the stencils.</li>
            <li>The thinnest one matched my natural arch best</li>
            <li>The shape is exactly as it should be and beautiful.</li>
            <li>none of the stencils were a good fit..</li>
            <li>okay, I think that I would think twice again for paying almost $6 for 4 pieces of plastic eyebrow shapes, that I could honestly just cut off from the internet....</li>
            <li>it will get more effective.</li>
            <li>I find that I like the colored stick on kind better.</li>
            <li>and i recommend anyone whos new to eyebrow shaping or even someone who has for awhile that still get there eyesbrows pretty cricked to try lol its wonderful</li>
            <li>I was looking for set that would be easy to use and that would save me some $ from getting my eyebrows done at the salon!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the plastic material is bendable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a couple wider and (especially) more natural arches.</li>
            <li>Great reusble, easy to clean product.</li>
            <li>Perfect to get general shape</li>
            <li>but everything else was fine!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and did not like the sketch styles.</li>
            <li>Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend.</li>
            <li>Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is a nice quality product that is easy to use.</li>
            <li>With these, it doesn&#x27;t get it perfect right away, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close</li>
            <li>I love the eyebrow stencils, so easy to use since i&#x27;m no make-up artist to fill them in on my own.</li>
            <li>I love it already and just got it yesterday</li>
            <li>They are ok.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been better if it came with instructions or tips.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, as it does involve patience and focus, I love it though :)</li>
            <li>I can achieve my look better freehand than I can with these.</li>
            <li>But somehow may face looks better with shaped eyebrows than unshaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the time I am tempted to just shave them off and get them tattooed on</li>
            <li>If you are able to pull off an anime face or celebrity look because you have no eyebrows and paint them on then</li>
            <li>if u are beginners and want to have your own technique to learn u should try to use this.the price is cheap and every women out there for sure can afford it.(wink)</li>
            <li>As I age, I notice that my eyebrows are getting more sparse and look lighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been using these stencils for weeks now and just love them!&lt;br /&gt;All of</li>
            <li>Gonna try that and see what happens, then I&#x27;ll be able to give a better review of how they work.</li>
            <li>I was trying to get a better arch.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>Love all elf stuff :)</li>
            <li>Wish stencils were made of more durable and firmer plastic.</li>
            <li>then make sure the two connect.</li>
            <li>Loved the variety and they&#x27;re doing me really good so far. :)</li>
            <li>It is durable and can be used many times.</li>
            <li>These have been helpful in getting a more identical shape</li>
            <li>better do it freehand.</li>
            <li>I would recommend creating your own stencils that will fit your face and shape.</li>
            <li>WOUD COST ME MORE</li>
            <li>I can tell that 2 or 3 more times using this</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>Might be better for someone else.</li>
            <li>I am able to do it.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Guess i should be glad refund was given.</li>
            <li>I take my thumb and index finger to hold the top of the stencil along my brow, then trace my brow with a brown eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>fast lol</li>
            <li>See Francios Nars book on eyebrows for a better how-to.</li>
            <li>These would be OK, if I wanted clown brows.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can play with it some more, but I just don&#x27;t think this item is for me.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They look SO much better than they used to.</li>
            <li>I love these stencils because without them filling my eyebrows would be a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>I love the concept.</li>
            <li>so they should fit all faces no matter the shape or size!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get both brows identical with just my pencils</li>
            <li>fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the ELF  products...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the shape, either.</li>
            <li>Found my personal perfect eyebrow shape in this kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to freehand anymore :)  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just time consuming :)</li>
            <li>I guess for women who have this shape, the stencils will work ok.</li>
            <li>but you will eventually find one that works for you and you will love it :)</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>AND SOME OF&lt;br /&gt;THE \\&quot;KITS\\&quot; COULD COST UP TO $50.00 OR MORE DOLLARS BECAUSE</li>
            <li>Love these stencils..</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted to give a more appealing shape to me eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They are ok, not what I thought they would be</li>
            <li>For sure.</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Now my eye brows stylish:)</li>
            <li>I picked out my favorite</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wipe it off before and after each use.  </li>
            <li>i love this eyebrow stencil kit.</li>
            <li>are the perfect way to shape your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Love It.......</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>so I could see what I was doing better.</li>
            <li>I love that this kit has a variety of arches to choose from.  </li>
            <li>The different shapes are AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Got these for my mom, she loves them :)</li>
            <li>and now they&#x27;re sitting in the unused make-up graveyard which is the trash. :-)</li>
            <li>Ok, wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t creative with using these stencils, you could end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>So, I looked on Amazon instead and got a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, They are some eyebrow tutorials on Youtube that talks about how to properly fill in eyebrows, be sure to check them out and see which method works best for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Luck. :)</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>thank you :)</li>
            <li>Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved these stencils at first.</li>
            <li>They are pretty shapes for eyebrows, really good price and durable.</li>
            <li>This was one of the best purchase I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>If you like your eyebrows think and long then these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Straightforward with a variety of brow shapes to use!</li>
            <li>I love it, my eyebrows are even and easy to put on..</li>
            <li>I like the shapes and they are very easy to clean</li>
            <li>i am so excited to test this out for an big party tonight :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this because it turns out not as huge as some reviewer said.</li>
            <li>so I just use the top line to shape the brow and fill in the rest free hand.</li>
            <li>If I could find a better fit I would trade these in.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have to give this product 5 stars because it does work, quite well infact, and was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great for shaping natural eyebrows</li>
            <li>I use it to apply a light guide to make sure I get my brows an even shape.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t pluck for a while and grew as much of my eyebrows back as I could, then tried each of the 4 stencils out by filling in with an eyebrow pencil to see which I liked best.</li>
            <li>I can do it better free hand.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t likethe outlines they didn&#x27;t really look good.</li>
            <li>I really love how easy to use and accurate this product is.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep in place.</li>
            <li>the stencils work well for me, and they are so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super easy, and affective.</li>
            <li>This product is not as easy to use as I thought but after some time I did get the desired result.</li>
            <li>I like the different shapes this kit contains, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li>The stencils are well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The paper stencils are flimsy and rip easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it is flexible and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll rip easily.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>I also felt that the soft plastic, although good to conform to your face shape, may easily become warped over time, as there is nothing connecting the arch like most eyebrow stencils.</li>
            <li>The stencils are flimsy plastic and do not stay on the brow easily when I try to fill in the stencil area.</li>
            <li>It is a great help to have the stencils to help you make sure that both brows are the same length and thickness.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are for the most part full but have like no arch</li>
            <li>I think after I use them for a few more months, I&#x27;ll learn to do it on my own, but until then, these stencils are great.</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li>I freehand fine and get lots of compliments that way</li>
            <li>I was not super impressed with these stencils.</li>
            <li>For a dollar it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>If you have lots of time to do your makeup, then they will probably work fine for you.</li>
            <li>bought these for only one of the stencils that looked pretty close to my ideal brow shape, and the one I felt like I could most easily pull</li>
            <li>but quick shipping and package came with no problem!</li>
            <li>Love that you get 4 different stencils and the directions were good and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>They were all so huge that I</li>
            <li>The stencils are HUGE.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and you have to cut the edges to fit</li>
            <li>They definitely don&#x27;t work as great as I thought.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t fit your face.</li>
            <li>but these give my brows a fabulous shape.</li>
            <li>, like none of them felt like they fit my face.</li>
            <li>Accept your real brow, tidy up stray hairs, and do them with a shadow and a setting wax or gel.  </li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t fit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and i have no regrets.prefect fit ..</li>
            <li>You can also use a lighter brown or color of choice pencil to draw the eyebrow, remove the stencil, and fill in with light upward and outward strokes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my face at all</li>
            <li>I clean easy.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say I really didn&#x27;t expect a lot in ordering these as they aren&#x27;t even 5 bucks?</li>
            <li>This was a great idea but it limits the style and shape for your individual brows.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap though, I threw it away.</li>
            <li>but I can make adjustments free hand.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s become faster than free handing with pencils or powders alone.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look fantastic</li>
            <li>but there is understandably no way to make a fit for everyone</li>
            <li>For me, nothing fit, I even tried trimming, they will end up in the trash.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to use my Tarte architect brow pencil free</li>
            <li>/&gt;i end up just free handing it which take a bit longer</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they fit my shape of eyebrows and we a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>lol I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li>and I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It would also be much easier to use if there were some kind of adhesive and/or a guide to placement.</li>
            <li>The stencil worked great for me to practice on what the final view should look like.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and was packaged nicely, thank you</li>
            <li>immeadiately after the brows are filled in.</li>
            <li>It is very economical as far as being able to do your own brows rather than going to a salon.</li>
            <li>I liked that the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>Other than that they are perfect and would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking eyebrows</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift and thought it would be cool to have and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you want to use this as means for a guide as in using the bottom or top, just a little at first, that would be best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of these stencils are nice and the box it comes with is very easy to open.</li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and all you do and trace the shape onto your eyebrow and fill in the rest.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and nice, I just don&#x27;t know how to apply it fully, I&#x27;m new though.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to shape and/or fill in your own brow to get a natural looking result.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I got these to try to help shape my eyebrows into a thicker shape and they were way thinner than what I originally have.</li>
            <li>Your eyebrows are unique for your face.  </li>
            <li>they are not user friendly at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>My original order of this product was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having this in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li>But besides that the product is good, easily bent to lay flat on the face, but durable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure i would be able to position these stencils so that they were natural looking .</li>
            <li>Whenever i try to do my eyebrows free handed, they end up looking horrendous and super drawn on.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, kind of big for my face.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the kit itself looks fantastic and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I get one a bit off kilter, but have always been able to fix ithem easily, by manipulating the way I hold it, or using a q-tip to clean up around the edges a bit.&lt;br /&gt;These stencils give a very nice, natural look and make it seem as if I actually know what I am doing!</li>
            <li>Tenhos other stencils but are not that good and better than ever met.</li>
            <li>I have large, \\&quot;statement\\&quot; eyebrows and these stencils were HUGE!</li>
            <li>Most of the brows were too large for my face, but that&#x27;s why they give you a variety.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have a scar on my right eyebrow that I got as a kid (playing with a cousin, 4 stitches!)</li>
            <li>Truly recommend if you want to find the right shape of eyebrow for your face!</li>
            <li>This product came a week before expected shipping, so I was very pleased with that!</li>
            <li>To top my great experience off, the seller left a cute little note saying thank you for my purchase. :)</li>
            <li>stencils are nice shapes, but don&#x27;t really help you achieve that exact shape.</li>
            <li>These stencils are thicker than expected, but give a great look and shape to your brows.</li>
            <li>This made them look full and manicured.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, simple to use, practical, and convenient because of the size.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as cool as I thought.</li>
            <li>That said, you have to be talented enough to hold the stencils so that your application is symetrical.  </li>
            <li>Its good but its way smaller then</li>
            <li>The only good thing was it shipped</li>
            <li>and I love how much easier my brows are now.</li>
            <li>I can see them lasting a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Fun and precise.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good profuct and I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like these and my real brows look better than the out come of the stencil shape.</li>
            <li>So with this product you really have to find the one that fits your face shape, unfortunately most are not to going to work</li>
            <li>I wish they would sticker to your eyebrow area but overall a good product</li>
            <li>This has been true of all eyebrow stencils-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea, especially for those of us who find ourselves almost without eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The stencils themselves are nice enough and are easy to clean off because they&#x27;re plastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a very neat product and I love the brand.</li>
            <li>Work it from there to follow your own natural shape.</li>
            <li>These come in a pack of four and are good enough quality.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product though.</li>
            <li>it takes a little practice but its really easy and looks great.</li>
            <li>They are a nice plastic that bends easily to the contours of your face but is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t lose shape.</li>
            <li>(And I always thought I had pretty full brows!)</li>
            <li>Once you find the right one, it&#x27;s just a huge time saver.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s pretty easy</li>
            <li>but the stencils were easy to use and for a first timer in doing eyebrows myself</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re flexible and pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product for someone else, but it just wasn&#x27;t for someone like me with thick and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Great variety of shapes for those with not much eyebrow!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product - nice clear patterns easy to use and seems easy to last for awhile thanks</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>I wanted more of an arch, but wasn&#x27;t confident enough to free-hand tweeze</li>
            <li>These are much more realistic.</li>
            <li>I love this stencil kit, love trying different shape of my eyebrow and this thing help me a lot.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely quick-</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The package was sent and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Some may not be so lucky in that aspect.</li>
            <li>Some may not be so lucky in that aspect.</li>
            <li>I have uneven natural brows and these stencils are the first time I&#x27;ve been able to fill them in evenly AND perfectly!</li>
            <li>N water really works magic .. when it is damp it stick right on my skin and stays it place.</li>
            <li>They are really cheap, so if you&#x27;re interested than I guess you can go grab them, but I would not recommend them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thought this was a cool fun idea</li>
            <li>This item is pretty cool, they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works really well, hold up, is strong and not flimsy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only problem is the stencil plastic is really long so you have to play around a bit to get it perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; straight forward.</li>
            <li>I got these for a friend who is learning to do their own makeup and hair now and so far they have been a bonus addition to achieving great brows with little fuss!</li>
            <li>So, I was pretty excited about this product.</li>
            <li>I got it more than a week early than estimated !</li>
            <li>When I received so happy and they were stuck together, once I separated tried to use and it was a mess.  </li>
            <li>u get exactly what you order!nice price and product!</li>
            <li>Try lining them up with your own brows and lightly tracing the top of the brow outline with a small brush and a medium shade of brownish shadow.</li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>Nice shapes but hard to use on my own brows...</li>
            <li>and I found it looked very unnatural when I fully filled the stencil.</li>
            <li>The fast delivery is a huge plus as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many times to achieve a nice shape, but somehow it always comes out uneven.</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>Affordable and a useful tool for my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>When I open the package I saw that the stencils were the kind of material that maybe a sturdy cardboard maybe made of.</li>
            <li>but two of them actually looks really nice.</li>
            <li>The stencils are kind of big</li>
            <li>The product is sturdy and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I would prefer more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used stencils and rarely fill mine in, so I decided to buy these and see what&#x27;s to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth it, would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Must more durable and natural looking stencil (eyebrow) shapes.</li>
            <li>I can get a more natural looking shape to my brows now.</li>
            <li>it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth it for the fun factor?</li>
            <li>But I had an old set from ardell that was a lot better shapes.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Its so useful and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to follow I normally shade in the stencil and wax or shave the part that wasn&#x27;t shaded.</li>
            <li>When I try to use it I couldn&#x27;t get it to look right.</li>
            <li>but I have had to adjust and add to get the right shape for me.  </li>
            <li>the right way.  </li>
            <li>I never could do my brows right.</li>
            <li>You get the right shape every time.</li>
            <li>none of the stensils are the right size for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>You have to have the right product to do the filling, I use smashbox brow powder duo and set the powder with the wax.</li>
            <li>I can never get them in just the right spot.</li>
            <li>With this simple supply, I can make them look even and the filling is very easy.</li>
            <li>They also seem very large.</li>
            <li>these help so much to get them done right!</li>
            <li>I have always had less than perfect eyebrows and was hoping this stencil kit would solve my problem by incorporating it into my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>so I could see it easily and plucked outside of what I&#x27;d filled in.</li>
            <li>I used it several times and was satisfied with the effect, but after a week or so decided to go back to drawing my own outline.  </li>
            <li>A bit thinker than my previous set, but is a good quality</li>
            <li>the plastic stencil seemed like a good idea but the outer edges take up much of my face making it harder to trace my eyebrow&lt;</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast .. got it in 3 business days...</li>
            <li>The stencils are a bit smaller than my natural eyebrows, which are fairly thick, but by first doing the bottom and then moving the stencil up and doing the top, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>and I was willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product I just wish they would make another in a smaller size so I can use them too!</li>
            <li>I love that the pack is a variety of different shapes instead of job at one or two.</li>
            <li>I love the different shapes on the stencils.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and i really like this!</li>
            <li>Great product if your into thick brow shapes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this kit to make sure I was doing that as even as possible on both sides.</li>
            <li>is the only way you&#x27;ll be able to use them.</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows looked exactly like the stencil</li>
            <li>It is not too small for my eyebrows or too big, its the perfect size</li>
            <li>my first purchasing a dress on line</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows look on fleek ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>Using the same products, I&#x27;m able to achieve an eyebrow that lasts all day, which I couldn&#x27;t do before -</li>
            <li>fast!</li>
            <li>Today was my first day using it</li>
            <li>You have to be smart to use it the right way..</li>
            <li>This stencil kit is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>it was more hassle than necessary</li>
            <li>I covered my natural brows with glue and primer and drew on brows with the stencils and none of them fit my face</li>
            <li>The paper that was used for the stencils is pretty lightweight.</li>
            <li>but Not so much!</li>
            <li>It did accomplish what I needed, and a smart woman shouldn&#x27;t have to be told over and over how to paint her face, right?</li>
            <li>Very much appreciated!</li>
            <li>These eybrow stencils are great, but I think that they are a bit too square and thick though they helped me when I had close to no eyebrows</li>
            <li>Be sure to outline them both before you begin so you can get them as even as possible.</li>
            <li>Warning: do NOT buy these unless you have full brows with a strong natural arch- unless you plan to completely draw them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was okay, but maybe if it actually had some sticky-ness to it, would it really work.</li>
            <li>These are great to have to give you a good base shape for your brows when drawing them on.  </li>
            <li>They might be good to use if you can place them with some tape and fill in the stencil with some eyebrow powder just to how they look being a lot bigger and larger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that they were cheap because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Only two of the stencils actually look good with my face shape.</li>
            <li>will buy this products again and from this person because it was delivered quickly and with an unexpected gift!</li>
            <li>While they do look too large at first, when you &amp;#34;trace&amp;#34; inside the stencil, they will automatically not be as large as they look.</li>
            <li>cheap and not very user friendly</li>
            <li>Pretty much what it says on the tin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready so much quicker in the morning!</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and there are different shapes.</li>
            <li>They are reusable and with the thickness of the plastic/vinyl material the stencil can easily be wiped or cleaned if necessary.</li>
            <li>I thought it was pure skill</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about everyone else who says the stencils are too large, but for me they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use it at all, I like my eyebrows better when I follow the natural contour of my eyebrow and draw it in a little with an eyebrow pencil! :)</li>
            <li>this worked relatively well for me, as I was an avid over-plucker when left to my own devices.  </li>
            <li>These helped me pick a new shape for my natural brows and have made a huge change in how even my makeup looks</li>
            <li>But I guess if you have short lengthed eyebrows it works out fine</li>
            <li>I bought these because they are what we used in class to dye our clients eyebrows, and I think they will do however they are kind of a little flimsy and really do not hold their shape very well, so they are ok to use with eyebrow power, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>FAST delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to use these.</li>
            <li>Really like it if it will stick</li>
            <li>I never imagined how much time a line would save me.</li>
            <li>Try this product you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Really didnt help do not reccomend</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product is as described.</li>
            <li>I tried it the very night i got it</li>
            <li>additionally they don&#x27;t really stay in place as much as i would like</li>
            <li>If you use powder eyebrow color it doesn&#x27;t really fill in well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really get to much use out of them.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t really like any of the shapes that well</li>
            <li>Fast ship, like this product</li>
            <li>You will end up with something looking MUCH</li>
            <li>It works very well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use NYX brow pencil to lightly fill in by hand on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably going to throw this out or give it to someone...if I can find anyone who wants it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and this product!</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.</li>
            <li>It has 4 different stencils to fit every need of brows.</li>
            <li>Made my life a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>They have about 4 different forms to fit you brow style</li>
            <li>The pic online is not what they look like when you stencil them on,there&#x27;s no thin line part at the end</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it -</li>
            <li>I could never get my eyebrows the same trying to free hand</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t feel like I can complain much....</li>
            <li>I have a very slender brow.</li>
            <li>- the things were cheap and would definitely serve their purpose</li>
            <li>These Stencil Has been very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>Very disappionted.</li>
            <li>Used it once to shape my brows, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The stencils are too big and don&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this item</li>
            <li>I really like these stencils.</li>
            <li>Worked really well to help me get my eyebrows shaped again.</li>
            <li>It will work very well for those who take care of their eyebrows and have them correctly shaped.</li>
            <li>thanks soo much</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It requires real experimentation and practice to get the look you want.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>So, I saw a YouTube Guru (FamusLady) use this and looked on the e.l.f. website to see how much they were.</li>
            <li>However, It is not flimsy and it is very durable.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow stencil set comes with 4 different re-usable eyebrow stencil shapes, I think it is easy to use and saves you going to get your eyebrows plucked at a salon, however if you haven&#x27;t got a steady hand like me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to draw on symmetrical eyebrows, especially since mine aren&#x27;t naturally symmetrical.</li>
            <li>With Prime, as usual, shipping was super fast :)</li>
            <li>I have tried all the shapes and they are very normal size.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected and they are easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it and</li>
            <li>But other than that i love it</li>
            <li>I love E.L.F&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li>, I was SO excited only to see that they&#x27;re kind of flimsy and pretty freaking hard to use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have a high natural arch, but all of them where too flat and didn&#x27;t come close to fitting my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>But after a few times experimenting, I find them very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes with 4 stencils with different shapes: soft arch, structured arch, curved arch, and full arch!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use them because my brows aren&#x27;t full or arched enough.</li>
            <li>These are ok not very easy to use but they do work.</li>
            <li>I looked it up online and found this seller, and caught it at a time when I saved more than half of what I would&#x27;ve paid the manufacturers.</li>
            <li>This item came in very quickly and the packaging and contents were everything that I expected.</li>
            <li>I found it difficult to keep the stencil in one place while I used it, but someone with better eye makeup skills or a steadier hand would probably have more luck.</li>
            <li>Time of deliver was quick actually!</li>
            <li>When i tried it, im having hard time in using it and Its so hard to select the best stencil for me at first.</li>
            <li>They also come out super funky and lopsided; I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone actually having this shape.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my eyebrows, unlike the rest of me, have gotten thinner.</li>
            <li>stencil itself is a heavy but flexible clear plastic, which allows you to start with your own brow line.</li>
            <li>If you like your eyebrows a big bigger and fuller then you will be OK with this kit.</li>
            <li>very natural shapes!</li>
            <li>If my budget wasn&#x27;t so tight, I would be complaining a bit more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you are making a brow with minimal to no hair then this is fine</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in diy eyebrows and looking to save some money!</li>
            <li>Maybe with a little more practice using the stencils</li>
            <li>I love this little kit.  </li>
            <li>The stencils are kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>Great for grooming your brows too if you don&#x27;t need them for thin sparse brows!</li>
            <li>However I find that my head is no where near the size needed to make my brows look a reasonable size by utilizing this product.</li>
            <li>Make a great formed brow without looking fake.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Elf and this kit, my brows can look professionally done, all the time 👍</li>
            <li>The material of these stencils is a very bendable and soft plastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Helps get a rough shape, probably better if you barely have brows at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the heavy duty plastic it is.</li>
            <li>After I used it a few times I had the idea of what I wanted to do, so I don&#x27;t use it any more.  </li>
            <li>Now for the ELF stencil, its pretty much the same, excluding you have a variety and they are reuse-able.</li>
            <li>Overall worth the money though.</li>
            <li>Comes with different shapes and one of them was just right for me.</li>
            <li>And super long.</li>
            <li>If you want to try them out, I say it&#x27;s worth the money to see what they can actually do for you, after all, you may be really pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The stencils are a little long for my eyebrows, but the plastic they&#x27;e made from is durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, my only gripe is I think the stencils are very large</li>
            <li>These stencils are small enough to carry in your purse and easy to clean and care for.  </li>
            <li>The stencils came unbroken/ unripped brand new in the box.</li>
            <li>Neatly packaged &amp; new.</li>
            <li>and they still look new</li>
            <li>There are a few different reusable stencils of different shapes; I picked one, used it, and I have nice pretty eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Brushes and filling pencils slide easily under the plastic form which results in a mess and having to wash your face A LOT and start over.</li>
            <li>First of all the I noticed that the stencils do not have a line in the middle to help guide the shading unlike the sephora stencil.</li>
            <li>They are pretty sturdy to me, work well enough.</li>
            <li>I saw this on the elf site and wanted it, but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the almost ten dollars in shipping for a dollar product.</li>
            <li>so i filled it in dark</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I got a cutout made of paper!</li>
            <li>ACROSS THE EXACT SAME \\&quot;e.l.f. EYEBROW</li>
            <li>&quot; THE SAME EXACT ONE&#x27;S&lt;</li>
            <li>&quot; THEY SELL THIS SAME EXACT 4pc EYEBROW&lt;br /&gt;STENCIL</li>
            <li>It is useful for people whose eyebrows are not clearly defined.</li>
            <li>the shapes are nice though, but a little long.</li>
            <li>They bend easily and if you have trouble holding them just take some tape and place it exactly where you need it, out line your brow, and then pluck or shave whatever is outside of what you traced.</li>
            <li>There are definitely better out there, even for the price.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t long enough in the open shape to be an eyebrow and the surrounding &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are several different shapes, so the selection is adequate for any need.</li>
            <li>These are also not stiff plastic but</li>
            <li>My natural brows are just much much thinner than the size of these stencils, and I think drawing them on this large would make me look like a drag queen.</li>
            <li>therefore they lack shape (and yes I have tried plucking and waxing many times) needless to say it is hard to make them look good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I use the preferred stencil (My shape was the Structured Arch) and match it to my eyebrows before fill them in using a white eyeliner pencil (or a very dark colored eyeliner); making sure that both of my eyebrows are lined up evenly after shading them in.</li>
            <li>i bought these brows for my teen because shes been having a hard time making her own thick brows even and appealing</li>
            <li>i used the clear ones.</li>
            <li>I filled in with brow pencil, carefully plucked all hairs outside the shape, then removed all the pencil.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically a waste of time and money, but again, it is cheap, like..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, since about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve had problems with over plucking and just now managed to get them to grow fully back after 4 months of really trying.</li>
            <li>BUT i fixed that problem by damping the stencil before i put it in place..</li>
            <li>product makes my eyebrows look natural, (</li>
            <li>like my old eyebrows -  RIP..sniff sniff)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shape them to keep their natural shape, tweeze so you dont have a unibrow, and apply powder along the natural shape.  </li>
            <li>eyebrows look professional.</li>
            <li>This has totally made my life much easier.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My brows look even, professional, and somehow fuller</li>
            <li>Every shape looks natural and defined.</li>
            <li>These seem like they would mold to your face well to fill your eyebrows, but that isn&#x27;t helpful when none of them come even close to the natural shape of your eyebrow.</li>
            <li>the all made my brows start in to close or extend way too far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one so far</li>
            <li>My brows were WAY smaller than the stencil, so they didn&#x27;t really work well with mine,</li>
            <li>As far as the effects that the stencils are made to achieve they do that.</li>
            <li>and when i shaded in my eyebrow powder my eyebrows came out with extremely thick shading even though i had made sure that the stencil was on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are rather on the thin side and after I use the stencils I have to fatten them up a bit but overall, good stuff.</li>
            <li>I always had a problem with ELF makeup in general, Don&#x27;t wast your money!!!</li>
            <li>but these stencils just don&#x27;t work well for most average women, with average sized faced which have natural eyebrows and normal sized foreheads.</li>
            <li>I saw a photo of myself and realized that it really didn&#x27;t look so great on me - I probably just picked the wrong stencil, and made it too dark.</li>
            <li>No more crooked lines:)</li>
            <li>Way too long and large.</li>
            <li>It was on time and a little early its good just have a hard time holding it and shading it in</li>
            <li>With four different stencils to choose from, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have made the grave mistake back in high school to overpluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I would place the stencil over my eyebrows and it&#x27;s so small compared to the stencil so I filled in what I could</li>
            <li>it is ok ,but not v good</li>
            <li>Although, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but that is my fault.</li>
            <li>Way way way to big for normal eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I put stencil in place and use a very light eyebrow powder to lay down the basic shape, then I come back with Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade to finish filling in properly.  </li>
            <li>As long as you keep the stencil in the same spot (which honestly is super simple)</li>
            <li>A little more flimsy that expected</li>
            <li>These stencils are cut from thick plastic and are pretty sturdy; the various shapes available should be enough to please anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the shapes but was looking for something that was smaller, since it makes it hard to use them.</li>
            <li>Hold template of choice on brow and color in with a white eyeliner pencil to define the \\&quot;new brow\\&quot;position on your existing eyebrow.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STINCIL, HELPS ME KEEP MY BROW LINE STRAIGHT SINCE I AM UNABLE TO SEE WITHOUT MY GLASSES</li>
            <li>, you have to place it just right, then tape it down and hope it doesn&#x27;t move out of place.</li>
            <li>Had they fit they would have been at least a four.</li>
            <li>, there is like no in between so this kit is of no use to me personally because my eyebrows are no where near the size or shape of the stencils in this kit.</li>
            <li>I probably just need lots of practice with them, but will have to modify for plucking since they are much too wide.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t be deceived; you can go directly to the ELF wesbite, and get thsi SAME set for $1!</li>
            <li>I would only suggest buying if you have larger than normal eyebrows..</li>
            <li>And most of them too thin.</li>
            <li>They are a thick material and are comfortable to place on your face, and are bendable.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s kind of silly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this the only thing is that I have a very small face and short eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Great for me, but a little weird also.</li>
            <li>The stencils are very helpful because it is hard for me to see up close with out glasses, so this helps me to keep my brow line straight...</li>
            <li>Once you have painted both brows with the white eyeliner pencil (You have to buy white pencil seperately) then pluck around the new drawn shape and wash white off.</li>
            <li>but you do have to be careful to not flex them too much while you hold them or they stretch open</li>
            <li>A must have if you have trouble starting your eyebrows or filling them in properly they&#x27;re thick enough but also flexible enough so you can get a good mold of your brow bone when you&#x27;re trying to fill the man</li>
            <li>I used to be so bad at doing my eyebrows, but now everyone says they are amazing!</li>
            <li>The stencils were all to long and none of them came close to the shape of my natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li>One good thing is they weren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li>This is a good idea but very difficult to use.</li>
            <li>These stencils are a tad small, so I need to move them around when I do my brow to get the right shape.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have a natural arch shaped brow and these make your brows look really long with a short arch at the end</li>
            <li>Since my face is not flat, this is difficult to use, but it did give me a pattern to work on that was better than me using my imagination to try to figure out if both eyes looked the same or were the shape I wanted.  </li>

            <li> This is a great idea and concept for beginners like myself</li>
            <li> O tried it a couple of times…  not that great</li>
            <li> These might have been great...</li>
            <li> This is a great guide to fill in eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great stencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I needed an eyebrow stencil until I added this to an order just to increase the price to get my add on items delivered lol.</li>
            <li> and this works great</li>
            <li> stencils worked great for me, but I can understand how some individuals can have issues with it.</li>
            <li> stencils worked great for me, but I can understand how some individuals can have issues with it.</li>
            <li> im so happy</li>
            <li> Great instructions &amp; tips</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I just love them they are so awesome and do a great job</li>
            <li> This stencil set is amazing!</li>
            <li> The results were just amazing!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look amazing from it!</li>
            <li> Amazing price!</li>
            <li> Nice surprise!</li>
            <li> Then I fill in the top of the line freehand to make nice eyebrows on both sides, just having the line to start saves me hours of drawing, erasing, redrawing, ect because NO ONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL FACE!!!</li>
            <li> I used these stencils about two times because I learned how to shape my eyebrows on my own!</li>
            <li> Although not all of the stencils are meant for me, the one that I found most helpful was a great guideline the shape of my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> After many deliberations in choosing an Eyebrow Stencil Kit, this one seem like the best</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out the best but ok.</li>
            <li> very nice good quality</li>
            <li> Easy eyebrows, even and perfectly shaped every time.</li>
            <li> The best part is their plastic texture which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> so this wasn&#x27;t a suprise that it works so good for me.</li>
            <li> If you have a longer and wider brow line, this would be good for you.</li>
            <li> Received product as described in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;product is good, makes it easier to shape my brow.</li>
            <li> It may not even look good on you.  </li>
            <li> Even men need to have good eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners...</li>
            <li> It will make those eyebrows look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It was a good product.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it works so good.</li>
            <li> One of them fit my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li> I loved the results.</li>
            <li> I could do my eye brows and it looks good every time I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Incredible magic</li>
            <li> my eye brown look so good</li>
            <li> Good, but not for me....</li>
            <li> Didnt look good.</li>
            <li> These are a really good idea.</li>
            <li> None of the sizes or arches looked good on me.  </li>
            <li> BUT, much to my pleasant surprise, these work fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Nice price with nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these will give you beautiful results</li>

            <li> I liked it because it fit me perfectly.</li>

            <li> Nice and cheap , very effective!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked E.L.F. products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I preferred and found I liked just drawing my own.</li>
            <li> Some ladies liked squared eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I like that the stencil will let u get a nice shaped eyebrow</li>
            <li> I have nice, fuller brows</li>
            <li> though to be honest i know already to do my own eyebrows</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and was a nice price.</li>
            <li> With this, you must buy some kind of powder to accompany it.  </li>
            <li> for look nice  go out dinner or party or with my bf ..</li>
            <li> got this item in a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> An adhesive of some kind would have been nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seemed like they would be awesome, but they are really flemsy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit.  </li>
            <li> Nice shapes, close to my own.  </li>
            <li> These stencils are nice-</li>
            <li> They give a nice variety of shapes.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I appreciate what E.L.F was trying to do with this</li>
            <li> I tried them out and wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Nice shapes</li>
            <li> The brush is nice for applying, you have the spiral brush for combing and the wax for setting.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils aren&#x27;t cheaply made, they&#x27;re actually very nice.  </li>
            <li> and I am actually REALLY EXCITED!!</li>
            <li> Anastasia high arch is still the best for me.</li>
            <li> Great, if you&#x27;re like me that doesn&#x27;t know how to make a perfect brow, these sheets just make it easy, and there&#x27;s different brows shapes, use the one that fit you most!!</li>
            <li> well this kit is good and easy to use,u can bring anywhere</li>
            <li> They worked great with all kinds of brow powders - a thicker brush gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it came quickly &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li> It’s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and durable....</li>
            <li> This might be good for people with huge bushy eyebrows, but mine are a lot thinner than the stencils.</li>
            <li> The thinnest one matched my natural arch best</li>
            <li> The shape is exactly as it should be and beautiful.</li>
            <li> none of the stencils were a good fit..</li>
            <li> okay, I think that I would think twice again for paying almost $6 for 4 pieces of plastic eyebrow shapes, that I could honestly just cut off from the internet....</li>
            <li> it will get more effective.</li>
            <li> I find that I like the colored stick on kind better.</li>
            <li> and i recommend anyone whos new to eyebrow shaping or even someone who has for awhile that still get there eyesbrows pretty cricked to try lol its wonderful</li>
            <li> I was looking for set that would be easy to use and that would save me some $ from getting my eyebrows done at the salon!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the plastic material is bendable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see a couple wider and (especially) more natural arches.</li>
            <li> Great reusble, easy to clean product.</li>
            <li> Perfect to get general shape</li>
            <li> but everything else was fine!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and did not like the sketch styles.</li>
            <li> Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend.</li>
            <li> Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is a nice quality product that is easy to use.</li>
            <li> With these, it doesn&#x27;t get it perfect right away, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close</li>
            <li> I love the eyebrow stencils, so easy to use since i&#x27;m no make-up artist to fill them in on my own.</li>
            <li> I love it already and just got it yesterday</li>
            <li> They are ok.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been better if it came with instructions or tips.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, as it does involve patience and focus, I love it though :)</li>
            <li> I can achieve my look better freehand than I can with these.</li>
            <li> But somehow may face looks better with shaped eyebrows than unshaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the time I am tempted to just shave them off and get them tattooed on</li>
            <li> If you are able to pull off an anime face or celebrity look because you have no eyebrows and paint them on then</li>
            <li> if u are beginners and want to have your own technique to learn u should try to use this.the price is cheap and every women out there for sure can afford it.(wink)</li>
            <li> As I age, I notice that my eyebrows are getting more sparse and look lighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have been using these stencils for weeks now and just love them!&lt;br /&gt;All of</li>
            <li> Gonna try that and see what happens, then I&#x27;ll be able to give a better review of how they work.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get a better arch.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> Love all elf stuff :)</li>
            <li> Wish stencils were made of more durable and firmer plastic.</li>
            <li> then make sure the two connect.</li>
            <li> Loved the variety and they&#x27;re doing me really good so far. :)</li>
            <li> It is durable and can be used many times.</li>
            <li> These have been helpful in getting a more identical shape</li>
            <li> better do it freehand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend creating your own stencils that will fit your face and shape.</li>
            <li> WOUD COST ME MORE</li>
            <li> I can tell that 2 or 3 more times using this</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> Might be better for someone else.</li>
            <li> I am able to do it.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Guess i should be glad refund was given.</li>
            <li> I take my thumb and index finger to hold the top of the stencil along my brow, then trace my brow with a brown eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> fast lol</li>
            <li> See Francios Nars book on eyebrows for a better how-to.</li>
            <li> These would be OK, if I wanted clown brows.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can play with it some more, but I just don&#x27;t think this item is for me.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They look SO much better than they used to.</li>
            <li> I love these stencils because without them filling my eyebrows would be a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> I love the concept.</li>
            <li> so they should fit all faces no matter the shape or size!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get both brows identical with just my pencils</li>
            <li> fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the ELF  products...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the shape, either.</li>
            <li> Found my personal perfect eyebrow shape in this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to freehand anymore :)  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just time consuming :)</li>
            <li> I guess for women who have this shape, the stencils will work ok.</li>
            <li> but you will eventually find one that works for you and you will love it :)</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> AND SOME OF&lt;br /&gt;THE \\&quot;KITS\\&quot; COULD COST UP TO $50.00 OR MORE DOLLARS BECAUSE</li>
            <li> Love these stencils..</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to give a more appealing shape to me eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They are ok, not what I thought they would be</li>
            <li> For sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Now my eye brows stylish:)</li>
            <li> I picked out my favorite</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wipe it off before and after each use.  </li>
            <li> i love this eyebrow stencil kit.</li>
            <li> are the perfect way to shape your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love It.......</li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> so I could see what I was doing better.</li>
            <li> I love that this kit has a variety of arches to choose from.  </li>
            <li> The different shapes are AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom, she loves them :)</li>
            <li> and now they&#x27;re sitting in the unused make-up graveyard which is the trash. :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t creative with using these stencils, you could end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> So, I looked on Amazon instead and got a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, They are some eyebrow tutorials on Youtube that talks about how to properly fill in eyebrows, be sure to check them out and see which method works best for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Luck. :)</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these stencils at first.</li>
            <li> They are pretty shapes for eyebrows, really good price and durable.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchase I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> If you like your eyebrows think and long then these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Straightforward with a variety of brow shapes to use!</li>
            <li> I love it, my eyebrows are even and easy to put on..</li>
            <li> I like the shapes and they are very easy to clean</li>
            <li> i am so excited to test this out for an big party tonight :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this because it turns out not as huge as some reviewer said.</li>
            <li> so I just use the top line to shape the brow and fill in the rest free hand.</li>
            <li> If I could find a better fit I would trade these in.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to give this product 5 stars because it does work, quite well infact, and was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great for shaping natural eyebrows</li>
            <li> I use it to apply a light guide to make sure I get my brows an even shape.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t pluck for a while and grew as much of my eyebrows back as I could, then tried each of the 4 stencils out by filling in with an eyebrow pencil to see which I liked best.</li>
            <li> I can do it better free hand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t likethe outlines they didn&#x27;t really look good.</li>
            <li> I really love how easy to use and accurate this product is.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep in place.</li>
            <li> the stencils work well for me, and they are so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super easy, and affective.</li>
            <li> This product is not as easy to use as I thought but after some time I did get the desired result.</li>
            <li> I like the different shapes this kit contains, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> The stencils are well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The paper stencils are flimsy and rip easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it is flexible and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll rip easily.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> I also felt that the soft plastic, although good to conform to your face shape, may easily become warped over time, as there is nothing connecting the arch like most eyebrow stencils.</li>
            <li> The stencils are flimsy plastic and do not stay on the brow easily when I try to fill in the stencil area.</li>
            <li> It is a great help to have the stencils to help you make sure that both brows are the same length and thickness.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are for the most part full but have like no arch</li>
            <li> I think after I use them for a few more months, I&#x27;ll learn to do it on my own, but until then, these stencils are great.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li> I freehand fine and get lots of compliments that way</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed with these stencils.</li>
            <li> For a dollar it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of time to do your makeup, then they will probably work fine for you.</li>
            <li> bought these for only one of the stencils that looked pretty close to my ideal brow shape, and the one I felt like I could most easily pull</li>
            <li> but quick shipping and package came with no problem!</li>
            <li> Love that you get 4 different stencils and the directions were good and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> They were all so huge that I</li>
            <li> The stencils are HUGE.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and you have to cut the edges to fit</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t work as great as I thought.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t fit your face.</li>
            <li> but these give my brows a fabulous shape.</li>
            <li> , like none of them felt like they fit my face.</li>
            <li> Accept your real brow, tidy up stray hairs, and do them with a shadow and a setting wax or gel.  </li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t fit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and i have no regrets.prefect fit ..</li>
            <li> You can also use a lighter brown or color of choice pencil to draw the eyebrow, remove the stencil, and fill in with light upward and outward strokes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my face at all</li>
            <li> I clean easy.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say I really didn&#x27;t expect a lot in ordering these as they aren&#x27;t even 5 bucks?</li>
            <li> This was a great idea but it limits the style and shape for your individual brows.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap though, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> but I can make adjustments free hand.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s become faster than free handing with pencils or powders alone.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look fantastic</li>
            <li> but there is understandably no way to make a fit for everyone</li>
            <li> For me, nothing fit, I even tried trimming, they will end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to use my Tarte architect brow pencil free</li>
            <li> /&gt;i end up just free handing it which take a bit longer</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they fit my shape of eyebrows and we a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> lol I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> and I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It would also be much easier to use if there were some kind of adhesive and/or a guide to placement.</li>
            <li> The stencil worked great for me to practice on what the final view should look like.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and was packaged nicely, thank you</li>
            <li> immeadiately after the brows are filled in.</li>
            <li> It is very economical as far as being able to do your own brows rather than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> I liked that the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> Other than that they are perfect and would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking eyebrows</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and thought it would be cool to have and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this as means for a guide as in using the bottom or top, just a little at first, that would be best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of these stencils are nice and the box it comes with is very easy to open.</li>
            <li> Super easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and all you do and trace the shape onto your eyebrow and fill in the rest.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and nice, I just don&#x27;t know how to apply it fully, I&#x27;m new though.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to shape and/or fill in your own brow to get a natural looking result.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I got these to try to help shape my eyebrows into a thicker shape and they were way thinner than what I originally have.</li>
            <li> Your eyebrows are unique for your face.  </li>
            <li> they are not user friendly at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> My original order of this product was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth having this in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> But besides that the product is good, easily bent to lay flat on the face, but durable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure i would be able to position these stencils so that they were natural looking .</li>
            <li> Whenever i try to do my eyebrows free handed, they end up looking horrendous and super drawn on.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, kind of big for my face.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the kit itself looks fantastic and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I get one a bit off kilter, but have always been able to fix ithem easily, by manipulating the way I hold it, or using a q-tip to clean up around the edges a bit.&lt;br /&gt;These stencils give a very nice, natural look and make it seem as if I actually know what I am doing!</li>
            <li> Tenhos other stencils but are not that good and better than ever met.</li>
            <li> I have large, \\&quot;statement\\&quot; eyebrows and these stencils were HUGE!</li>
            <li> Most of the brows were too large for my face, but that&#x27;s why they give you a variety.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my right eyebrow that I got as a kid (playing with a cousin, 4 stitches!)</li>
            <li> Truly recommend if you want to find the right shape of eyebrow for your face!</li>
            <li> This product came a week before expected shipping, so I was very pleased with that!</li>
            <li> To top my great experience off, the seller left a cute little note saying thank you for my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> stencils are nice shapes, but don&#x27;t really help you achieve that exact shape.</li>
            <li> These stencils are thicker than expected, but give a great look and shape to your brows.</li>
            <li> This made them look full and manicured.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, simple to use, practical, and convenient because of the size.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as cool as I thought.</li>
            <li> That said, you have to be talented enough to hold the stencils so that your application is symetrical.  </li>
            <li> Its good but its way smaller then</li>
            <li> The only good thing was it shipped</li>
            <li> and I love how much easier my brows are now.</li>
            <li> I can see them lasting a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Fun and precise.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good profuct and I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like these and my real brows look better than the out come of the stencil shape.</li>
            <li> So with this product you really have to find the one that fits your face shape, unfortunately most are not to going to work</li>
            <li> I wish they would sticker to your eyebrow area but overall a good product</li>
            <li> This has been true of all eyebrow stencils-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, especially for those of us who find ourselves almost without eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The stencils themselves are nice enough and are easy to clean off because they&#x27;re plastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a very neat product and I love the brand.</li>
            <li> Work it from there to follow your own natural shape.</li>
            <li> These come in a pack of four and are good enough quality.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product though.</li>
            <li> it takes a little practice but its really easy and looks great.</li>
            <li> They are a nice plastic that bends easily to the contours of your face but is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t lose shape.</li>
            <li> (And I always thought I had pretty full brows!)</li>
            <li> Once you find the right one, it&#x27;s just a huge time saver.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s pretty easy</li>
            <li> but the stencils were easy to use and for a first timer in doing eyebrows myself</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re flexible and pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product for someone else, but it just wasn&#x27;t for someone like me with thick and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great variety of shapes for those with not much eyebrow!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product - nice clear patterns easy to use and seems easy to last for awhile thanks</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> I wanted more of an arch, but wasn&#x27;t confident enough to free-hand tweeze</li>
            <li> These are much more realistic.</li>
            <li> I love this stencil kit, love trying different shape of my eyebrow and this thing help me a lot.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely quick-</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The package was sent and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Some may not be so lucky in that aspect.</li>
            <li> Some may not be so lucky in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I have uneven natural brows and these stencils are the first time I&#x27;ve been able to fill them in evenly AND perfectly!</li>
            <li> N water really works magic .. when it is damp it stick right on my skin and stays it place.</li>
            <li> They are really cheap, so if you&#x27;re interested than I guess you can go grab them, but I would not recommend them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought this was a cool fun idea</li>
            <li> This item is pretty cool, they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works really well, hold up, is strong and not flimsy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only problem is the stencil plastic is really long so you have to play around a bit to get it perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; straight forward.</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend who is learning to do their own makeup and hair now and so far they have been a bonus addition to achieving great brows with little fuss!</li>
            <li> So, I was pretty excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I got it more than a week early than estimated !</li>
            <li> When I received so happy and they were stuck together, once I separated tried to use and it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> u get exactly what you order!nice price and product!</li>
            <li> Try lining them up with your own brows and lightly tracing the top of the brow outline with a small brush and a medium shade of brownish shadow.</li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> Nice shapes but hard to use on my own brows...</li>
            <li> and I found it looked very unnatural when I fully filled the stencil.</li>
            <li> The fast delivery is a huge plus as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many times to achieve a nice shape, but somehow it always comes out uneven.</li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> Affordable and a useful tool for my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> When I open the package I saw that the stencils were the kind of material that maybe a sturdy cardboard maybe made of.</li>
            <li> but two of them actually looks really nice.</li>
            <li> The stencils are kind of big</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used stencils and rarely fill mine in, so I decided to buy these and see what&#x27;s to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth it, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Must more durable and natural looking stencil (eyebrow) shapes.</li>
            <li> I can get a more natural looking shape to my brows now.</li>
            <li> it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth it for the fun factor?</li>
            <li> But I had an old set from ardell that was a lot better shapes.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Its so useful and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to follow I normally shade in the stencil and wax or shave the part that wasn&#x27;t shaded.</li>
            <li> When I try to use it I couldn&#x27;t get it to look right.</li>
            <li> but I have had to adjust and add to get the right shape for me.  </li>
            <li> the right way.  </li>
            <li> I never could do my brows right.</li>
            <li> You get the right shape every time.</li>
            <li> none of the stensils are the right size for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> You have to have the right product to do the filling, I use smashbox brow powder duo and set the powder with the wax.</li>
            <li> I can never get them in just the right spot.</li>
            <li> With this simple supply, I can make them look even and the filling is very easy.</li>
            <li> They also seem very large.</li>
            <li> these help so much to get them done right!</li>
            <li> I have always had less than perfect eyebrows and was hoping this stencil kit would solve my problem by incorporating it into my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> so I could see it easily and plucked outside of what I&#x27;d filled in.</li>
            <li> I used it several times and was satisfied with the effect, but after a week or so decided to go back to drawing my own outline.  </li>
            <li> A bit thinker than my previous set, but is a good quality</li>
            <li> the plastic stencil seemed like a good idea but the outer edges take up much of my face making it harder to trace my eyebrow&lt;</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast .. got it in 3 business days...</li>
            <li> The stencils are a bit smaller than my natural eyebrows, which are fairly thick, but by first doing the bottom and then moving the stencil up and doing the top, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> and I was willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the product I just wish they would make another in a smaller size so I can use them too!</li>
            <li> I love that the pack is a variety of different shapes instead of job at one or two.</li>
            <li> I love the different shapes on the stencils.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and i really like this!</li>
            <li> Great product if your into thick brow shapes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this kit to make sure I was doing that as even as possible on both sides.</li>
            <li> is the only way you&#x27;ll be able to use them.</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows looked exactly like the stencil</li>
            <li> It is not too small for my eyebrows or too big, its the perfect size</li>
            <li> my first purchasing a dress on line</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows look on fleek ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> Using the same products, I&#x27;m able to achieve an eyebrow that lasts all day, which I couldn&#x27;t do before -</li>
            <li> fast!</li>
            <li> Today was my first day using it</li>
            <li> You have to be smart to use it the right way..</li>
            <li> This stencil kit is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> it was more hassle than necessary</li>
            <li> I covered my natural brows with glue and primer and drew on brows with the stencils and none of them fit my face</li>
            <li> The paper that was used for the stencils is pretty lightweight.</li>
            <li> but Not so much!</li>
            <li> It did accomplish what I needed, and a smart woman shouldn&#x27;t have to be told over and over how to paint her face, right?</li>
            <li> Very much appreciated!</li>
            <li> These eybrow stencils are great, but I think that they are a bit too square and thick though they helped me when I had close to no eyebrows</li>
            <li> Be sure to outline them both before you begin so you can get them as even as possible.</li>
            <li> Warning: do NOT buy these unless you have full brows with a strong natural arch- unless you plan to completely draw them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was okay, but maybe if it actually had some sticky-ness to it, would it really work.</li>
            <li> These are great to have to give you a good base shape for your brows when drawing them on.  </li>
            <li> They might be good to use if you can place them with some tape and fill in the stencil with some eyebrow powder just to how they look being a lot bigger and larger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that they were cheap because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Only two of the stencils actually look good with my face shape.</li>
            <li> will buy this products again and from this person because it was delivered quickly and with an unexpected gift!</li>
            <li> While they do look too large at first, when you &amp;#34;trace&amp;#34; inside the stencil, they will automatically not be as large as they look.</li>
            <li> cheap and not very user friendly</li>
            <li> Pretty much what it says on the tin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready so much quicker in the morning!</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and there are different shapes.</li>
            <li> They are reusable and with the thickness of the plastic/vinyl material the stencil can easily be wiped or cleaned if necessary.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pure skill</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about everyone else who says the stencils are too large, but for me they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it at all, I like my eyebrows better when I follow the natural contour of my eyebrow and draw it in a little with an eyebrow pencil! :)</li>
            <li> this worked relatively well for me, as I was an avid over-plucker when left to my own devices.  </li>
            <li> These helped me pick a new shape for my natural brows and have made a huge change in how even my makeup looks</li>
            <li> But I guess if you have short lengthed eyebrows it works out fine</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are what we used in class to dye our clients eyebrows, and I think they will do however they are kind of a little flimsy and really do not hold their shape very well, so they are ok to use with eyebrow power, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> FAST delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to use these.</li>
            <li> Really like it if it will stick</li>
            <li> I never imagined how much time a line would save me.</li>
            <li> Try this product you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Really didnt help do not reccomend</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product is as described.</li>
            <li> I tried it the very night i got it</li>
            <li> additionally they don&#x27;t really stay in place as much as i would like</li>
            <li> If you use powder eyebrow color it doesn&#x27;t really fill in well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really get to much use out of them.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t really like any of the shapes that well</li>
            <li> Fast ship, like this product</li>
            <li> You will end up with something looking MUCH</li>
            <li> It works very well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use NYX brow pencil to lightly fill in by hand on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably going to throw this out or give it to someone...if I can find anyone who wants it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller and this product!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.</li>
            <li> It has 4 different stencils to fit every need of brows.</li>
            <li> Made my life a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> They have about 4 different forms to fit you brow style</li>
            <li> The pic online is not what they look like when you stencil them on,there&#x27;s no thin line part at the end</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it -</li>
            <li> I could never get my eyebrows the same trying to free hand</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t feel like I can complain much....</li>
            <li> I have a very slender brow.</li>
            <li> - the things were cheap and would definitely serve their purpose</li>
            <li> These Stencil Has been very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Very disappionted.</li>
            <li> Used it once to shape my brows, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The stencils are too big and don&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
            <li> These work very well</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this item</li>
            <li> I really like these stencils.</li>
            <li> Worked really well to help me get my eyebrows shaped again.</li>
            <li> It will work very well for those who take care of their eyebrows and have them correctly shaped.</li>
            <li> thanks soo much</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It requires real experimentation and practice to get the look you want.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> So, I saw a YouTube Guru (FamusLady) use this and looked on the e.l.f. website to see how much they were.</li>
            <li> However, It is not flimsy and it is very durable.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow stencil set comes with 4 different re-usable eyebrow stencil shapes, I think it is easy to use and saves you going to get your eyebrows plucked at a salon, however if you haven&#x27;t got a steady hand like me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to draw on symmetrical eyebrows, especially since mine aren&#x27;t naturally symmetrical.</li>
            <li> With Prime, as usual, shipping was super fast :)</li>
            <li> I have tried all the shapes and they are very normal size.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected and they are easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it and</li>
            <li> But other than that i love it</li>
            <li> I love E.L.F&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li> , I was SO excited only to see that they&#x27;re kind of flimsy and pretty freaking hard to use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have a high natural arch, but all of them where too flat and didn&#x27;t come close to fitting my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> But after a few times experimenting, I find them very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes with 4 stencils with different shapes: soft arch, structured arch, curved arch, and full arch!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use them because my brows aren&#x27;t full or arched enough.</li>
            <li> These are ok not very easy to use but they do work.</li>
            <li> I looked it up online and found this seller, and caught it at a time when I saved more than half of what I would&#x27;ve paid the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> This item came in very quickly and the packaging and contents were everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to keep the stencil in one place while I used it, but someone with better eye makeup skills or a steadier hand would probably have more luck.</li>
            <li> Time of deliver was quick actually!</li>
            <li> When i tried it, im having hard time in using it and Its so hard to select the best stencil for me at first.</li>
            <li> They also come out super funky and lopsided; I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone actually having this shape.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my eyebrows, unlike the rest of me, have gotten thinner.</li>
            <li> stencil itself is a heavy but flexible clear plastic, which allows you to start with your own brow line.</li>
            <li> If you like your eyebrows a big bigger and fuller then you will be OK with this kit.</li>
            <li> very natural shapes!</li>
            <li> If my budget wasn&#x27;t so tight, I would be complaining a bit more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you are making a brow with minimal to no hair then this is fine</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in diy eyebrows and looking to save some money!</li>
            <li> Maybe with a little more practice using the stencils</li>
            <li> I love this little kit.  </li>
            <li> The stencils are kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming your brows too if you don&#x27;t need them for thin sparse brows!</li>
            <li> However I find that my head is no where near the size needed to make my brows look a reasonable size by utilizing this product.</li>
            <li> Make a great formed brow without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Elf and this kit, my brows can look professionally done, all the time 👍</li>
            <li> The material of these stencils is a very bendable and soft plastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Helps get a rough shape, probably better if you barely have brows at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the heavy duty plastic it is.</li>
            <li> After I used it a few times I had the idea of what I wanted to do, so I don&#x27;t use it any more.  </li>
            <li> Now for the ELF stencil, its pretty much the same, excluding you have a variety and they are reuse-able.</li>
            <li> Overall worth the money though.</li>
            <li> Comes with different shapes and one of them was just right for me.</li>
            <li> And super long.</li>
            <li> If you want to try them out, I say it&#x27;s worth the money to see what they can actually do for you, after all, you may be really pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The stencils are a little long for my eyebrows, but the plastic they&#x27;e made from is durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> , my only gripe is I think the stencils are very large</li>
            <li> These stencils are small enough to carry in your purse and easy to clean and care for.  </li>
            <li> The stencils came unbroken/ unripped brand new in the box.</li>
            <li> Neatly packaged &amp; new.</li>
            <li> and they still look new</li>
            <li> There are a few different reusable stencils of different shapes; I picked one, used it, and I have nice pretty eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Brushes and filling pencils slide easily under the plastic form which results in a mess and having to wash your face A LOT and start over.</li>
            <li> First of all the I noticed that the stencils do not have a line in the middle to help guide the shading unlike the sephora stencil.</li>
            <li> They are pretty sturdy to me, work well enough.</li>
            <li> I saw this on the elf site and wanted it, but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the almost ten dollars in shipping for a dollar product.</li>
            <li> so i filled it in dark</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got a cutout made of paper!</li>
            <li> ACROSS THE EXACT SAME \\&quot;e.l.f. EYEBROW</li>
            <li> &quot; THE SAME EXACT ONE&#x27;S&lt;</li>
            <li> &quot; THEY SELL THIS SAME EXACT 4pc EYEBROW&lt;br /&gt;STENCIL</li>
            <li> It is useful for people whose eyebrows are not clearly defined.</li>
            <li> the shapes are nice though, but a little long.</li>
            <li> They bend easily and if you have trouble holding them just take some tape and place it exactly where you need it, out line your brow, and then pluck or shave whatever is outside of what you traced.</li>
            <li> There are definitely better out there, even for the price.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t long enough in the open shape to be an eyebrow and the surrounding &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are several different shapes, so the selection is adequate for any need.</li>
            <li> These are also not stiff plastic but</li>
            <li> My natural brows are just much much thinner than the size of these stencils, and I think drawing them on this large would make me look like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> therefore they lack shape (and yes I have tried plucking and waxing many times) needless to say it is hard to make them look good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I use the preferred stencil (My shape was the Structured Arch) and match it to my eyebrows before fill them in using a white eyeliner pencil (or a very dark colored eyeliner); making sure that both of my eyebrows are lined up evenly after shading them in.</li>
            <li> i bought these brows for my teen because shes been having a hard time making her own thick brows even and appealing</li>
            <li> i used the clear ones.</li>
            <li> I filled in with brow pencil, carefully plucked all hairs outside the shape, then removed all the pencil.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically a waste of time and money, but again, it is cheap, like..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, since about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve had problems with over plucking and just now managed to get them to grow fully back after 4 months of really trying.</li>
            <li> BUT i fixed that problem by damping the stencil before i put it in place..</li>
            <li> product makes my eyebrows look natural, (</li>
            <li> like my old eyebrows -  RIP..sniff sniff)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shape them to keep their natural shape, tweeze so you dont have a unibrow, and apply powder along the natural shape.  </li>
            <li> eyebrows look professional.</li>
            <li> This has totally made my life much easier.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My brows look even, professional, and somehow fuller</li>
            <li> Every shape looks natural and defined.</li>
            <li> These seem like they would mold to your face well to fill your eyebrows, but that isn&#x27;t helpful when none of them come even close to the natural shape of your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> the all made my brows start in to close or extend way too far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one so far</li>
            <li> My brows were WAY smaller than the stencil, so they didn&#x27;t really work well with mine,</li>
            <li> As far as the effects that the stencils are made to achieve they do that.</li>
            <li> and when i shaded in my eyebrow powder my eyebrows came out with extremely thick shading even though i had made sure that the stencil was on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are rather on the thin side and after I use the stencils I have to fatten them up a bit but overall, good stuff.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with ELF makeup in general, Don&#x27;t wast your money!!!</li>
            <li> but these stencils just don&#x27;t work well for most average women, with average sized faced which have natural eyebrows and normal sized foreheads.</li>
            <li> I saw a photo of myself and realized that it really didn&#x27;t look so great on me - I probably just picked the wrong stencil, and made it too dark.</li>
            <li> No more crooked lines:)</li>
            <li> Way too long and large.</li>
            <li> It was on time and a little early its good just have a hard time holding it and shading it in</li>
            <li> With four different stencils to choose from, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have made the grave mistake back in high school to overpluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I would place the stencil over my eyebrows and it&#x27;s so small compared to the stencil so I filled in what I could</li>
            <li> it is ok ,but not v good</li>
            <li> Although, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but that is my fault.</li>
            <li> Way way way to big for normal eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I put stencil in place and use a very light eyebrow powder to lay down the basic shape, then I come back with Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade to finish filling in properly.  </li>
            <li> As long as you keep the stencil in the same spot (which honestly is super simple)</li>
            <li> A little more flimsy that expected</li>
            <li> These stencils are cut from thick plastic and are pretty sturdy; the various shapes available should be enough to please anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the shapes but was looking for something that was smaller, since it makes it hard to use them.</li>
            <li> Hold template of choice on brow and color in with a white eyeliner pencil to define the \\&quot;new brow\\&quot;position on your existing eyebrow.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STINCIL, HELPS ME KEEP MY BROW LINE STRAIGHT SINCE I AM UNABLE TO SEE WITHOUT MY GLASSES</li>
            <li> , you have to place it just right, then tape it down and hope it doesn&#x27;t move out of place.</li>
            <li> Had they fit they would have been at least a four.</li>
            <li> , there is like no in between so this kit is of no use to me personally because my eyebrows are no where near the size or shape of the stencils in this kit.</li>
            <li> I probably just need lots of practice with them, but will have to modify for plucking since they are much too wide.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be deceived; you can go directly to the ELF wesbite, and get thsi SAME set for $1!</li>
            <li> I would only suggest buying if you have larger than normal eyebrows..</li>
            <li> And most of them too thin.</li>
            <li> They are a thick material and are comfortable to place on your face, and are bendable.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s kind of silly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this the only thing is that I have a very small face and short eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Great for me, but a little weird also.</li>
            <li> The stencils are very helpful because it is hard for me to see up close with out glasses, so this helps me to keep my brow line straight...</li>
            <li> Once you have painted both brows with the white eyeliner pencil (You have to buy white pencil seperately) then pluck around the new drawn shape and wash white off.</li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful to not flex them too much while you hold them or they stretch open</li>
            <li> A must have if you have trouble starting your eyebrows or filling them in properly they&#x27;re thick enough but also flexible enough so you can get a good mold of your brow bone when you&#x27;re trying to fill the man</li>
            <li> I used to be so bad at doing my eyebrows, but now everyone says they are amazing!</li>
            <li> The stencils were all to long and none of them came close to the shape of my natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li> One good thing is they weren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea but very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> These stencils are a tad small, so I need to move them around when I do my brow to get the right shape.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have a natural arch shaped brow and these make your brows look really long with a short arch at the end</li>
            <li> Since my face is not flat, this is difficult to use, but it did give me a pattern to work on that was better than me using my imagination to try to figure out if both eyes looked the same or were the shape I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottom of the stencil hangs down into my eye so far that I can barely see</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the small stencil placed the arch in a very different place from the natural arch of my brow causing me to have to shift the stencil around a lot in order to get the whole brow filled in.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but I recommend using this on someone else or have someone else do it on you because it is a little hard to hold it up and fill in your eyebrows at the same time without it slipping because it is a rubbery material, and that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to grow some eyebrows that are less lopsided, so I don&#x27;t look permanently surprised with one eyebrow always showing above my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fathom them working on any women with an average size face shape, although if I let my five year old pluck her brows</li>
            <li> I did have to trim the plastic around the Eyebrow mold or whatever you want to call it because it did cover my eye lids and kinda poked me, But I have a small rounded face just something that I have to deal with once in awhile, but again it wasn&#x27;t any real issue with the product itself</li>
            <li> Placing the guide properly and holding it to the face is rather strange.</li>
            <li> The set features several shapes that you can choose from and while some can be too long, you&#x27;re bound to find something that fits.</li>
            <li> Too big and long for my face.</li>
            <li> If your eyebrows do not naturally have a definite arch.</li>
            <li> If your eyebrows do not naturally have a definite arch.</li>
            <li> They are not bad, they are not great.</li>
            <li> The same line will look different on one side of my face than the other, but the stencil gives me the peace of mind that the lines are the same, and it&#x27;s my face</li>
            <li> These are  difficult to use and they are easily lost.</li>
            <li> The only problem was its very bendable and not that thick.</li>
            <li> There are thin, medium &amp; thick stencils so anyone can find the stencil that closely matches their own eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Not like other stencil kits that only have one stencil, every person doesn&#x27;t have the same eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I only gave them four stars because I found other  companies that offer a larger selection along with helpful tips/links.</li>
            <li> I could have done a better job tracing eyebrows on paper and cutting out along the lines .</li>
            <li> These stencils are so difficult to use, and seem really cheap.</li>
            <li> place the stencil using my natural brows as a guideline, and simply stencil them in using brown eyeshadow on a small makeup brush.</li>
            <li> They are also too long</li>
            <li> They are way too big and not very practical .</li>
            <li> all the stencils are for ladies with bigger brows - not much for thinner brows..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but only because I have just started using stencils.</li>
            <li> Product is too soft and not easy to work with...</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the stencils work for me, but that&#x27;s what I expected!</li>
            <li> This is a template kit and has no color or the other questions asked above.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small face and very sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The only thing which I would change would be the packaging, it&#x27;s more complicated than it had to be since there was around 3-6 other small pieces of paper that were not necessary</li>
            <li> I like these very much, I always have the problem of over plucking one eyebrow and trying to get the other to match and always end up doing to much and looking a bit crazy.</li>
            <li> They assume women all have the same eyebrow shape, so they were all completely round and similar in shape.</li>
            <li> one placed the arch directly in the center of my brow like an upside down \\&quot;V\\&quot;, while the other made me have \\&quot;apostrophe\\&quot; brows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a single problem with the shipping.</li>
            <li> Every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little hard to use at first</li>
            <li> But I would definitely recommend them to somebody who does other peoples make up!</li>
            <li> If one does not have a steady grip (or have a shaky hand), you may not want to purchase this either.</li>
            <li> If one does not have a steady grip (or have a shaky hand), you may not want to purchase this either.</li>
            <li> The material of this stencil is very soft and sticky, and hard to control&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful to do this job</li>
            <li> The fact that the stencils were to think and not long enough sucks.</li>
            <li> very awkward to hold and To make sure both sides are even and to try to color At the same</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit thinner than the front bigger part</li>
            <li> The shape of the stencels is a little smaller that I had imagined.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold in place and make it look natural.</li>
            <li> There is only one downfall to them and its that when your filling your eyebrows in they are hard to hold at the same time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, when the e.l.f stencil kit arrived I gave it a try right away and was disappointed to find that there were only 2 small and 2 large stencils in this kit</li>
            <li> helped me get a rough shape</li>
            <li> ,it make it harder to use.</li>
            <li> These are not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using pencils and brush for my eyebrows and got curious on this,</li>
            <li> I wear my eyebrows the same everyday</li>
            <li> I traced them on paper and there is not much difference.</li>
            <li> so it is harder for me to use these.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be careful to hold in place on both sides and check for eveness before you start.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these for stenciling eyebrows on while doing drag.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really any point to it</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t align them according to the instructions because they are too wide.</li>
            <li> what a pity..</li>
            <li> I do not really have the time and money to go to the salon to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, but wish it worked for &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; brows</li>
            <li> I used it to shape my eyebrows and because of how big and thick they were, I found that i could actually use all of the shapes in this stencil.</li>
            <li> Only 1 of the stencils will likely work for you since everyone&#x27;s shape and needs are different...unless you&#x27;re blessed w/ thick brows that you can do a lot w/.</li>
            <li> Even the thinest of these was too thick for an old lady&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I had never bothered much with my eyebrows other than randomly plucking at the messy bits - as far as what shape to do them in, I had no clue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY hard to see what you are doing, it covers your whole eye, it works a little but absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is they are too big for me, I am very small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old female, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was a common issue</li>
            <li> Its hard to hold and color at the same time, plus my shape looks odd , i couldnt find a similar one</li>
            <li> Way to big for my face, they were made for thick and long eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I find the arch is too high and brow sizes too thin at ends</li>
            <li> The first one I tried gave me shapely, angry Joan Crawford brows.</li>
            <li> This was pretty useless and fell apart, quite literally.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother looking for other stencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are too big for my small face.</li>
            <li> the other 3 you can give to your friends, mother ..</li>
            <li> but I think they would work wonders for other people.</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks about this product is that they don&#x27;t stick to your face, which wasn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> Personally, it&#x27;s too thin and short though.</li>
            <li> I also find the shapes to be natural and not too dramatic like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> They are a bit big but not too hard to hold and apply the powder.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using the stencils to fill in my whole brow</li>
            <li> 5 dollar is NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but for a beginner I would really recommend these.</li>
            <li> At least it was only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price AND the shipping....</li>
            <li> NOT worth what i paid</li>
            <li> Not worth it .</li>
            <li> , I just feel my eyebrows will look much too fake if I follow the stencils they provided in this set.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was getting SO fed up with my brows and how slowly they were growing back.</li>
            <li> I love it, I hate waxing my eye brow</li>
            <li> The one stencil that actually matches my eyebrow shape is WAY too thick.</li>
            <li> Thick plastic, will last forever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t for my brows at all, thrown away after a few tries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only for people who want thick man brows.</li>
            <li> This suckes I mean there is only 4 papers and they are saying it is a brow stencil kit</li>
            <li> but it is extremely helpful!</li>
            <li> Now the other transvestites will stop teasing me!</li>
            <li> I recommend it extremely!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I feel the tail end of the eyebrow is a little too thick.</li>
            <li> Previously, I just penciled in my brows, but was never even.  </li>
            <li> on a less fussy girl</li>
            <li> I put a 4, because not very easy to hold the stencil, he drives off and then need to paint an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I have the most pathetic eyebrow and it looks like the only one (or two) I could use is the smallest one(s), but they do the job.</li>
            <li> These little plastic strips are not worth fifty cents.  </li>
            <li> If you really have trouble with eyebrows this could help little difficult to draw while holding plastic I. Place</li>
            <li> stupid stencils are either to big or too small, they are not made for your face, they can slide around, and you end up with big, often crooked, SUPER fake looking eyebrows on your face.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t make a mess on your face.</li>
            <li> they do not have adhesive they leave no sticky mess on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> they were WAY to thick and the length of them wasn&#x27;t that long, i recommend buying somewhere else.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t long and they aren&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use  and their stencils are not the right size for my very small brows.</li>
            <li> The stencils are as thick as a credit card, barely flexible and hard to maneuver while trying to \\&quot;do your brows\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Product came with half the items missing from box.</li>
            <li> You need to practice a little</li>
            <li> but this kit helped me a little to fix.</li>
            <li> so it took a little finessing</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use if you&#x27;re a beginner</li>
            <li> LITTLE BRUSHES AND INSTRUCTIONS ON</li>
            <li> I also found that when pressed against your brow, it sticks a little bit which makes the stencil easier to use.</li>
            <li> so I just wanted to make them a little fuller</li>
            <li> I on the other hand have messed up eyebrows because I am lazy and shave my brows instead of taking the time to pluck them.</li>
            <li> It can be a little slippery, but I had it for a day and got a handle of it in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It can be a little slippery, but I had it for a day and got a handle of it in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just a bit messy but do the job.</li>
            <li> REALLY A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use any of them at all, waste of money</li>
            <li> I never have shaped my eyebrows, I always considered them rather round</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these Stencils however, my brows are too short and thin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought would, waste of time.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> WASTE FI&#x3D;&#x3D;OF</li>
            <li> they definantly do help but the plastic is flimsy and even tho its a stencil, eyebrows still come out uneven sometimes</li>
            <li> mom told me that she had trouble putting on eyebrows everyday and that it took her up to an hour every time</li>
            <li> Just a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all and felt I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Either they were too thin, too arched and or too short.</li>
            <li> could not use them jus a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Again not a great big deal its paper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them everyday since they got here and Utube has a video on how to use them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish i wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit a few months ago and never got around to writing a review.</li>
            <li> I prefer one over the others but I like having the option to pick from a few &amp;#34;styles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it was a waste .</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> Please save yourself the trouble by not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Please save yourself the trouble by not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> my brows are drawn on, then I pluck or shave the hairs that aren&#x27;t in the colored area and wash off the brow powder because I look weird when my eyebrows are noticeable, since usually  people who are in denial about needing to wear glasses, or people who need a new corrective eye lens prescription are like &amp;#34;Omg, you, like, have, like no eyebrows, like... like&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I looked in the mirror I was taken back at how ridiculous it looked, they looked like clown eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I always found it difficult to fill my eyebrows same to each other.</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows are pretty ugly and uneven.</li>
            <li> This was not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to adjust the shape to compliment your facial structure (e.g: by extending the tail or shortening the line if it is too long).</li>
            <li> I use Elf less often  than I would like ( in my area its kinda hard to find</li>
            <li> I was a little paranoid about buying some stencils I have never used but after trying these I cannot complain!</li>
            <li> Not a very good product, I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to hold while tracing or applying eyebrow makeup, but they do their job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its cut a bit edgy but It does help a little bit.</li>
            <li> so instead I used small square of tape to stick it to my face, trace the outline, and fill in the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else struggles with this</li>
            <li> I do like e.l.f. products, but I&#x27;m not sure if I like this or not.  </li>
            <li> The stencils are difficult to hold up and don&#x27;t line up across my entire brow</li>
            <li> I have a small face</li>
            <li> or maybe I have an abnormally small head..</li>
            <li> They arrived within a few days of purchase, too, so that&#x27;s always a bonus!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on these unless you have thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> I was not sure where to start the process of taming my caterpillars until these stencils helped out.</li>
            <li> i am not pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> The stencils fitted perfectly on my small sized face.</li>
            <li> These are way too big and are completely useless.</li>
            <li> They are way too small....</li>
            <li> These may work for women with petite brows, but they are way too small for me.  </li>
            <li> small applause*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult to place properly.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and overdone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at that.  </li>
            <li> Each size was WAY to small for my eyebrows , and my eyebrows arent even that thick .</li>
            <li> These stencils are so hard to use.</li>
            <li> I seemed to have a hard time with these</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t work well at all and are hard to use to get any sort of shape.</li>
            <li> The stencils are flimsy and hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just hard to use and keep moving all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Just press it hard against the skin and brush powder across it once.</li>
            <li> it was too hard to hold stencil in place and then fill in with the pencil or brush.</li>
            <li> hard to hold the stencil in place while trying to apply brow color - maybe it takes practice and patience</li>
            <li> Wish these had a sticky to go with them to keep them in place, it&#x27;s rather hard to maneuver them while trying to stencil in the brow color.</li>
            <li> these are really hard to use in either form.</li>
            <li> to fill your eyebrows in, the plastic moves all the time and its hard to get it even.</li>
            <li> to pluck, its still hard to fill the brows in in order to pluck around.</li>
            <li> This was too hard to keep placed in the eyebrow area for me.  </li>
            <li> shaping is still a hard thing for me now ..</li>
            <li> I did a hard time in the beginning trying to find which eyebrow arch belongs to what stencil because the name wasn&#x27;t labeled on the stencil.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard or frustrating because you have too get them even and</li>
            <li> I find it awkward holding the stencil down with one hand and filling in my brow with the other.</li>
            <li> The plastic does not stick to your face and you end up with a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> so i couldnt look at what i was doing, I tried cutting it shorter but the thick plastic still made it hard to open my eye and it poked at my skin.</li>
            <li> I was unable to hold the stencil and fill in my brows because the stencil keeps slipping.</li>
            <li> These stencils are so damn tiny, I wanted to use these to shape my brows but these are so thin they are useless.</li>
            <li> Such a hassle and disappointment.</li>
            <li> The one adjustment I did make however, was the stencil was wide so that my viewing while tracing was a bit obstructed, I merely used my scissors and trimmed off of the bottom of the stencil</li>
            <li> I use at least once a day</li>
            <li> It will take practice though, at least for me.</li>
            <li> but I think it sucks.</li>
            <li> Not a great buy had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> but my eyebrows are quite thick</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are way too thick in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use them as a base, but even that is to much.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re never as thick as I want them to be but this stencil kit proved otherwise.</li>
            <li> They can be a bit thick</li>
            <li> These are plastic stencils for thinning, thick, or unmanageable eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The shape that worked for my brows was too thick.</li>
            <li> I have use other stencil kits with not a drop of drama that these were, would not recommend sorry.</li>
            <li> Create cartoon eyebrows that are way to big for anyone&#x27;s face, and look silly doing it!</li>
            <li> but it still looks ridiculous thick as a stencil.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to align both sides to look the same.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to hold in place and have the ability to hold the eyebrow powder brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have a small face and thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> but they are way too thin and small</li>
            <li> Way too big for my face &amp; it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold one up while you put pencil on.</li>
            <li> I have very thin half eyebrows because of thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li> , the application was a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> I have to use magnification to color my brows and that is a little difficult when I have to hold the stencil</li>
            <li> This stencils are useless they are so small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Bad idea, i do not know how to use these properly as they dont come with instructions and now they sit in the bottom of my makeup bag never to be used again.</li>
            <li> I have brows that are so blond that they cannot be seen, and it&#x27;s difficult to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; my brows on as some hair is missing as well.</li>
            <li> These are the reason you see women with big bulky ugly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have tried twice and failed so this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that boy, does this plastic make the skin underneath it sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up; times are hard!</li>
            <li> You can hardly feel it on your brow!</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I used to hate having thick, bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that they were not smaller.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know there were reusable, thick, flexible, plastic stencils, and paper ones!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very hard to hold with one hand and then stencil on the brow powder or eye shadow onto the stencil.</li>
            <li> i like that they are very thick.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are really thin.  </li>
            <li> Really poor product.</li>
            <li> Sizes are too thin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like thin brows</li>
            <li> but you can get around that using a smudge tool and drawing the line thin and then smudge to the thickness you want.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows from over-plucking</li>
            <li> I have thin brows and have to fill them in each morning.</li>
            <li> The designs are too thin for my liking.</li>
            <li> Horrified to realize my brows were too thin.</li>
            <li> but it drives ME crazy when they are uneven!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to hate a product, because I think it could be useful to others.</li>
            <li> Unless you are extremely patient, you will be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Once you choose the stencil to use, they are flimsy, awkward and clumsy to work with.  </li>
            <li> By far this is the worst product I ever used....</li>
            <li> save your money and go to a salon everyday if you have to!!!!</li>
            <li> I try to do it, it looks so weird.</li>
            <li> The stencils were difficult to place for eyebrow powder use.</li>
            <li> everything else is just wrong.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, these are silly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on these, unless you want to look stupid.</li>
            <li> I find it a useless item.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to hold up to your eye and use.</li>
            <li> it quite difficult to work with</li>
            <li> .. WEIRD</li>
            <li> cause she would just look silly.</li>
            <li> However, I find it difficult to hold the stencil in place while applying eyebrow makeup.</li>
            <li> cheep stencil and largely exaggerated.</li>
            <li> It may be something I try again in winter, but trying to paint these puppies on in mid-day is an uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they will be going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> and every time it is too difficult.</li>
            <li> Elf Eyebrow stencils look useless .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless and not practical.</li>
            <li> They are helpful , a like difficult to use, but shouldnt b sold for 4.99, in Target</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Holding it to your eye is difficult</li>
            <li> Unless I wanted eyebrows the size of caterpillars, these are useless.</li>
            <li> I actually thought they would be hilariously awful, but they do have some selling points.</li>
            <li> If you have VERY little eyebrow like me these are worthless.</li>
            <li> Weird shapes, weird sizes, bad material.</li>
            <li> They have been durable and although they get a bit dirty they can be wipe or washed off.  </li>
            <li> they are awkward when putting on.  </li>
            <li> Applying this product is both  and exasperating and awkward.</li>
            <li> My brows came out worst than when I used just my plain ole&#x27; pencils.  </li>
            <li> Fail proof!</li>
            <li> I find this product very difficult to use -</li>
            <li> these are nearly impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> All bad ladies.</li>
            <li> bad bad job of it too.</li>
            <li> This thing sucked so bad...</li>
            <li> its too painful, so I would shape them.</li>
            <li> Once I got them and held it up for comparison I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stencil Use: (My intended use for the stencils was to shape and define my eyebrows for tweezing)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly Did not meet my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> Stupid of me to think this would work.</li>
            <li> stupid me.....</li>
            <li> Worthless product.</li>
            <li> I hate them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> These brow stencills are awful they look like a bad brow job. :(</li>
            <li> I actually hated washing it off my face at bed time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a horrible purchase but not for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great idea!! I love it already and just got it yesterday</li>
            <li> FAST delivery. I&#x27;ve always liked E.L.F. products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Way too big for my face &amp; it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold one up while you put pencil on.</li>
            <li> Purchased item to help shape brows.  Once I received the item I realized it was use to draw brows where there weren&#x27;t any.</li>
            <li> Only order this if you have 3 hands...enough said.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using the stencils to fill in my whole brow so I just use the top line to shape the brow and fill in the rest free hand.</li>
            <li> These are stencils - There is no color to apply as the review survey intimates.  They are ok.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product. It was ok.  I preferred and found I liked just drawing my own. My eyebrows are really thin.  The template didn&#x27;t go that skinny.</li>
            <li> These are ok not very easy to use but they do work. Just a bit messy but do the job.</li>
            <li> REALLY A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> This stencil set is amazing! It comes with 4 stencils with different shapes: soft arch, structured arch, curved arch, and full arch! I was looking for set that would be easy to use and that would save me some $ from getting my eyebrows done at the salon! Definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in diy eyebrows and looking to save some money!</li>
            <li> This helps my morning make-up routine go by faster and it works as it should, my only gripe is I think the stencils are very large and I always find myself make them smaller.</li>
            <li> It was amazing. I have a scar on my right eyebrow that I got as a kid (playing with a cousin, 4 stitches!) so my eyebrows are pretty ugly and uneven. With this simple supply, I can make them look even and the filling is very easy. I just loved them!</li>
            <li> These stencils are a tad small, so I need to move them around when I do my brow to get the right shape.</li>
            <li> Love this. Only 2 of the stencils work for me, but that&#x27;s what I expected! I hold the stencil on and fill in with my Anastasia Brow product. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Nice price with nice product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to use these. It would&#x27;ve been better if it came with instructions or tips.&lt;br /&gt;When I try to do it, it looks so weird. If I could figure it out, then it&#x27;d be an awesome item.</li>
            <li> Bought these awhile back.. They are really cheap, so if you&#x27;re interested than I guess you can go grab them, but I would not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;The stencils are nice shapes, but don&#x27;t really help you achieve that exact shape. I used all of the stencils they offer and it&#x27;s literally not going to match the stencil shape. It&#x27;s practically a waste of time and money, but again, it is cheap, like.. $1 so if you are having the urge to try, why not I guess.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but maybe if it actually had some sticky-ness to it, would it really work.</li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of shapes. Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are  difficult to use and they are easily lost. These little plastic strips are not worth fifty cents.  I kep trying to use them, but I am wasting my time.</li>
            <li> Really like it if it will stick</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know there were reusable, thick, flexible, plastic stencils, and paper ones! Nice surprise!</li>
            <li> All stencils are rounded. Some ladies liked squared eyebrows. Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to keep the stencil in one place while I used it, but someone with better eye makeup skills or a steadier hand would probably have more luck.</li>
            <li> The stencils were difficult to place for eyebrow powder use.</li>
            <li> Of the five plastic shapes, only one shape actually applied to me. I&#x27;d love to see a couple wider and (especially) more natural arches. THANKS!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow stencil set comes with 4 different re-usable eyebrow stencil shapes, I think it is easy to use and saves you going to get your eyebrows plucked at a salon, however if you haven&#x27;t got a steady hand like me I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, as it does involve patience and focus, I love it though :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they would be perfectly shaped for filling in my brows, and they are the right shape... everything else is just wrong. Brushes and filling pencils slide easily under the plastic form which results in a mess and having to wash your face A LOT and start over. Getting your brows even is a challenge. I can achieve my look better freehand than I can with these.</li>
            <li> cheap and not very user friendly</li>
            <li> These are amazing. They match my eyebrows and they&#x27;re realisic shapes</li>
            <li> Did a trial run today after I got these and I cannot tell you how pleased I am! I was &amp;#34;free handing&amp;#34; my brows every morning and it was taking forever! I stumbled across these looking at brow powder...... While they do look too large at first, when you &amp;#34;trace&amp;#34; inside the stencil, they will automatically not be as large as they look. Highly recommend. Great for grooming your brows too if you don&#x27;t need them for thin sparse brows!</li>
            <li> I have a petite face and blonde eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to just let them be because it&#x27;s not like anyone can see them, but in sunlight AHH THERE&#x27;S A SHINY PAIR OF WOOKIES ON YOUR FACE!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use these to draw a line with eyebrow powder using the bottom of one of the stencils that compliments my bones and face the best. Then I fill in the top of the line freehand to make nice eyebrows on both sides, just having the line to start saves me hours of drawing, erasing, redrawing, ect because NO ONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL FACE!!! The same line will look different on one side of my face than the other, but the stencil gives me the peace of mind that the lines are the same, and it&#x27;s my face that&#x27;s ****ed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my brows are drawn on, then I pluck or shave the hairs that aren&#x27;t in the colored area and wash off the brow powder because I look weird when my eyebrows are noticeable, since usually  people who are in denial about needing to wear glasses, or people who need a new corrective eye lens prescription are like &amp;#34;Omg, you, like, have, like no eyebrows, like... like&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No they&#x27;re just blonde, whatever. But somehow may face looks better with shaped eyebrows than unshaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ELF, you saved me years of practice, care, and worry, by giving me a line. I never imagined how much time a line would save me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> How can you hold this to your face AND fill in your brows at the same time?  I haven&#x27;t mastered it so I don&#x27;t use them.  The stencils come in different shapes but I find it easier to fill my brows without the guides.</li>
            <li> It’s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks about this product is that they don&#x27;t stick to your face, which wasn&#x27;t expected. I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup so instead I used small square of tape to stick it to my face, trace the outline, and fill in the rest. I used these stencils about two times because I learned how to shape my eyebrows on my own! These are a great teacher and I&#x27;d recommend them for anyone who&#x27;s trying to figure out what shape looks best on their face.</li>
            <li> This suckes I mean there is only 4 papers and they are saying it is a brow stencil kit..? I GOT THEM TODAY.DONT EVER GET THIS EVER!This product is horroble! 5 dollar is NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I have always had less than perfect eyebrows and was hoping this stencil kit would solve my problem by incorporating it into my daily makeup routine. My eyebrows are for the most part full but have like no arch therefore they lack shape (and yes I have tried plucking and waxing many times) needless to say it is hard to make them look good. Most of the time I am tempted to just shave them off and get them tattooed on but let&#x27;s not go there because with my luck it will look like someone drew them on with a sharpie lol. Anyway, when the e.l.f stencil kit arrived I gave it a try right away and was disappointed to find that there were only 2 small and 2 large stencils in this kit, there is like no in between so this kit is of no use to me personally because my eyebrows are no where near the size or shape of the stencils in this kit. Forget about even talking about the eyebrow application itself. The stencils are as thick as a credit card, barely flexible and hard to maneuver while trying to \\&quot;do your brows\\&quot;. If you are able to pull off an anime face or celebrity look because you have no eyebrows and paint them on then go for it I&#x27;m sure these will give you beautiful results but these stencils just don&#x27;t work well for most average women, with average sized faced which have natural eyebrows and normal sized foreheads.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was getting SO fed up with my brows and how slowly they were growing back. Now they&#x27;re fine and I don&#x27;t need these anymore, but at the time I just figured that I had nothing to lose since they were so inexpensive and I was willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve had problems with over plucking and just now managed to get them to grow fully back after 4 months of really trying. When I bought these stencils, I had no idea what else to do because my brows were at completely different shapes while growing them and I was BEYOND frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for only one of the stencils that looked pretty close to my ideal brow shape, and the one I felt like I could most easily pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got these, I was SO excited only to see that they&#x27;re kind of flimsy and pretty freaking hard to use. But, once I figured out how to both hold them up to my face and use a brush/pencil to fill in the shape at the same time, I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product but I figured I&#x27;d keep using them for a while until I grew my brows out to the point where I didn&#x27;t need them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They helped me get a rough shape so they were somewhat symmetrical and then I would blend, fill, blend, fill, repeat until I was happy with them, or until I had to literally run out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Good price&lt;br /&gt;-Helps get a rough shape, probably better if you barely have brows at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Flimsy&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to use</li>
            <li> I like that the stencil will let u get a nice shaped eyebrow but i don&#x27;t like the materal it&#x27;s made from,it make it harder to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STINCIL, HELPS ME KEEP MY BROW LINE STRAIGHT SINCE I AM UNABLE TO SEE WITHOUT MY GLASSES ON</li>
            <li> I have very thin half eyebrows because of thyroid issues.  These are great to have to give you a good base shape for your brows when drawing them on.  I put stencil in place and use a very light eyebrow powder to lay down the basic shape, then I come back with Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade to finish filling in properly.  Easy eyebrows, even and perfectly shaped every time.</li>
            <li> Nice shapes on good material. Easy to keep in place.</li>
            <li> Not a great buy had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> this worked relatively well for me, as I was an avid over-plucker when left to my own devices.  The stencils are a little long for my eyebrows, but the plastic they&#x27;e made from is durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If i could give a 0 star for this product i would. First of all the I noticed that the stencils do not have a line in the middle to help guide the shading unlike the sephora stencil. Unfortunetly sephora doesnt sell their eybrow stencils anymore though. Second as soon as i put the stencil on my eye it covered my eye so i couldnt look at what i was doing, I tried cutting it shorter but the thick plastic still made it hard to open my eye and it poked at my skin. and when i shaded in my eyebrow powder my eyebrows came out with extremely thick shading even though i had made sure that the stencil was on my skin. Basically I would NEVER recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Stencils are too short! Eyebrows shouldn&#x27;t be that short! And most of them too thin. Couldn&#x27;t use any of them at all, waste of money</li>
            <li> Now I just need to grow some eyebrows that are less lopsided, so I don&#x27;t look permanently surprised with one eyebrow always showing above my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend.Super flexible and models are good too, but recommend. Tenhos other stencils but are not that good and better than ever met.</li>
            <li> So, I was pretty excited about this product. I have nice, fuller brows but I am constantly stuggling to make them both the same shape. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else struggles with this but it drives ME crazy when they are uneven! Unfortuently, this product was not the solution. The kit comes with four stencils: two \\&quot;small\\&quot; and two for \\&quot;large\\&quot;. Well, the two smaller stencils were a joke...I couldn&#x27;t fathom them working on any women with an average size face shape, although if I let my five year old pluck her brows (umm no!!) they might work for her. The two larger stencils also didn&#x27;t work: one placed the arch directly in the center of my brow like an upside down \\&quot;V\\&quot;, while the other made me have \\&quot;apostrophe\\&quot; brows. All bad ladies. Save yourself some time and money and skip this product.</li>
            <li> You need to practice a little but it is extremely helpful!</li>
            <li> well this kit is good and easy to use,u can bring anywhere u go just drop it inside your beautybag and u can use anytime u want. though to be honest i know already to do my own eyebrows but this kit helped me a little to fix. if u are beginners and want to have your own technique to learn u should try to use this.the price is cheap and every women out there for sure can afford it.(wink)</li>
            <li> I like the shapes and they are very easy to clean but I don&#x27;t think anyones eyebrows is as big, width or length as these stencils therefore I don&#x27;t ever use them. I would only suggest buying if you have larger than normal eyebrows..</li>
            <li> These stencils are iffy. They are not bad, they are not great. If my budget wasn&#x27;t so tight, I would be complaining a bit more. I never have shaped my eyebrows, I always considered them rather round and that was that. I wanted more of an arch, but wasn&#x27;t confident enough to free-hand tweeze so I bought these. According to these stencils, I have an arch. Great for me, but a little weird also. They are pretty sturdy to me, work well enough. They are a little hard to hold while tracing or applying eyebrow makeup, but they do their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for beginners.</li>
            <li> These are not what I expected.  If you have ANY issues with your hands or shoulders these are nearly impossible to use.  If you have VERY little eyebrow like me these are worthless.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product and seller to all who are trying to get those model eyebrows.  These stencils are small enough to carry in your purse and easy to clean and care for.  Try this product you will like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> As I age, I notice that my eyebrows are getting more sparse and look lighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these stencils for weeks now and just love them!&lt;br /&gt;All of the stencils work well for me, and they are so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I place the stencil using my natural brows as a guideline, and simply stencil them in using brown eyeshadow on a small makeup brush. I just brush on the color while holding the stencil still over my brow.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I get one a bit off kilter, but have always been able to fix ithem easily, by manipulating the way I hold it, or using a q-tip to clean up around the edges a bit.&lt;br /&gt;These stencils give a very nice, natural look and make it seem as if I actually know what I am doing!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these Stencils however, my brows are too short and thin. (And I always thought I had pretty full brows!) I probably just need lots of practice with them, but will have to modify for plucking since they are much too wide. If I could find a better fit I would trade these in.</li>
            <li> Because I think the plasti is too flimsy . My mom used something like this in the 60&#x27;s and I was hoping these would be the se as hers . But they r not! They work but too flimsy for me!</li>
            <li> I using this with the Wonder brow product. I have sparce brow hairs and the stencils give me a defined area to work in.</li>
            <li> I was unable to hold the stencil and fill in my brows because the stencil keeps slipping. Really poor product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought would, waste of time.</li>
            <li> I do like e.l.f. products, but I&#x27;m not sure if I like this or not.  This might be good for people with huge bushy eyebrows, but mine are a lot thinner than the stencils. They also seem very large. They might be good to use if you can place them with some tape and fill in the stencil with some eyebrow powder just to how they look being a lot bigger and larger.Gonna try that and see what happens, then I&#x27;ll be able to give a better review of how they work. One good thing is they weren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and you have to cut the edges to fit</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to help do my eyebrows but never did use them.  I was trying to get a better arch.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Love all elf stuff :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these stencils at first. They worked great with all kinds of brow powders - a thicker brush gets the job done quickly. I have brows that are so blond that they cannot be seen, and it&#x27;s difficult to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; my brows on as some hair is missing as well. This made them look full and manicured. I saw a photo of myself and realized that it really didn&#x27;t look so great on me - I probably just picked the wrong stencil, and made it too dark. Once you find the right one, it&#x27;s just a huge time saver.</li>
            <li> Great price. Wish stencils were made of more durable and firmer plastic. Feels like plastic covers on sofas tht my grandma had on her sofas.</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t work as great as I thought.</li>
            <li> Very happy with thisn purchase. Straightforward with a variety of brow shapes to use!</li>
            <li> The stencils are difficult to hold up and don&#x27;t line up across my entire brow so I have to do it in two stages then make sure the two connect.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to figure them out</li>
            <li> Really didnt help do not reccomend</li>
            <li> Sizes are too thin. I got these to try to help shape my eyebrows into a thicker shape and they were way thinner than what I originally have. Gave this kit away.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, simple to use, practical, and convenient because of the size. Time of deliver was quick actually!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  The only problem is they are too big for me, I am very small.  I gave to a friend and she loves them!  I love the product I just wish they would make another in a smaller size so I can use them too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product is as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works really well, hold up, is strong and not flimsy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in 2 ways. 1) I place it over my brows and use white liner to draw an outline and then pluck anything outside of the white line to keep the shape growing that moving forward. 2) I then place it over my brow when doing my make-up and use brow shadow/pencil to define the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy, and affective. I also find the shapes to be natural and not too dramatic like a drag queen. I have a small face and I found the length to be perfect as well. For the price this is a steal and well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and was a nice price. Easier to use from what I thought it would be  I do like the brand and it is one that I would buy again</li>
            <li> The easiest stencil to follow! I love that the pack is a variety of different shapes instead of job at one or two. It&#x27;s really easy to follow I normally shade in the stencil and wax or shave the part that wasn&#x27;t shaded. It&#x27;s helped so much especially with saving from not paying someone to wax my eyebrows anymore. Elf products are normally great value anyway so this wasn&#x27;t a suprise that it works so good for me. I was very happy to get this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I bought this in reduced cost. Ive been using pencils and brush for my eyebrows and got curious on this, So because of curiosity i bought it.  When i tried it, im having hard time in using it and Its so hard to select the best stencil for me at first. So i research on youtube how to used it. The only problem was its very bendable and not that thick.</li>
            <li> Loved the variety and they&#x27;re doing me really good so far. :)</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty using this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was before the estimated time. I liked it because it fit me perfectly. I always found it difficult to fill my eyebrows same to each other. Now it&#x27;s pretty easy</li>
            <li> I love the different shapes on the stencils.  I have tried all the shapes and they are very normal size. A lot of stencils are insanely big so they don&#x27;t fit your face. These are much more realistic. They are a nice plastic that bends easily to the contours of your face but is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t lose shape.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It was a waste of money. When I try to use it I couldn&#x27;t get it to look right.</li>
            <li> I misunderstood the product description I thought it would contain the eyebrow powder not just the stencil.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  It is durable and can be used many times. It is useful for people whose eyebrows are not clearly defined.</li>
            <li> These have been helpful in getting a more identical shape but I have had to adjust and add to get the right shape for me.  They have been durable and although they get a bit dirty they can be wipe or washed off.  Affordable and a useful tool for my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, these are silly.  they are awkward when putting on.  better do it freehand.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast .. got it in 3 business days...I tried it the very night i got it and I was elated. However, please keep in mind that if you are not patient this is not the product for you .. it takes some time n effort to get the hang of it. additionally they don&#x27;t really stay in place as much as i would like BUT i fixed that problem by damping the stencil before i put it in place.. N water really works magic .. when it is damp it stick right on my skin and stays it place. despite the problem of it not staying in place and the effort it took to learn how to use it i do believe it is a great product and so it deserves 5 stars.. plus the service was wonderful</li>
            <li> These stencils are so hard to use. I would recommend creating your own stencils that will fit your face and shape.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a lot easier. I find it awkward holding the stencil down with one hand and filling in my brow with the other. If you use powder eyebrow color it doesn&#x27;t really fill in well. I may try using it again with a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Two of them are the prefect shape</li>
            <li> WASTE FI&#x3D;&#x3D;OF MY MONEY&#x3D;WOUD COST ME MORE TO RETURN IT THAN IT COST!</li>
            <li> Horrible! It&#x27;s just paper.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as cool as I thought. Didn&#x27;t likethe outlines they didn&#x27;t really look good. Wasn&#x27;t a horrible purchase but not for me.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get use to using but once you get the hang of it , it works well, and I love them!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to give this product 5 stars because it does work, quite well infact, and was cheap.  That said, you have to be talented enough to hold the stencils so that your application is symetrical.  I&#x27;m not very good at that.  Most of the brows were too large for my face, but that&#x27;s why they give you a variety.  Just wish I had 3 hands....</li>
            <li> All of the stencils were way too big for me. I&#x27;m a 21 year old female, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was a common issue or maybe I have an abnormally small head..</li>
            <li> Not a very good product, I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty cool, they are pretty easy to use. I wear my eyebrows the same everyday so I don&#x27;t really get to much use out of them. But I would definitely recommend them to somebody who does other peoples make up!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and looks good once applied I actually hated washing it off my face at bed time.</li>
            <li> they definantly do help but the plastic is flimsy and even tho its a stencil, eyebrows still come out uneven sometimes</li>
            <li> I receive my delivery in an acceptable amount of time. When I open the package I saw that the stencils were the kind of material that maybe a sturdy cardboard maybe made of. 2 of the samples obviously not for my face shape but two of them actually looks really nice. This product is not as easy to use as I thought but after some time I did get the desired result. So I would suggest this to a friend but only if I knew that person was patient enough to take the time to master this. I can tell that 2 or 3 more times using this I should be a pro. Will update after those two or three times.</li>
            <li> best stencil for eye brows i&#x27;ve found! Just still havent figured out how to keep them on while i try to stencil them on</li>
            <li> I saw this on the elf site and wanted it, but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the almost ten dollars in shipping for a dollar product. Target sells elf products, but not the stencil. I looked it up online and found this seller, and caught it at a time when I saved more than half of what I would&#x27;ve paid the manufacturers. I know some people who use stencils to fill in their brows, but I purchased this to shape mine. I hold the stencil over my brow (I overlap it because my brow shape is a bit thicker than the stencil) and use a white eyeliner pencil I bought separately to fill them in, then plucked the hairs outside of the desired shape. They arrived within a few days of purchase, too, so that&#x27;s always a bonus!</li>
            <li> This eye brow stencil kit is amazing it helps shape or fill in your eyebrows. There is only one downfall to them and its that when your filling your eyebrows in they are hard to hold at the same time. Other than that they are perfect and would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking eyebrows</li>
            <li> Great shapes, very easy to apply, and in a cute envelope.</li>
            <li> I like the different shapes this kit contains, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> These stencils are so damn tiny, I wanted to use these to shape my brows but these are so thin they are useless. I can&#x27;t return!!</li>
            <li> It was okay. The stencils are kind of big but that wasn&#x27;t really a big problem for me because I have fairy medium to think brows. Also the stencils tend to stick together.</li>
            <li> With this, you must buy some kind of powder to accompany it.  This was not easy to use.  The plastic does not stick to your face and you end up with a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> After over tweezing for years my eyebrows will not grow back.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my eyebrows look natural, (like my old eyebrows -  RIP..sniff sniff)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this products again and from this person because it was delivered quickly and with an unexpected gift!</li>
            <li> No. These are the reason you see women with big bulky ugly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy and definitely worth the price. With four different stencils to choose from, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i just got this in the mail today and immediately tried it when i got home and i really like this! i always get my eyebrows done and never knew how to do them myself but the stencils were easy to use and for a first timer in doing eyebrows myself i give this product a A+ i didn&#x27;t use the paper stencils that came with it i used the clear ones. Overall, if needed i will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> If you have a longer and wider brow line, this would be good for you. However I find that my head is no where near the size needed to make my brows look a reasonable size by utilizing this product. If you want to use this as means for a guide as in using the bottom or top, just a little at first, that would be best. Goodbye Elf, I wish you would have worked for me!</li>
            <li> Its cut a bit edgy but It does help a little bit. Might be better for someone else. I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star cause of how they are cut out and the fact you can just buy it at walmart for cheaper, So there&#x27;s that. Check your local walmart before ordering it on here is all i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I wish the stencils came with thinner brow shapes. I only use one of the shapes. Great product if your into thick brow shapes.</li>
            <li> not gonna lie, I messed up my eyebrows when I was a kid. plucked them til they were lines. bad bad job of it too. I fill my eyebrows in so it looks like I have eyebrows. these help so much to get them done right!</li>
            <li> Product is too soft and not easy to work with...</li>
            <li> i do that when my moody ... i wear that for look nice  go out dinner or party or with my bf ..</li>
            <li> I love this stencil kit, love trying different shape of my eyebrow and this thing help me a lot.</li>
            <li> very good to shape your eyebrows, has good  shapes so you can shape them youself and at a great price</li>
            <li> I am able to do it.  It is a little hard or frustrating because you have too get them even and the right way.  I like them.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer</li>
            <li> Stupid. Don&#x27;t waste money on these, unless you want to look stupid.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the stencil plastic is really long so you have to play around a bit to get it perfect. but these give my brows a fabulous shape. i would recommend any day. i use every stencil and they all look great! very natural shapes! love</li>
            <li> These are a lot bigger than I was expecting, and if I were to use them as directed, I would look like a clown. My natural brows are just much much thinner than the size of these stencils, and I think drawing them on this large would make me look like a drag queen. I was disappointed that they were not smaller.</li>
            <li> Product came with half the items missing from box. Company refunded, which is admirable, but I wanted the product. Turns out product was just a piece of paper with cutout of brow shape. Guess i should be glad refund was given.</li>
            <li> I love it, I hate waxing my eye brow its too painful, so I would shape them. The ELF makes great stuff and now I can add Eyebow stencil Kit of ELF products that I Love&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I used to hate having thick, bushy eyebrows. This stencil made me feel blessed! I used it to shape my eyebrows and because of how big and thick they were, I found that i could actually use all of the shapes in this stencil. If you&#x27;re like me, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I seemed to have a hard time with these so ended up not using them</li>
            <li> Received product as described in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product is good, makes it easier to shape my brow. I always have difficulty shaping my eyebrow. This product truly ease the process and helped me a lot. Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item in a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The stencils according to the picture have different arches. I traced them on paper and there is not much difference. I will have look future.</li>
            <li> Its good but its way smaller then I thought.</li>
            <li> So, I just got these today and I am actually REALLY EXCITED!! Hahah, I didn&#x27;t know quite how this was going to go, but they work perfectly!! I just tried them, and am beyond happy to see just how well they work. I have been trying to achieve the perfect brow forever now, and this was all I needed to do that! They are a thick material and are comfortable to place on your face, and are bendable. I take my thumb and index finger to hold the top of the stencil along my brow, then trace my brow with a brown eyebrow pencil. As long as you keep the stencil in the same spot (which honestly is super simple) your brows should look really wonderful! I&#x27;m going to use this every day from now on!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The stencils are well made and easy to use. I just didn&#x27;t really like any of the shapes that well, like none of them felt like they fit my face. But, it&#x27;s a great set.</li>
            <li> I love this. Its easy to use and there are different shapes. So you get to pick the shape you want. It tells you how to use them. I never could do my brows right. So this does the trick. You get the right shape every time.</li>
            <li> I liked that the shipping was super fast! The fact that the stencils were to think and not long enough sucks. they were WAY to thick and the length of them wasn&#x27;t that long, i recommend buying somewhere else. I always had a problem with ELF makeup in general, Don&#x27;t wast your money!!! The only good thing was it shipped fast lol</li>
            <li> Great for shaping natural eyebrows</li>
            <li> These stencils are alright but I would prefer more natural looking ones. If you are making a brow with minimal to no hair then this is fine but my eyebrows are quite thick so it is harder for me to use these.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are way too thick in my opinion. They are also too long so when i use them they swallow up my eye area and i cant use them. Just way too big!</li>
            <li> These are great eyebrow stencils. I use it every day and it has made all the difference in the world for doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The stencils are very helpful because it is hard for me to see up close with out glasses, so this helps me to keep my brow line straight...</li>
            <li> A must have if you have trouble starting your eyebrows or filling them in properly they&#x27;re thick enough but also flexible enough so you can get a good mold of your brow bone when you&#x27;re trying to fill the man</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting perfect eyebrows EVERY time!</li>
            <li> Way to big for my face, they were made for thick and long eyebrows. I use them as a base, but even that is to much.</li>
            <li> Fast ship, like this product</li>
            <li> Your eyebrows are unique for your face.  Shape them to keep their natural shape, tweeze so you dont have a unibrow, and apply powder along the natural shape.  You will end up with something looking MUCH nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stupid stencils are either to big or too small, they are not made for your face, they can slide around, and you end up with big, often crooked, SUPER fake looking eyebrows on your face.  It&#x27;s NOT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the feeling, I tried them too, but ignore the urge to have someone elses brow.  It may not even look good on you.  Accept your real brow, tidy up stray hairs, and do them with a shadow and a setting wax or gel.  See Francios Nars book on eyebrows for a better how-to.</li>
            <li> eyebrows look professional.</li>
            <li> I am so picky about eyebrows, and am always growing them out and coloring them in. They&#x27;re never as thick as I want them to be but this stencil kit proved otherwise. I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for years, so I didn&#x27;t want this kit as a guideline for doing it myself. I color them in almost daily with  powders, shadows, or gels. I wanted to use this kit to make sure I was doing that as even as possible on both sides. While the plastic material is a bit flimsy, I can see how someone might like the flexibility of it. I&#x27;d hate to hate a product, because I think it could be useful to others. Personally, it&#x27;s too thin and short though. Oh and let&#x27;s not forget that this product is literally a dollar through elf! I don&#x27;t use their line so that&#x27;s why I preferred getting it through Prime.</li>
            <li> Even men need to have good eyebrows. I proudly use this and it has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> mom told me that she had trouble putting on eyebrows everyday and that it took her up to an hour every time so I went online and got these for her know it take for a total of 10 minutes. she loves these and I would recommend them for anyone</li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use  and their stencils are not the right size for my very small brows.</li>
            <li> This is a great help in making my eyebrows.  It works very well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> They are way too big and not very practical . I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on these unless you have thick eyebrows is the only way you&#x27;ll be able to use them.</li>
            <li> I find it a useless item.  Very difficult to align both sides to look the same.  I actually bought 3 of these as stocking stuffers, but I don&#x27;t think the recipients even use them.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what it says on the tin.&lt;br /&gt;My brows are longer and thicker than the stencils--which aren&#x27;t labelled btw-- and I don&#x27;t like thin brows so it took a little finessing but I like the end result and fairly happy I got them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Worthless product.</li>
            <li> This is a template kit and has no color or the other questions asked above.  It works well as a template to pencil in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are what we used in class to dye our clients eyebrows, and I think they will do however they are kind of a little flimsy and really do not hold their shape very well, so they are ok to use with eyebrow power, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> These would be OK, if I wanted clown brows. They just don&#x27;t work well at all and are hard to use to get any sort of shape. I don not recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very good self stareter kit, very easy to use, and the color match perfect.  Only used the stencil a cpule of times, then got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would need it because I am growing eyebrows back.  The stencils are flimsy and hard to figure out.  Maybe I would try them if I knew how to use them</li>
            <li> The stencils are way too big. I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I have a very small face and very sparse eyebrows. I was hoping this would help. Unfortunately the small stencil placed the arch in a very different place from the natural arch of my brow causing me to have to shift the stencil around a lot in order to get the whole brow filled in. Also, the bottom of the stencil hangs down into my eye so far that I can barely see (I&#x27;ll try to trim it). Maybe I can play with it some more, but I just don&#x27;t think this item is for me.</li>
            <li> For my purposes it works okay. I use it to apply a light guide to make sure I get my brows an even shape. Placing the guide properly and holding it to the face is rather strange. The ends of the brows are quite rounded and I found it looked very unnatural when I fully filled the stencil.</li>
            <li> Got on time. They work okay.  Some may like it some may not. Even after I drew my eyebrows on using the stencil I still had to go back and extend the tail make them bigger things like that. Not a bad product though. Good for beginners...</li>
            <li> i decided to buy this product because i don&#x27;t know how to shape my eyebrows and when i got this one i started using it and booom i have this beautiful shaped eyebrow :) i&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Helped me out alot</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I had never bothered much with my eyebrows other than randomly plucking at the messy bits - as far as what shape to do them in, I had no clue.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t pluck for a while and grew as much of my eyebrows back as I could, then tried each of the 4 stencils out by filling in with an eyebrow pencil to see which I liked best. The curved arch is my favourite so i filled it in dark so I could see it easily and plucked outside of what I&#x27;d filled in. The stencil was a bit short so i had to extend them a bit by hand.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just use eyebrow powder to fill in to keep the shape. They look SO much better than they used to. Not perfect but for a beginner I would really recommend these. They&#x27;re flexible and pretty easy to use but you do have to be careful to not flex them too much while you hold them or they stretch open and you might not do it even.</li>
            <li> I have fuller eyebrows and this stencil would make me have eyebrows as if I had used a pencil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this the only thing is that I have a very small face and short eyebrows.  I would place the stencil over my eyebrows and it&#x27;s so small compared to the stencil so I filled in what I could and my eyebrows looked exactly like the stencil but in a smaller version.  I love these stencils because without them filling my eyebrows would be a nightmare.  This has totally made my life much easier. I would definitely recommend if you have medium to larger size eyebrows to use this. It will make those eyebrows look gorgeous. I also purchased the eye brow kit from elf as well these 2 items paired together are awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand I&#x27;ve tried of these. I hate them. I love the concept. I love the heavy duty plastic it is. Very durable. But doesn&#x27;t fit my eyebrows. I have to bend them and such just to make it work. They might work for you. Just not me.</li>
            <li> Applying this product is both  and exasperating and awkward. The paper stencils are flimsy and rip easily. I could have done a better job tracing eyebrows on paper and cutting out along the lines . Unless you are extremely patient, you will be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This item came in very quickly and the packaging and contents were everything that I expected. Stencils are great to add to makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend who is learning to do their own makeup and hair now and so far they have been a bonus addition to achieving great brows with little fuss! These have different styles to choose from so they should fit all faces no matter the shape or size!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get both brows identical with just my pencils so i bought the stencils to help. First off they are too bulky and i just discarded the two small ones (which are a joke).&lt;br /&gt;They are just hard to use and keep moving all over my face.  I thought the plastic would stick to my face till I was done. My brows came out worst than when I used just my plain ole&#x27; pencils.  Just a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> fabulous! No need to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; to draw perfect brows on your own.</li>
            <li> These stencils are just what I was looking for. Very good price. The fast delivery is a huge plus as well. Also they provide you with a coupon to use. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> By far this is the worst product I ever used.... save your money and go to a salon everyday if you have to!!!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold up to your eye and use.</li>
            <li> Although not all of the stencils are meant for me, the one that I found most helpful was a great guideline the shape of my eyebrows! I was not sure where to start the process of taming my caterpillars until these stencils helped out. The only thing which I would change would be the packaging, it&#x27;s more complicated than it had to be since there was around 3-6 other small pieces of paper that were not necessary but everything else was fine!</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows and these stencils are AWESOME! Love them!</li>
            <li> It was a good product. I use it all the time to shape my eyebrows. It is not too small for my eyebrows or too big, its the perfect size</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are to big for my face.... i am not pleased with this item. I love the ELF  products...just not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see a person in this world that can use this product. U need to have big freaking eyebrows to use this! It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> Why pay almost $4 for this when it&#x27;s $1 in stores. You can get them from almost any store and if you can&#x27;t find it if you go to there website it&#x27;s still $1.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. The stencils are perfect. I tried one of them out today. They can be a bit thick but you can get around that using a smudge tool and drawing the line thin and then smudge to the thickness you want. Absolutely a great tool for my artist kit.</li>
            <li> Wow. my first purchasing a dress on line and i have no regrets.prefect fit ..I would give score of t</li>
            <li> This is a good idea but very difficult to use. If someone else was putting my make up on it would be easier. I have tried twice and failed so this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> great stencils, my daughter even uses them now</li>
            <li> These are plastic stencils for thinning, thick, or unmanageable eyebrows. There are six stencils of various eyebrow designs in the package.  Using a stencil, use a white pencil to outline the brow. This allows you to tweeze the hair outside the white line.  You can also use a lighter brown or color of choice pencil to draw the eyebrow, remove the stencil, and fill in with light upward and outward strokes. Use a smudge tool to remove the line that you drew with the stencil.  This works really well.</li>
            <li> I love the eyebrow stencils, so easy to use since i&#x27;m no make-up artist to fill them in on my own.</li>
            <li> Great, if you&#x27;re like me that doesn&#x27;t know how to make a perfect brow, these sheets just make it easy, and there&#x27;s different brows shapes, use the one that fit you most!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the material to be a cling type stencil</li>
            <li> I always shaped brows myself tweezing stray hairs. However like another reviewer stated, I discovered over time I&#x27;ve shaped my brows differently on each side. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the shape, either. I&#x27;ve never used stencils and rarely fill mine in, so I decided to buy these and see what&#x27;s to it. With Prime, as usual, shipping was super fast :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened this I had 4 plastic stencils but also 4 paper replicas. I decided these are paper dividers and tossed them. Of the 4 stencils I thought two might work. The first one I tried gave me shapely, angry Joan Crawford brows. So that was a no go. The thinnest one matched my natural arch best but it still looks ridiculous thick as a stencil. I ended up using it as a shaping guideline. I filled in with brow pencil, carefully plucked all hairs outside the shape, then removed all the pencil. The results were just amazing! My brows look even, professional, and somehow fuller - I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously everyone&#x27;s brows are different, ladies blessed with thicker brows can probably pull these off as a stencil. I plan to use this only as a reshaping tool when tweezing. I use NYX brow pencil to lightly fill in by hand on a daily basis. For the price and results I&#x27;m happy :) Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Unreasonable of me to think this could work. Stupid of me to think this would work. You are either born with correct brows or you aren&#x27;t, period.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you get what you pay for.  Once you choose the stencil to use, they are flimsy, awkward and clumsy to work with.  Trying to look in the mirror, place the stencil properly, hold it in place then attempting to trace the outline was not even possible.  You definitely need another person for assistance.  I didn&#x27;t like this product at all and felt I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Either they were too thin, too arched and or too short.</li>
            <li> Found my personal perfect eyebrow shape in this kit.</li>
            <li> Weird shapes, weird sizes, bad material.</li>
            <li> Way to big.. Didn&#x27;t fit my face at all</li>
            <li> Great product! This help me to draw my eyebrow. I clean easy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I imagine if you are very steady, patient, and have excellent manual dexterity this could work.  I had no luck getting symmetry, and I thought the look was unnatural.  Very heavy and overdone.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY hard to see what you are doing, it covers your whole eye, it works a little but absolutely not worth it. I could have done the same thing freehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably going to throw this out or give it to someone...if I can find anyone who wants it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> I love this! I used to be so bad at doing my eyebrows, but now everyone says they are amazing!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it at all, I like my eyebrows better when I follow the natural contour of my eyebrow and draw it in a little with an eyebrow pencil! :)</li>
            <li> I love these stencils! I thought all of them were great styles and I love how much easier my brows are now. They are rather on the thin side and after I use the stencils I have to fatten them up a bit but overall, good stuff. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Great price and easy to be use</li>
            <li> none of the stensils are the right size for your eyebrows. Trying to hold them in place is possible. they are a&lt;br /&gt;This is almost correct. It was actually 114 when I got inn the car, but had dropped a degree by the time I decided to pull over and take a pic. total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This didnt stick or stay in place i only even tried once and gave up. Such a hassle and disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyebrows and any of these stencils seem like they would work for me. I have yet to use them and will update when I do.</li>
            <li> This product came a week before expected shipping, so I was very pleased with that! I love the product itself, but I recommend using this on someone else or have someone else do it on you because it is a little hard to hold it up and fill in your eyebrows at the same time without it slipping because it is a rubbery material, and that is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that I love it and my brows look great:)</li>
            <li> this is only the stencil.  works great!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very easy to use and my eyebrows look on fleek ;)</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say I really didn&#x27;t expect a lot in ordering these as they aren&#x27;t even 5 bucks? BUT, much to my pleasant surprise, these work fantastic!! I have uneven natural brows and these stencils are the first time I&#x27;ve been able to fill them in evenly AND perfectly! They are very easy to use. The one adjustment I did make however, was the stencil was wide so that my viewing while tracing was a bit obstructed, I merely used my scissors and trimmed off of the bottom of the stencil and now they work great! I&#x27;m VERY pleased with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows from over-plucking so I thought stencils and a pencil/powder would help me out some, but no definitely not these stencils. The one stencil that actually matches my eyebrow shape is WAY too thick. Once I got done stenciling it in, I looked in the mirror I was taken back at how ridiculous it looked, they looked like clown eyebrows! Not to mention the stencil itself it quite difficult to work with, you have to place it just right, then tape it down and hope it doesn&#x27;t move out of place. An adhesive of some kind would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still give them two stars though because they&#x27;re inexpensive and the plastic feels sturdy enough despite it having no adhesive, so if they do happen to work for your face shape I can see them lasting a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Great brow choices !!!!  Just need alittle practice and &amp;#34;viola&amp;#34; perfect  eye-brows !!!!! Great deal and price is excellent!</li>
            <li> This was a great idea but it limits the style and shape for your individual brows.  Works great but not my style for brows.</li>
            <li> dosent work at all..... i tried all and no gud. could not use them jus a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and did not like the sketch styles. I now use Anastacia Beverly Hills which you can find at Sephora. Must more durable and natural looking stencil (eyebrow) shapes.</li>
            <li> The stencils came unbroken/ unripped brand new in the box. The shipping was extremely quick- I got it more than a week early than estimated ! The stencils fitted perfectly on my small sized face. Thanks ! I highly recommend this seller and this product!</li>
            <li> Make a great formed brow without looking fake. Several arches to choose from. Thick plastic, will last forever.</li>
            <li> invest some time and just learn how to shape your eyebrows with a pencil. these will obviously not work for every face.</li>
            <li> Using the same products, I&#x27;m able to achieve an eyebrow that lasts all day, which I couldn&#x27;t do before - probably because I was being timid about where to put the shadow. With these, it doesn&#x27;t get it perfect right away, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close - so I can blend from the point that these stencils get me. They are pretty small - if you have larger brows, I&#x27;d maybe use them as a guide for shaping the bottom edge of your brows.</li>
            <li> Hold template of choice on brow and color in with a white eyeliner pencil to define the \\&quot;new brow\\&quot;position on your existing eyebrow. Once you have painted both brows with the white eyeliner pencil (You have to buy white pencil seperately) then pluck around the new drawn shape and wash white off. Super easy. fast! Nice and cheap , very effective!</li>
            <li> Its hard to hold and color at the same time, plus my shape looks odd , i couldnt find a similar one</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say. There are a few different reusable stencils of different shapes; I picked one, used it, and I have nice pretty eyebrows. The end. Yay.</li>
            <li> Great for shaping your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is very economical as far as being able to do your own brows rather than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great for shaping brows and fulling it in. It has 4 different stencils to fit every need of brows. I love it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t manage to use it with a pencil; but it work beautifully with powder.  Just press it hard against the skin and brush powder across it once. Done.</li>
            <li> A very Simple product.&lt;br /&gt;These are a big help when plucking my eyebrows. I put on the stencil, colored in with brow pencil, plucked everything outside.&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful to hold in place on both sides and check for eveness before you start.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t used this yet but when I do I will rate it. I gave it 5 stars because it came quickly &amp; looks great. Neatly packaged &amp; new.</li>
            <li> Great product  will share with others</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready so much quicker in the morning! Love this product! Perfect to get general shape then you just fill it in</li>
            <li> These are really great, and for the price they do their job. I had purchased these for stenciling eyebrows on while doing drag. It&#x27;s helpful if you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to make your eyebrows match up. The best part is their plastic texture which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I just choose the shape I want, put it against my eyebrow, and use my pencil. The shape is exactly as it should be and beautiful.</li>
            <li> these were a great learning tool!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.Great reusble, easy to clean product. Fun and precise.</li>
            <li> The stencil works just as it should, but the one I received looked as if it had already been used.</li>
            <li> Everyone MUST have this !</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and thought it would be cool to have and easy to use. However, the stencils are way too big on my face and I&#x27;m not even a petite person.</li>
            <li> it is one of the silliest purchases I made, I don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> i ordered this from e.l.f. and never recieved it. thanks for nothing!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The stencils are a bit too short.</li>
            <li> They seemed like they would be awesome, but they are really flemsy. And super long. I could use them.</li>
            <li> it was too hard to hold stencil in place and then fill in with the pencil or brush. That&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> stupid me.....Idk why in the world I ordered this.....what a waste of time. it&#x27;s cheap though, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. Although, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but that is my fault. I guess I had a different type of product in mind when I was thinking about getting this product. But, it does do what I want it to do. It has different types of eyebrow shapes in there. Overall, it is a good profuct and I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is easy to use and the plastic material is bendable! But don&#x27;t be deceived; you can go directly to the ELF wesbite, and get thsi SAME set for $1! Just a heads up; times are hard!</li>
            <li> I have large, \\&quot;statement\\&quot; eyebrows and these stencils were HUGE! I looked like I&#x27;d been attacked by my eyebrows when I was done. Hated these stencils!</li>
            <li> The material of this stencil is very soft and sticky, and hard to control&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful to do this job</li>
            <li> I really love how easy to use and accurate this product is. I have recommended this product to my friends who have been trying to archive the prefect eye brow</li>
            <li> my eyebrows may be overarched sometimes or i just want different shape of eyebrows this with eyebrow pencil or powder is a girls best friend</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really any point to it but it was inexpensive and helpful. Any girl that trims her eyebrows a lot would need this</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have had issues with over plucking my brows and this has helped me get back on track. Truly recommend if you want to find the right shape of eyebrow for your face!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet but quick shipping and package came with no problem! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out so I don&#x27;t have to freehand anymore :)  I freehand fine and get lots of compliments that way, it&#x27;s just time consuming :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t for my brows at all, thrown away after a few tries.</li>
            <li> I love this product, you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li> My second order of this product.  I definitely like using it.</li>
            <li> I love it, my eyebrows are even and easy to put on.. but I wish the ends of the eyebrow plastic paper were sharper. But other than that i love it</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed with these stencils. They assume women all have the same eyebrow shape, so they were all completely round and similar in shape. They also come out super funky and lopsided; I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone actually having this shape. I guess for women who have this shape, the stencils will work ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a cheaper alternative to the Anastasia brow stencil line, which is about $20. Only 1 of the stencils will likely work for you since everyone&#x27;s shape and needs are different...unless you&#x27;re blessed w/ thick brows that you can do a lot w/. I am not, I have sparse brows that needed daily filling and I turned to a stencil to make my daily routine faster and identical. Today was my first day using it and I&#x27;m really happy w/ the look! You have to have the right product to do the filling, I use smashbox brow powder duo and set the powder with the wax. This also helps you see where you need to pluck. If I could improve this product I would cut the plastic around it so that it&#x27;s not in my eye...but it is flexible and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll rip easily.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Doesnt help at all. I wish I never purchased this thing at all. At least it was only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Warning: do NOT buy these unless you have full brows with a strong natural arch- unless you plan to completely draw them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use them because my brows aren&#x27;t full or arched enough. But besides that the product is good, easily bent to lay flat on the face, but durable.</li>
            <li> They are pretty shapes for eyebrows, really good price and durable. I use at least once a day and they still look new</li>
            <li> This item is only a stencil, you have to have brow powder, you select the color you need. I find the arch is too high and brow sizes too thin at ends but I can make adjustments free hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted, but I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> hard to hold the stencil in place while trying to apply brow color - maybe it takes practice and patience but I didn&#x27;t have those qualities for this product</li>
            <li> Made my life a whole lot easier. No more crooked lines:)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it&#x27;s really helpful to fill in the brows and create different shapes/styles to add dimensions to your face. It also helps for me to grow out my brows and how I want them to grow out. The stencils are clear/plastic sheets that they have cut outs of the different brow shapes that you want to achieve. It&#x27;s super easy to use and all you do and trace the shape onto your eyebrow and fill in the rest.</li>
            <li> Bought this eye brow kit, because I had no &amp;#34; Defined Brows. This diffentley made a difference.  also by using the Eyebrow Cake it makes it complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They have about 4 different forms to fit you brow style</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not you it&#x27;s me!! When I received so happy and they were stuck together, once I separated tried to use and it was a mess.  I have use other stencil kits with not a drop of drama that these were, would not recommend sorry. SLMS2599</li>
            <li> Thanks to Elf and this kit, my brows can look professionally done, all the time 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product for someone else, but it just wasn&#x27;t for someone like me with thick and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product ever again. they are not user friendly at all. I&#x27;m glad that they were cheap because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use the one that matches my eyebrow every morning.  Gives my eyebrows even shape.  Previously, I just penciled in my brows, but was never even.  Now, they are even every time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like these and my real brows look better than the out come of the stencil shape. I wanted to have a natural arch shaped brow and these make your brows look really long with a short arch at the end.. WEIRD.. Don&#x27;t like and I won&#x27;t even give these to my mom cause she would just look silly. The pic online is not what they look like when you stencil them on,there&#x27;s no thin line part at the end it&#x27;s a little bit thinner than the front bigger part and it looks horrible.. DON&#x27;T buy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure i would be able to position these stencils so that they were natural looking . But after a few times experimenting, I find them very easy to use. I can get a more natural looking shape to my brows now. And it&#x27;s become faster than free handing with pencils or powders alone. I think after I use them for a few more months, I&#x27;ll learn to do it on my own, but until then, these stencils are great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift.  She hasn&#x27;t asked me to return it or throw it out for her, so I guess she likes it.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use if you&#x27;re a beginner but once you get the hang of it, it works so good. My eyebrows look fantastic</li>
            <li> So with this product you really have to find the one that fits your face shape, unfortunately most are not to going to work but you will eventually find one that works for you and you will love it :)</li>
            <li> You have to be smart to use it the right way.. I used it to make my eyebrows even.. And then make my eyebrows the shape that i wanted.. That was all before i started pulling out hairs..</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got a cutout made of paper! I would have thought it would be of a more substantial material! You can hardly feel it on your brow! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stencil kit is exactly as advertised.  However, I find it difficult to hold the stencil in place while applying eyebrow makeup.</li>
            <li> These are the best when your trying to shape your brows, I give this product a 10</li>
            <li> cheep stencil and largely exaggerated. Way too big for my face.</li>
            <li> I find this product very difficult to use - I didn&#x27;t really like it - it was more hassle than necessary</li>
            <li> This package comes with four different shaped stencils. One of them fit my eyebrows perfectly. I use it every day and love it. The plastic is sturdy yet flexible. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sticker to your eyebrow area but overall a good product</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use. I loved the results. I used it to arch my eyebrows with my wax machine.</li>
            <li> WHEN I WAS LOOKING AROUND FOR EYEBROW STENCILS, I COULD ONLY FIND THEM IN&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;KITS\\&quot;...WHERE IT KITS INCLUDED..TWEEZERS,EYEBROW TINT AND/OR COLOR AND&lt;br /&gt;SOME LITTLE BRUSHES AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE KIT...AND SOME OF&lt;br /&gt;THE \\&quot;KITS\\&quot; COULD COST UP TO $50.00 OR MORE DOLLARS BECAUSE THE STENCILS&lt;br /&gt;I SAW WERE ALWAYS IN KITS...UNTIL ONE DAY I WAS ON THE \\&quot;eyeslipsface.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO KNOW AS \\&quot;e.l.f.com\\&quot; AND I WAS SHOPPING FOR SOMETHING ELSE...AND I&lt;br /&gt;RAN ACROSS THE EXACT SAME \\&quot;e.l.f. EYEBROW STENCILS\\&quot; THE SAME EXACT ONE&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;AS SHOWN HERE...AND I WAS SO HAPPY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;KIT...IN ORDER TO GET THE STENCILS...BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT&lt;br /&gt;OVER AT THE \\&quot;eyeslipsface.com\\&quot; THEY SELL THIS SAME EXACT 4pc EYEBROW&lt;br /&gt;STENCIL&#x27;S FOR $1.00...NOT $6.00 AS THEY ARE SELLING THEM HERE FOR.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to draw on symmetrical eyebrows, especially since mine aren&#x27;t naturally symmetrical. These are great and my eyebrows now match. Now the other transvestites will stop teasing me! The only downside is that I feel the tail end of the eyebrow is a little too thick. I almost wish one of the stencils was thinner.</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected them to be. To flimsy!</li>
            <li> These helped me pick a new shape for my natural brows and have made a huge change in how even my makeup looks</li>
            <li> If you really have trouble with eyebrows this could help little difficult to draw while holding plastic I. Place</li>
            <li> I have thin brows and have to fill them in each morning. Thought this would make the process faster. The shape that worked for my brows was too thick. I can&#x27;t use these at all.</li>
            <li> These stencils are so difficult to use, and seem really cheap. I thought I was going to rip them apart as I was opening the box.  I did not like them.</li>
            <li> I love this item! I was a little paranoid about buying some stencils I have never used but after trying these I cannot complain! It&#x27;s so easy to use and you can adjust the shape a bit to your liking.</li>
            <li> all the stencils are for ladies with bigger brows - not much for thinner brows.. none of the stencils were a good fit..</li>
            <li> THIS is a must have for anyone who hates plucking their eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t use this for filling in my brows or drawing brows on. What I did was I took a white eye liner and then matched the stencil to my brow colored my brow white (everything inside the stencil) then plucked everything not colored. I could never get my eyebrows the same trying to free hand so this works great for showing me what and what not to pluck. I have a variety of brow shapes so They dont have to be the same everytime.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit.  Nice shapes, close to my own.  It will take practice though, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This was pretty useless and fell apart, quite literally. The stencils don&#x27;t stick and the entire purpose of this is a bit of a mystery. Ended up buying a proper stencil kit from ULTA.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly when I used them. I had absolutely no issues. It came on time. To top my great experience off, the seller left a cute little note saying thank you for my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> After many deliberations in choosing an Eyebrow Stencil Kit, this one seem like the best and I must say it was a good choice and perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use and durable....No regrets!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
            <li> Love these stencils..it takes a little practice but its really easy and looks great. great buy for the price</li>
            <li> Its okay, I think that I would think twice again for paying almost $6 for 4 pieces of plastic eyebrow shapes, that I could honestly just cut off from the internet.... Not worth the price AND the shipping....</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to give a more appealing shape to me eyebrows. The set features several shapes that you can choose from and while some can be too long, you&#x27;re bound to find something that fits.I also found that when pressed against your brow, it sticks a little bit which makes the stencil easier to use. After defining the shape of my brow with the stencil and through plucking I found that I do not need to use these daily, but I keep them to help me out with any eyebrow changes I may want to make in future. Also, this is $1 on the ELF website so to me it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> These stencils are thicker than expected, but give a great look and shape to your brows. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I just discovered how a lot of women make the perfect brow!  I thought it was pure skill but then its the ELF stencil.</li>
            <li> They are ok, not what I thought they would be</li>
            <li> very nice good quality</li>
            <li> This kit comes with 4 awesome eyebrow styles.  The stencils are a bit smaller than my natural eyebrows, which are fairly thick, but by first doing the bottom and then moving the stencil up and doing the top, it works perfectly.  Every shape looks natural and defined. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t feel like I can complain much....but I&#x27;m still going to complain. :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of the eyebrows in this kit are just WAY too big for my face. I have a very slender brow. Only two of the stencils actually look good with my face shape. The other thing is that boy, does this plastic make the skin underneath it sweat like crazy. But I suppose that&#x27;s what happens when you block all airflow to an area. It may be something I try again in winter, but trying to paint these puppies on in mid-day is an uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it for the fun factor? For sure. I&#x27;m an e.l.f. fan for life - the things were cheap and would definitely serve their purpose had they met my shape criteria.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! GREAT SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Wish these had a sticky to go with them to keep them in place, it&#x27;s rather hard to maneuver them while trying to stencil in the brow color.</li>
            <li> Great product u get exactly what you order!nice price and product! I recommend it extremely! Great product very pleased! Awesome!</li>
            <li> A bit thinker than my previous set, but is a good quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a single problem with the shipping. I use Elf less often  than I would like ( in my area its kinda hard to find but when you do damn are those savings good!) So when this came across my screen I didn&#x27;t even bother looking for other stencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 really tiny issues I was bombarded with paper when I opened them. They have paper separators with eyebrow cutouts, and mine were all undone, kinda reminded me of eyebrow shaped snow. Again not a great big deal its paper, I&#x27;m not going to cry over paper.&lt;br /&gt;And I did have to trim the plastic around the Eyebrow mold or whatever you want to call it because it did cover my eye lids and kinda poked me, But I have a small rounded face just something that I have to deal with once in awhile, but again it wasn&#x27;t any real issue with the product itself</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product - nice clear patterns easy to use and seems easy to last for awhile thanks</li>
            <li> These Stencil Has been very helpful to me. I had them for about a year. I have no complaints</li>
            <li> makes it easier to draw my brow.. great product</li>
            <li> Bad idea, i do not know how to use these properly as they dont come with instructions and now they sit in the bottom of my makeup bag never to be used again. NOT worth what i paid</li>
            <li> Makes perfect eyebrows!! Love these. I use it cosmetic gel eyebrow gel and these stencil make eye look great</li>
            <li> so great, makes my eyebrow shape look fantastic, I always get compliments on my eyebrows now</li>
            <li> Perfect help for defining my brows.</li>
            <li> Might be me but I think it sucks. The designs are too thin for my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to apply my own makeup and do my own face, this is a great product for teaching me how to do just that.</li>
            <li> Whenever i try to do my eyebrows free handed, they end up looking horrendous and super drawn on. With this stencil, my eyebrows look pefect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them everyday since they got here and Utube has a video on how to use them. Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> These seem like they would mold to your face well to fill your eyebrows, but that isn&#x27;t helpful when none of them come even close to the natural shape of your eyebrow. Perhaps I have a high natural arch, but all of them where too flat and didn&#x27;t come close to fitting my eyebrow. I also felt that the soft plastic, although good to conform to your face shape, may easily become warped over time, as there is nothing connecting the arch like most eyebrow stencils. Unfortunately, they will be going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Very disappionted. Way too long and large. Waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for in these instances. Perhaps i will try another brand.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchase I have made in a long time.It was a very good investment. I could do my eye brows and it looks good every time I leave the house. I am saving money every month, because I don&#x27;t have to pay to get it done.</li>
            <li> Sadly Did not meet my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Floppy plastic stencils that move &amp; make your face sweat while trying to use them</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this product  agin...</li>
            <li> The stencils were all to long and none of them came close to the shape of my natural eyebrows. I covered my natural brows with glue and primer and drew on brows with the stencils and none of them fit my face the all made my brows start in to close or extend way too far. Not for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, kind of big for my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in the beginning of the month and received them just a couple days ago. Shipping was just perfect. I&#x27;ve used one so far and it&#x27;s amazing. Comes with different shapes and one of them was just right for me.</li>
            <li> This thing sucked so bad...</li>
            <li> Used it once to shape my brows, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it. I think I&#x27;d rather do it myself than use these.</li>
            <li> It was on time and a little early its good just have a hard time holding it and shading it in but that&#x27;s just me though lol</li>
            <li> Sooo helpful and perfect for airbrush makeup!! &amp;#60;333</li>
            <li> Got this at the store. It&#x27;s only for people who want thick man brows.</li>
            <li> They are great. Now my eye brows stylish:)</li>
            <li> The stencils are flimsy plastic and do not stay on the brow easily when I try to fill in the stencil area. Maybe with a little more practice using the stencils it will get more effective. There are several different shapes, so the selection is adequate for any need.</li>
            <li> The stencils are too big and don&#x27;t fit my face. I can&#x27;t align them according to the instructions because they are too wide.</li>
            <li> These brow stencills are awful they look like a bad brow job. :(</li>
            <li> These are way too big and are completely useless. I wish i wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> Too big and long for my face. There&#x27;s only one that fits but it&#x27;s one with a big arc I don&#x27;t like arcs on my face it makes me look like a witch. If you like your eyebrows think and long then these are perfect.</li>
            <li> The stencils worked well meaning that the edges stayed on point and gave the desired look.</li>
            <li> These stencils are nice- but they are too big for my small face. I love the shapes but was looking for something that was smaller, since it makes it hard to use them. I keep thinking there is an easier way to use them- and every time it is too difficult. This has been true of all eyebrow stencils- not just these. I love the concept though and will not give up on them, as they are very elegant looking if I could master the technique!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea but there is understandably no way to make a fit for everyone so I gave a second star since the sizing could me and not the manufacturer. Had they fit they would have been at least a four. For me, nothing fit, I even tried trimming, they will end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Create cartoon eyebrows that are way to big for anyone&#x27;s face, and look silly doing it! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Each size was WAY to small for my eyebrows , and my eyebrows arent even that thick . Not worth it .</li>
            <li> Elf Eyebrow stencils look useless . I bought the same thing at Wal-Mart  for a dollar. There not what I saw , or I would never had ordered them!</li>
            <li> The paper that was used for the stencils is pretty lightweight. Maybe I should have stuck it to my brow somehow to make it easier to fill.</li>
            <li> Way way way to big for normal eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They give a nice variety of shapes.  I picked out my favorite and it&#x27;s the only one I use. Just be sure to wipe it off before and after each use.  That way you don&#x27;t make a mess on your face.</li>
            <li> i love this eyebrow stencil kit. Everywhere else Ive looked had them for 4 times the price. These work very well and I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> these are really hard to use in either form. to fill your eyebrows in, the plastic moves all the time and its hard to get it even. to pluck, its still hard to fill the brows in in order to pluck around. the shapes are nice though, but a little long.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this item, the application was a little difficult.  I ended up taping with medicine tape in place on face and shading in eyebrow area, then plucking the ones that were on the outside.  I would have given it 5 stars if I would have had a different way to keep the stencil in place.  Love that you get 4 different stencils and the directions were good and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea and concept for beginners like myself but it&#x27;s a bit counter productive. I find it easier to use my Tarte architect brow pencil free hand.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was a cool fun idea but Not so much! It&#x27;s useless and not practical.</li>
            <li> I was born with scanty eyebrows. They aren&#x27;t long and they aren&#x27;t thick. These stencils are cut from thick plastic and are pretty sturdy; the various shapes available should be enough to please anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have to go somewhere and look like I have eyebrows, I use these. Every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If/when they wear out, I&#x27;ll buy another set ASAP.</li>
            <li> I use this stencil every day when I airbrush my makeup.  It has several arches that would compliment any face.  I outline the stencil with my press and pull wax.  What a time and money saver!</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my eyebrows, unlike the rest of me, have gotten thinner. This multi pack has several different styles and sizes, so finding the correct look is easy.&lt;br /&gt;The stencil itself is a heavy but flexible clear plastic, which allows you to start with your own brow line. This makes it easy to shape and/or fill in your own brow to get a natural looking result.&lt;br /&gt;As they do not have adhesive they leave no sticky mess on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are way too small....</li>
            <li> These may work for women with petite brows, but they are way too small for me.  Anastasia high arch is still the best for me.</li>
            <li> Since my face is not flat, this is difficult to use, but it did give me a pattern to work on that was better than me using my imagination to try to figure out if both eyes looked the same or were the shape I wanted.  After I used it a few times I had the idea of what I wanted to do, so I don&#x27;t use it any more.  It did accomplish what I needed, and a smart woman shouldn&#x27;t have to be told over and over how to paint her face, right?</li>
            <li> the plastic stencil seemed like a good idea but the outer edges take up much of my face making it harder to trace my eyebrow&lt;br /&gt;i end up just free handing it which take a bit longer cause im still in the learning process</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Bought two sets, one for myself, one for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect way to shape your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the eyebrow stencils! I shared with a friend! These help you get the perfect arch!  Great price for the set!</li>
            <li> O tried it a couple of times…  not that great</li>
            <li> Very difficult to hold in place and have the ability to hold the eyebrow powder brush at the same time. Need another hand or person!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit a few months ago and never got around to writing a review. Honestly, I appreciate what E.L.F was trying to do with this but I don&#x27;t find it helpful at all.&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought it I haven&#x27;t used it once, I just feel my eyebrows will look much too fake if I follow the stencils they provided in this set. I love E.L.F&#x27;s other products but I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is just starting with penciling their brows. It is a great help to have the stencils to help you make sure that both brows are the same length and thickness. They are reusable and with the thickness of the plastic/vinyl material the stencil can easily be wiped or cleaned if necessary.</li>
            <li> Incredible magic my eye brown look so good</li>
            <li> i bought these brows for my teen because shes been having a hard time making her own thick brows even and appealing</li>
            <li> Good, but not for me....I gave away, I&#x27;m just not a fussy girl.  These might have been great...on a less fussy girl</li>
            <li> I have a small face and thin eyebrows so I just wanted to make them a little fuller but these stencils were way too big. Didnt look good.</li>
            <li> These are a really good idea. A lot of us women could use them.  They were all so huge that I (and I have an avg to lg face) couldn&#x27;t use even one of the stencils.  Easy to use. Just didn&#x27;t fit.  My original order of this product was lost in the mail. When I emailed the seller a replacement set was in my mailbox in two days. Very much appreciated!</li>
            <li> This purchase was an alternative to the stick on disposable stencil by Fran Wilson Instant Brows. I didnt like the disposable ONLY because, I had to re purchase them. Otherwise, they are perfect. Now for the ELF stencil, its pretty much the same, excluding you have a variety and they are reuse-able. I like REUSEABLE, but because they dont stick on and Im not so coordinated, I go out the lines, which is the purpose of the stencil. I will use these when I run out of my Fran Wilson brows.</li>
            <li> Works and makes my life easier. &#x3D;&#x27;)</li>
            <li> This is a great guide to fill in eyebrows. Fail proof!</li>
            <li> Love It....... Perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, especially for those of us who find ourselves almost without eyebrows. I used it several times and was satisfied with the effect, but after a week or so decided to go back to drawing my own outline.  Even the thinest of these was too thick for an old lady&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils aren&#x27;t cheaply made, they&#x27;re actually very nice.  I just wish they fit my shape of eyebrows and we a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I tried them out and wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled.  The stencils themselves are nice enough and are easy to clean off because they&#x27;re plastic.  None of the sizes or arches looked good on me.  Even the smallest stencil made me look like Bert from Sesame Street.</li>
            <li> I really like these stencils. My eyebrows look amazing when I use them. People are always like &amp;#34;Did you go get your eyebrows done?&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m like nope! lol I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I like these very much, I always have the problem of over plucking one eyebrow and trying to get the other to match and always end up doing to much and looking a bit crazy. These help me get the perfect shape AND matching eyebrows *small applause*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend these eyebrow stencils.</li>
            <li> Okay.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love the stencil kit! My eyebrows look amazing from it! I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These eybrow stencils are great, but I think that they are a bit too square and thick though they helped me when I had close to no eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love these! They are easy to use. I prefer one over the others but I like having the option to pick from a few &amp;#34;styles&amp;#34;. You can&#x27;t beat the price.  It&#x27;s worth having this in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Worked really well to help me get my eyebrows shaped again.</li>
            <li> I am going through chemotherapy and losing your eyebrows is one of the side effects. These stencils give me perfect brows every day. It is a variety of 4 shapes</li>
            <li> Great stencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out the best but ok.</li>
            <li> The stencils are quite big, so I had to cut them at the bottom part so I could actually open my eye a bit so I could see what I was doing better. I thought I was going to find one stencil that would be on the end of thinner eyebrows but I didn&#x27;t. If you like your eyebrows a big bigger and fuller then you will be OK with this kit.</li>
            <li> This was too hard to keep placed in the eyebrow area for me.  Maybe if someone else was helping with it, it would be easier.  Woulld&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled what I have been searching for for a while. I am very pleased with the time and condition of the products.</li>
            <li> Horrified to realize my brows were too thin. Who thought bigger brows were ever coming back?!</li>
            <li> The review is asking me how the color is? It&#x27;s a stencil, not actual make-up. So that&#x27;s kind of silly. But as a stencil, it&#x27;s awesome I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I gave them to somebody else , considering I paid almost $10 for it it was a waste . But I guess if you have short lengthed eyebrows it works out fine but it didn&#x27;t help me like I hoped .</li>
            <li> just what i need to help make the perfect brows. i use them every day. i like that they are very thick.</li>
            <li> For a dollar it&#x27;s fine. But I had an old set from ardell that was a lot better shapes. These are also not stiff plastic but sort of jelly ish. Which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Came on time and I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I put a 4, because not very easy to hold the stencil, he drives off and then need to paint an eyebrow. Ideally I was approached by one option. the other 3 you can give to your friends, mother ..</li>
            <li> This is a very neat product and I love the brand. It will work very well for those who take care of their eyebrows and have them correctly shaped. I on the other hand have messed up eyebrows because I am lazy and shave my brows instead of taking the time to pluck them. My brows were WAY smaller than the stencil, so they didn&#x27;t really work well with mine, but I think they would work wonders for other people.</li>
            <li> They are helpful , a like difficult to use, but shouldnt b sold for 4.99, in Target They r 99 cents</li>
            <li> I love that this kit has a variety of arches to choose from.  There are thin, medium &amp; thick stencils so anyone can find the stencil that closely matches their own eyebrows.  Not like other stencil kits that only have one stencil, every person doesn&#x27;t have the same eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The different shapes are AWESOME! i am so excited to test this out for an big party tonight :D thanks soo much and i recommend anyone whos new to eyebrow shaping or even someone who has for awhile that still get there eyesbrows pretty cricked to try lol its wonderful</li>
            <li> it is ok ,but not v good</li>
            <li> None of the shape is for me...And eyebrow  shaping is still a hard thing for me now ..what a pity..</li>
            <li> Useless. 4 different sizes and not one fits my eyebrows. Needless to say I can&#x27;t even use it. Holding it to your eye is difficult</li>
            <li> They are cheap and nice, I just don&#x27;t know how to apply it fully, I&#x27;m new though. It&#x27;s what it looks like.</li>
            <li> Difficult to place properly. I can never get them in just the right spot. It would also be much easier to use if there were some kind of adhesive and/or a guide to placement. They slide around a lot, gap and are tricky to fill in.</li>
            <li> Nice shapes but they are way too thin and small</li>
            <li> very awkward to hold and To make sure both sides are even and to try to color At the same</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom, she loves them :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I know how to work these</li>
            <li> There is no color involved.  The stencil worked great for me to practice on what the final view should look like.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit.  I can mix the shades to get a custom shade or use each alone. The brush is nice for applying, you have the spiral brush for combing and the wax for setting.  There are several stencils so you can try different shapes.  They are a bit big but not too hard to hold and apply the powder.  I was looking for something so that I could get even brows and shape and this works for me.</li>
            <li> Five stars...enough said.</li>
            <li> The stencils are HUGE. Once I got them and held it up for comparison I was extremely disappointed. Unless I wanted eyebrows the size of caterpillars, these are useless. Would NOT buy again.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this item. Did not help me save time as I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this because it turns out not as huge as some reviewer said. I have the most pathetic eyebrow and it looks like the only one (or two) I could use is the smallest one(s), but they do the job.</li>
            <li> As far as the effects that the stencils are made to achieve they do that. The application however is another thing. They&#x27;re very hard to hold with one hand and then stencil on the brow powder or eye shadow onto the stencil. I used it literally probably twice and now they&#x27;re sitting in the unused make-up graveyard which is the trash. :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I needed an eyebrow stencil until I added this to an order just to increase the price to get my add on items delivered lol. But there&#x27;s multiple sizes and shapes and gives both eye brows a uniform shape. I really like it</li>
            <li> Great variety of shapes for those with not much eyebrow! A little hard to use at first but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Ok, wouldn&#x27;t order again. Hard to hold in place and make it look natural.</li>
            <li> Nice shapes but hard to use on my own brows... Can&#x27;t hold them in place while applying brow color. They slip around.  Some removeable adhesive is needed.</li>
            <li> These are enormous. There&#x27;s no way anyone would use these on their face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about everyone else who says the stencils are too large, but for me they aren&#x27;t. They are exactly what I expected and they are easy to hold. They bend easily and if you have trouble holding them just take some tape and place it exactly where you need it, out line your brow, and then pluck or shave whatever is outside of what you traced. Be sure to outline them both before you begin so you can get them as even as possible.</li>
            <li> A little more flimsy that expected but it does the job for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I like to re shape my eyebrows every once in a while and this works great and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better quality. The stencils are kind of hard to use. If you have lots of time to do your makeup, then they will probably work fine for you.</li>
            <li> I got these as an experiment after hearing people discussing them. I actually thought they would be hilariously awful, but they do have some selling points. If you aren&#x27;t creative with using these stencils, you could end up looking like a clown. Try lining them up with your own brows and lightly tracing the top of the brow outline with a small brush and a medium shade of brownish shadow. Work it from there to follow your own natural shape. It requires real experimentation and practice to get the look you want. If you want to try them out, I say it&#x27;s worth the money to see what they can actually do for you, after all, you may be really pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Waste of money...my girlfriend warned me.  I can do it better free hand.</li>
            <li> Amazing price! Works beautifully!</li>
            <li> received it in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I like the kit but the bar code was put over the directions so I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  Can I get a set of directions sent to me?  Otherwise the kit itself looks fantastic and was delivered quickly but I just want to use it the proper way.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> have even eyebrows everytime! my eyebrows can now be twins instead of sisters! shipping was fast and was packaged nicely, thank you</li>
            <li> This stencils are useless they are so small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> These are good for getting the perfect shape for your eyebrows. no complaints</li>
            <li> These were not what I was expecting but I was happy with the product! The shape of the stencels is a little smaller that I had imagined. That being said, it is a nice quality product that is easy to use. The package was sent and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I have made the grave mistake back in high school to overpluck my eyebrows. Now that I am in college, I am growing them back out and well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as simple as it sounds. I do not really have the time and money to go to the salon to do my eyebrows. I have tried many times to achieve a nice shape, but somehow it always comes out uneven. So, I saw a YouTube Guru (FamusLady) use this and looked on the e.l.f. website to see how much they were. It costs one dollar, but I had to pay 7 dollars in shipping and handling (I was only getting the stencils alone). So, I looked on Amazon instead and got a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of these stencils are nice and the box it comes with is very easy to open. It comes with four stencils inside. I did a hard time in the beginning trying to find which eyebrow arch belongs to what stencil because the name wasn&#x27;t labeled on the stencil. The material of these stencils is a very bendable and soft plastic. However, It is not flimsy and it is very durable. I wish these were just a tad bit tougher. When these are placed on the eyebrows, they do cover the eye. So, please trim the extra plastic, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stencil Use: (My intended use for the stencils was to shape and define my eyebrows for tweezing)&lt;br /&gt;First, I use the preferred stencil (My shape was the Structured Arch) and match it to my eyebrows before fill them in using a white eyeliner pencil (or a very dark colored eyeliner); making sure that both of my eyebrows are lined up evenly after shading them in. Of course, the eyebrows are not going to look \\&quot;picture perfect\\&quot; immeadiately after the brows are filled in. Don&#x27;t be afraid to adjust the shape to compliment your facial structure (e.g: by extending the tail or shortening the line if it is too long). After everything is finished, tweeze (or wax, whichever you prefer) the area that is NOT shaded in by the eyeliner pencil and that should be about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, They are some eyebrow tutorials on Youtube that talks about how to properly fill in eyebrows, be sure to check them out and see which method works best for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;The stencils worked great for me, but I can understand how some individuals can have issues with it. If your eyebrows do not naturally have a definite arch. Please save yourself the trouble by not purchasing this. Practice makes perfect with the use of any stencil. It can be a little slippery, but I had it for a day and got a handle of it in 5 minutes. Some may not be so lucky in that aspect. If one does not have a steady grip (or have a shaky hand), you may not want to purchase this either. For the price, it is worth a try. I, personally, would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck. :)eyebrow tutorials on Youtube that talks about how to properly fill in eyebrows, be sure to check them out and see which method works best for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;The stencils worked great for me, but I can understand how some individuals can have issues with it.

            <li> Awesome product!  My eyebrows are beautiful with the help of this stencil kit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it arrived on time. Aside from being not too pricey, the product serves it purpose. Now, i can play with my brows on any desired shape i want. Its so useful and worth the price. I just love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, came quick, very happy customer 😊</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but only because I have just started using stencils. I find that I like the colored stick on kind better. I have to use magnification to color my brows and that is a little difficult when I have to hold the stencil and it&#x27;s clear so it blends in with my skin tone. Overall worth the money though.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, but wish it worked for &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; brows</li>
            <li> These come in a pack of four and are good enough quality.  I only gave them four stars because I found other  companies that offer a larger selection along with helpful tips/links.</li>
            <li> There are definitely better out there, even for the price.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t long enough in the open shape to be an eyebrow and the surrounding &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I threw them out already.</li>
            <li> I just love them they are so awesome and do a great job thank you :) im so happy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great instructions &amp; tips if you also check out the E.L.F cosmetics website. Easy to use &amp; straight forward. Love &amp;#60;3</li>
