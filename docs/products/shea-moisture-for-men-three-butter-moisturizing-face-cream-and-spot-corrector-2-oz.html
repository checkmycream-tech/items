            <li>The best price for a quality item that I will re-order without question...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, moist and helps prevent ingrown hair</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully however!</li>
            <li>good stuff!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Outstanding!!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion; it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, and honestly I think its a great product.</li>
            <li>I switched to this one for that reason and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be badger hair or not.</li>
            <li>Great product, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>TRENDSKIN IS A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT TO TREAT IN GROWN HAIRS .</li>
            <li>Goes on much better this way.</li>
            <li>but the manufacturer needs to work on its consistency so it can be applied better.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are gone</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>This after shave is great for people with sensitive skin, it works really well!</li>
            <li>When applied it gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has greatly helped with my dry skin and shaving shadow.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about products like this that contain shea is that they tend to mattify my skin and prevent it from getting oily, but also intensely hydrate.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product because of its natural ingredients and very mild scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look super matte and even.</li>
            <li>This is an organic aftershave cream and moisturizer which has a very pleasant feel and smell and which helps revitalize just-shaved skin while helping prevent or at least minimize razor burn.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local Walmart and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the intense hydration Burt&#x27;s Bees facial lotion that I loved but without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>really want to love this product because the first ingredient is shea butter and not water like most other face lotions</li>
            <li>I love how soft and clear this keeps my combination skin.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their skin care products to the fellas!</li>
            <li>Regardless of wether your skin is sensitive or regular, I truly recommend this product as it&#x27;s worked very well for me and at $6.99 (the price I paid at Walmart)</li>
            <li>All natural, not a chemical in it.</li>
            <li>One other thing to be aware of is that this product does take a bit of effort to completely rub in, especially around stubble/facial hair.</li>
            <li>Like other shea moisture products, he really likes this.</li>

            <li> This product only works if your face is COMPLETELY DRY.</li>
            <li> One small tip, always keep this bottle upside down, this way you can easily get what you need with a little squeeze.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for men with similar hair as my husband, dark, coarse.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to merkur safety razor and upgraded my skin care products after some careful research.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry skin and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Just getting into shaving this way, so no real way for me to compare.</li>
            <li> Also, wet your hand before putting it on your hand then use it.</li>
            <li> If your face is not completely dry it will be similar to applying cold butter to a soft piece of bread.</li>
            <li> Look at other sites but none could beat this price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick you can do this multiple times.</li>
            <li> Your face cannot be damp from washing it or even a little</li>
            <li> I have use this before so not much more than that to say but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really that expensive.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a pump bottle instead of this stiff, hard bottle that makes it really difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> bottle for this product is really annoying.</li>

            <li> I recently switched to merkur safety razor and upgraded my skin care products after some careful research. This along with the Shea moistures facial scrub and tea tree bump preventer, Shea moisture and I are gonna be friends for life. I highly recommend their skin care products to the fellas!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Walmart and am very pleased with it.

            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME..TRENDSKIN IS A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT TO TREAT IN GROWN HAIRS . DON&#x27;T FALL FOR THE ADVERTISING OF THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Great product. All natural, not a chemical in it. A lot of reviews mention the thickness what I&#x27;ve found is add some water to the bottle and shake well. It&#x27;s so thick you can do this multiple times. Also, wet your hand before putting it on your hand then use it. Goes on much better this way. Clears acne, spots, you name it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  Gave to another friend who also loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion; it works wonderfully. It reminds me of the intense hydration Burt&#x27;s Bees facial lotion that I loved but without all the chemicals. I switched to this one for that reason and I&#x27;m glad I did! I love how soft and clear this keeps my combination skin. The thing I love about products like this that contain shea is that they tend to mattify my skin and prevent it from getting oily, but also intensely hydrate. It makes my skin look super matte and even. Growing up I had terrible skin, but now I often get compliments on how wonderful my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle for this product is really annoying. I wish it came in a pump bottle instead of this stiff, hard bottle that makes it really difficult to squeeze. One other thing to be aware of is that this product does take a bit of effort to completely rub in, especially around stubble/facial hair.</li>
            <li> This after shave is great for people with sensitive skin, it works really well!</li>
            <li> good stuff! Will by again!</li>
            <li> This product only works if your face is COMPLETELY DRY. If your face is not completely dry it will be similar to applying cold butter to a soft piece of bread. Your face cannot be damp from washing it or even a little sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to love this product because the first ingredient is shea butter and not water like most other face lotions but the manufacturer needs to work on its consistency so it can be applied better.</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my husband. Like other shea moisture products, he really likes this. Would recommend for men with similar hair as my husband, dark, coarse.</li>
