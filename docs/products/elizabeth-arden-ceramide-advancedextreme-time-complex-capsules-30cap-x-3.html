            <li>I&#x27;m sixty-five and teach Theatre Arts, and am often in a lot of makeup (the kind that will kill your skin).  </li>
            <li>I think Elizabeth Arden is one of the best brands in beauty products, ceramide really works.</li>
            <li>This is the best value by far.</li>

            <li>When EA came out with Plump Perfect (the upgrade of the moisturizer that&#x27;s used with these caps), I didn&#x27;t see much difference between that and the original, either . . .</li>
            <li>I would still recommend spending the money on the gold capsules, because they are lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ceramides for twenty-five years and am glad to find them here.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the gold caps work any better than these, and these are a steal.  </li>
            <li>my mother, two sisters have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still waiting for the magic to happen.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using ceramide capsules for years and love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I love these capsules.</li>

            <li>I used to work for Elizabeth Arden in a department store many years ago, and used them then.  </li>
            <li>Turns out, it is the newest, latest packaging and my Mom went gaga over it -</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older and you haven&#x27;t used lotions in your life, these might hydrate you very nicely.</li>
            <li>Very light texture but fantastic results</li>
            <li>Glad to still see it available.  </li>
            <li>The Serum is very light but so rich.</li>
            <li>The are easy for travel use as well, no bottles to take up space in your luggage.</li>

            <li>strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>as good as the new ceramide capsules</li>
            <li>I notice the difference of fewer visible fine lines.</li>
            <li>But seemed fine.</li>
            <li>A great product to help keep your skin looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li>Will continue buying until it available.</li>
            <li>I change from Clinique to Elizabeth Arden and are light products.</li>
            <li>My neck daily great</li>
            <li>They are full size items.  </li>
            <li>good product will order again in future.</li>
            <li>Initally it feels a little bit oily, but just keep massaging it on the face, you will feel the skin is absorbing it, very good feeling!</li>
            <li>I like these better than the new capsules out there, so keep ordering them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>But after checking the code on it, it is still fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received several, courteous n follow-up calls from both reassuring me that the 3DD3 is the Date of MANUFACTURING</li>
            <li>first time I used this it was soft capsules and easy to use</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules for many years, and everyone thinks I look younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>Does nothing more than just using regular  vitamin E oil on the face.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use a serum product</li>
            <li>I am willing to try them.</li>
            <li>Introduced by way of a gift and have used it consistently ever since.  </li>
            <li>My skin still looks soft and smooth and largely wrinkle-free because underneath all the gunk I have the oil from these caps and the EA moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase this again if the deal stays reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and I am pleased that the price I paid is cheaper than the department stores</li>
            <li>And easy to open.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and absorbs quickly and is not sticky like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>These were a good deal for 3, however they&#x27;re hard and need to be opened with a scissor.</li>
            <li>and I have moisturized my face my whole life, so</li>
            <li>These capsules definitely make my face feel smooth and silky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ceramide on my face for years-it really combats dryness and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>, I feel that they really do give my skin a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>This the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>soft skin with a radiant glow, glowing skin with a creamy white complextion thus providing more confidence, beauty snd pride</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve come home late and fallen asleep in full makeup</li>
            <li>I only have had it for a few days but so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Can t live without it !</li>
            <li>These are the older model caps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my significant other uses it too and his skin is so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I wonder why EA raise the new version capsule price so high</li>
            <li>These moisturize nicely but the capsules are pretty hard to open.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without them</li>
            <li>moisturizes very well for all skin types goes on smoothly no oily residue makes your skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years but is getting hard to find in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Am glad to have found it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products at friends&#x27; recommendations, but have always (very quickly) come back to Ceramides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 48 yrs old and this product has helped me to fight off wrinkles for years.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they were old.</li>
            <li>mine were soft n</li>
            <li>Skin seems considerably smoother.  </li>
            <li>I purchased them over 1 yr old.</li>
            <li>when I received this product because the date on the product was over a year old - cosmetics have a shelf life of 1 year.  </li>
            <li>i got them for  my mom for christmas, she has been using these for years and her skin is so soft and unwrinkled</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my mother who had tried the newer model but, didn&#x27;t want to pay such a high price.</li>
            <li>ended up re-ordering these for my mom, and the 2nd time they were normal and not hsrd.</li>
            <li>At first I was little worried about the production date about it since this type of capsule was already out of normal market.</li>
            <li>Obviously product old and on shelf for a while.</li>
            <li>will start tomorrow a.m. to check out the quality, since I have used the samples various stores gave to me to see if I would have a reaction to them (have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>And the vitamin e costs a whole lot less than this.</li>

            <li> I have used this product before, and this is the same thing as I expected</li>
            <li> I love the ceramide capsules, but they&#x27;re sooo expensive to buy from Elizabeth Arden!</li>
            <li> The newer caps are easier to open and the product is less viscose.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> My skin is  very dry.</li>
            <li> Capsule a little harder to twist off end than the newest product but same results on the face.</li>
            <li> You do need scissors to open the capsule because they harden with age, which again emphasizes the product is past</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product in a big Department store.  </li>
            <li> These capsules arrived unusable - they are so hard they can only be cut w/ scissors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I posted my negative review on Amazon, I received the following email from PerfumesWorld:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you do that, half the liquid spills out.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is not good to buy if it&#x27;s been in a warehouse for a long time.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t tried these and the moisturizer, you&#x27;re really missing out on a quality product.</li>
            <li> I use one capsule everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been using these capsules for a few years.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel your skin with a lot of heavy things on it.</li>
            <li> Still skeptical, I too called Customer Affairs directly to ELIZABTH ARDEN and was told</li>
            <li> The capsules were extremely hard, much harder than usual.  </li>
            <li> I guess they sent us a bad batch the first time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if she&#x27;ll want to buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The capsules were hard and difficult to twist and open to apply to face and neck.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to twist.</li>
            <li> It seems that it is too late to return it</li>
            <li> feedback is negative about the vendor, and not the product.</li>
            <li> Instructions to softem in very small print on information enclosure were not helpful.</li>
            <li> They sent me a return postage and they will send it to lab to see why I received a serious burn when I used the product.</li>
            <li> and my skin is none the worse for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they changed their packaging to a very hard plastic that is difficult fo use</li>
            <li> Got this for her and was a little doubtful because had never seen the packaging like this</li>
            <li> We would appreciate if you removed the erroneous feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> they changed their packaging to a very hard plastic that is difficult fo use&lt;br /&gt;the first time I used this it was soft capsules and easy to use</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and every now and then i try something else--nothing works as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;Now my significant other uses it too and his skin is so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> These moisturize nicely but the capsules are pretty hard to open. I&#x27;m only 36 and I have moisturized my face my whole life, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to look too much different. If you&#x27;re older and you haven&#x27;t used lotions in your life, these might hydrate you very nicely. I would still recommend spending the money on the gold capsules, because they are lovely. And easy to open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ceramides for twenty-five years and am glad to find them here.  Heaven only knows why Elizabeth Arden decided to discontinue the line because it works so well.  I&#x27;ve tried other products at friends&#x27; recommendations, but have always (very quickly) come back to Ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the gold caps work any better than these, and these are a steal.  When EA came out with Plump Perfect (the upgrade of the moisturizer that&#x27;s used with these caps), I didn&#x27;t see much difference between that and the original, either . . . except for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful.  I&#x27;m sixty-five and teach Theatre Arts, and am often in a lot of makeup (the kind that will kill your skin).  My skin still looks soft and smooth and largely wrinkle-free because underneath all the gunk I have the oil from these caps and the EA moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve come home late and fallen asleep in full makeup and my skin is none the worse for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPIRED?  Has anyone bitc*ing about expired capsules even bothered to read up on what &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; means regarding makeup, skin care, hair care, etc.?  It doesn&#x27;t matter, gang!  You can&#x27;t &amp;#34;infect&amp;#34; these because they&#x27;re in separate capsules.  And it&#x27;s oil!  It will be oil until the end of the planet!  Just use it and stop freakiing out about expiration dates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried these and the moisturizer, you&#x27;re really missing out on a quality product.</li>
            <li> I am 48 yrs old and this product has helped me to fight off wrinkles for years. This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> soft skin with a radiant glow, glowing skin with a creamy white complextion thus providing more confidence, beauty snd pride</li>
            <li> i know this is an older product version, but it is wonderful for the skin and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I think Elizabeth Arden is one of the best brands in beauty products, ceramide really works.</li>
            <li> I love the ceramide capsules, but they&#x27;re sooo expensive to buy from Elizabeth Arden! These arrived quickly and the product is wonderful. [And I saved $57!!!]</li>
            <li> great product,speedy delivery. strongly recommended. my mother, two sisters have been using this product for many years. we all love it!</li>
            <li> I use one capsule everyday. Initally it feels a little bit oily, but just keep massaging it on the face, you will feel the skin is absorbing it, very good feeling!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful an so was price, service an shipping.  Would recommend this product to anyone who wants silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my niece in January and just found out from her that the product was expired when she got it.  It seems that it is too late to return it but the description should have noted that it was expired and let the buyer decide whether to buy it or not.</li>
            <li> The capsules were hard and difficult to twist and open to apply to face and neck.  I think this product is not good to buy if it&#x27;s been in a warehouse for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase this again if the deal stays reasonable. These capsules definitely make my face feel smooth and silky plus I think it helps my makeup go on easier and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they were old.</li>
            <li> The capsules were extremely hard, much harder than usual.  I felt like the capsules had been sitting around for a while.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this overpriced crap.&lt;br /&gt;She has to get hypo allergenic , she is allergic to everything except this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the new capsules out there, so keep ordering them from Amazon.  This is the best value by far. One is enough for entire face and neck. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> on the bottom of it is shown&amp;#34;0NC&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;manufactured 2010！！！&lt;br /&gt;no box ,,,no seal&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&lt;br /&gt;you can not image how  terrible are they~~~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the magic to happen. I bought it to remove the lines on my neck, still nothing.  Maybe I have a dud batch.</li>
            <li> Good price and great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Love it.  Goes on easily and absorbs quickly and is not sticky like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ceramide on my face for years-it really combats dryness and wrinkles.  On very cold or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;windy days I put on two applications and I feel that it also helps control coldsores around my &amp;#34;muzzle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And helps control wrinkling around my cheekbones under my eyes.  I have recommended it to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many of my friends-I also feel it helps after laser treatments-I have Rosacea and have had tx to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;break it up&amp;#34;. Ceramide soaks into my skin after about 5 minutes without any lingering oil sheen.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review of this vendor saying that the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules I received from them had an expiration date of January 2013 stamped on the bottom of the box (I received the product in August 2013.) Further, the product had an \\&quot;off\\&quot; odor once the capsule was opened.  You do need scissors to open the capsule because they harden with age, which again emphasizes the product is past it&#x27;s expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;After I posted my negative review on Amazon, I received the following email from PerfumesWorld:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received your feedback.  The date stamped on the item is the manufacturing date and not the expiration date.  The item is good for 3 years from date of manufacture.  These aren&#x27;t samples.  They are full size items.  We would appreciate if you removed the erroneous feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then called Elizabeth Arden consumer affairs to find out about the date they use on their products.  The representative from Consumer Affairs stated that they use EXPIRATION DATE and NOT manufacture date.  She stated that the product I received was expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feedback is negative about the vendor, and not the product. When used within it&#x27;s \\&quot;Use By\\&quot; date, it is an exceptional product.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily for the last 12 years. Excellent anti-aging effect.... And you cannot bit the price. Will continue buying until it available.</li>
            <li> Bought for cousin, he loves it.</li>
            <li> used 1/3, has not seen any good thing happened as what it was posted.</li>
            <li> I have returned the product to Elizabeth Arden.  They sent me a return postage and they will send it to lab to see why I received a serious burn when I used the product.</li>
            <li> My moms loves this stuff, she says is the best anti-aging skin care out there</li>
            <li> I have been using ceramide capsules for years and love the way my skin feels.  The are easy for travel use as well, no bottles to take up space in your luggage.</li>
            <li> At first I was little worried about the production date about it since this type of capsule was already out of normal market. But after checking the code on it, it is still fresh. Real a good deal.</li>
            <li> These capsules arrived unusable - they are so hard they can only be cut w/ scissors. When you do that, half the liquid spills out.  Instructions to softem in very small print on information enclosure were not helpful. Obviously product old and on shelf for a while. Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Have been using these capsules for a few years. They are excellent, and I dread the day I&#x27;m no longer able to find them.</li>
            <li> Excelllent product at excellent price for the amount of capsules the package has. I change from Clinique to Elizabeth Arden and are light products. You don&#x27;t feel your skin with a lot of heavy things on it.</li>
            <li> Only using about three times a week for my skin became to oily for my face.  My neck daily great</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mother who had tried the newer model but, didn&#x27;t want to pay such a high price. These were a good deal for 3, however they&#x27;re hard and need to be opened with a scissor. Not sure if she&#x27;ll want to buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update 8/18/2013&lt;br /&gt;I ended up re-ordering these for my mom, and the 2nd time they were normal and not hsrd. I guess they sent us a bad batch the first time.</li>
            <li> Product was really good value.  Very happy customer</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  Highly recommend it!  Great for keeping your skin soft and smooth.  I use it every morning under my makeup and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wonder why EA raise the new version capsule price so high, actually I don&#x27;t see any difference between  these two versions.</li>
            <li> moisturizes very well for all skin types goes on smoothly no oily residue makes your skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and I am pleased that the price I paid is cheaper than the department stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money. Good amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules for many years, and everyone thinks I look younger than I am.  You gotta Love that!!</li>
            <li> Tried these instead of paying the $90 at dept.store counters for newer product. Capsule a little harder to twist off end than the newest product but same results on the face.</li>
            <li> Will use up what I have, but would not repurchase this product. Does nothing more than just using regular  vitamin E oil on the face. And the vitamin e costs a whole lot less than this.</li>
            <li> The product has a date of February 2013. I checked and seems like that is production date and shelf life is three years. This is the first time I use a serum product and I feel it is very good, leaving my skin some and smooth. I only have had it for a few days but so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> These caplets are good.. They are hard to twist. I like the softer caplets.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Elizabeth Arden at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#60; too, thought my capsules were expired as the date read 4/2013. I called Amazon, who then called the shipper/manufacturer. I received several, courteous n follow-up calls from both reassuring me that the 3DD3 is the Date of MANUFACTURING n that the shelf life is good for 3 yrs.  Still skeptical, I too called Customer Affairs directly to ELIZABTH ARDEN and was told n reassured that it is the Date of MANUFACTURING, not expiration, esp because of the code 3DD3 also on the product. I am willing to try them. mine were soft n will start tomorrow a.m. to check out the quality, since I have used the samples various stores gave to me to see if I would have a reaction to them (have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> This is what I want  I have used this product before, and this is the same thing as I expected</li>
            <li> I love these capsules. The Serum is very light but so rich. I&#x27;ve used them for about 7 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face at night for 10 years and can&#x27;t be without it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin care. I recommend it</li>
            <li> these are the best ceramide capsules around...can&#x27;t live without them</li>
            <li> A great product to help keep your skin looking fresh and young. I am 74 yrs of age and have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product in a big Department store.  What a price difference.  Very pleased.  Will always buy at this site if they maintain the price point.</li>
            <li> I have used these off and on for years.  I used to work for Elizabeth Arden in a department store many years ago, and used them then.  Over the years I find myself coming back to them, I feel that they really do give my skin a smoother appearance.  I especially like to use these after I use my scrub and mask, and before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product was received timely and is good quality.  I would be happy to order this product again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> One third the cost from Elizabeth Arden yet same product !!  My skin is  very dry. This product seems to even out my skin. Can t live without it !</li>
            <li> These are the older model caps. I do not know if the newer ones are better, although I have purchases and used them too, but these are an excellent price. The newer caps are easier to open and the product is less viscose.&lt;br /&gt;Both provide excellent moisture which is completely hypo allergenic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It is definitely a great deal. I feel my skin is smoother and has a healthier glow. If you use it EVERY night religiously, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to all women.  Skin seems considerably smoother.  I notice the difference of fewer visible fine lines.</li>
            <li> This the real thing.  Glad to still see it available.  Great idea to stock while still availblle.&lt;br /&gt;Just as good as the new ceramide capsules</li>
            <li> This stuff is great will order agin for sure.  I can tell a difference in my skin already.  Telling others</li>
            <li> Product was expired when received. But seemed fine.I purchased them over 1 yr old. Just now writing the review.  When I bought them they didn&#x27;t state they were exPires as the ad does now.</li>
            <li> I use it daily. Good timing!</li>
            <li> I use these whenever I want moisturizer but no sun screen, on airplanes, and sometimes on my nails. They are really easy to carry since each one is a self-contained application. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Introduced by way of a gift and have used it consistently ever since.  Would recommend it x 100 times over.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received this product because the date on the product was over a year old - cosmetics have a shelf life of 1 year.  Will go thru another site when I buy this again.</li>
            <li> My Mom has been using these capsules since ever I can remember.  Got this for her and was a little doubtful because had never seen the packaging like this and the price was absolutely remarkable!  Turns out, it is the newest, latest packaging and my Mom went gaga over it - it&#x27;s the same product she&#x27;s been using so that was an amazing purchase - hope it stays around!</li>
            <li> i got them for  my mom for christmas, she has been using these for years and her skin is so soft and unwrinkled</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years but is getting hard to find in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Am glad to have found it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Very light texture but fantastic results</li>
            <li> good product will order again in future.</li>
