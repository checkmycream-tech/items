            <li>I tried washing it once and wasn&#x27;t too happy with how it looked after.</li>
            <li>lol :p</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>This reaally minimizes creases of foundation under ur eyes, and creates a flawless finish better than my $32 sephora 55 airbrush brush.  </li>
            <li>This brand is excellent and I love it</li>
            <li>I like the color just because its bright.</li>
            <li>After all the great reviews on this brush I was expecting an amazing brush.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as MAC or sigma.  </li>
            <li>and it does a good job..</li>
            <li>I like this brush, it is good for foundation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best to invest in a good brush.  </li>
            <li>Then I loved it..</li>
            <li>I got this hoping it would be as good as the others.....</li>
            <li>and I knew I needed a good quality brush to achieve this makeup look.</li>
            <li>ok lol.</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right amount of product and blends to a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>Love BD brushes!</li>
            <li>I use this brush on myself and clients and I love it!</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased!</li>
            <li>I use it to stipple on my NYX cream blush and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>For the purposes I use it for, I am absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li>It gives your face a nice glowing finish.</li>
            <li>All of the bdellium brushes I own are from the studio line and for all of them I purchased duplicates</li>
            <li>tried it with my Laura Mercier silk creme foundation and it was sooooo nice.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really nice.  </li>
            <li>And after I started using a popular brand of makeup brush cleaner, the problem escalated.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to pricier ones, but I liked it...</li>
            <li>I use it for my liquid foundation and it always blends nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice alternative at a cheaper price point,</li>
            <li>Good thing it was $10 when I bought it, or else I would have been much more upset.</li>
            <li>Excellent blush brush, very soft and feels nice when applying the blush.</li>
            <li>Soft and blends liquid make-up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Softer than most stippling brushes but equally effective.  </li>
            <li>right lol.</li>
            <li>Very soft very easy on the face and does my face very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the absolute best quality, but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because this is a major steal for the almost* great quality.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Better than spending tons of money on one from MAC or somewhere.</li>
            <li>However, I am absolutely satisfied using the brush to buff out my foundation after it is applied</li>
            <li>I bought this brush instead of shelling out more money for the Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>Great for blending foundation, which is all I am really using this one for.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MAKEUP</li>
            <li>THAT COSTS MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF SHOES</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE KEEPING UP WITH FASHION.</li>
            <li>I purchased several of the bdellium tools after seeing great reviews on youtube, and trust me you won&#x27;t be dissappointed!  </li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing more from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush, for the great price, really works.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found it because others are really pricey.  </li>
            <li>I have MAC brushes that shed more than this one does.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about, so I settled on this one based on price and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price this is a sure winner.</li>
            <li>Love this Line and Will Suggest any of them</li>
            <li>though I know for a fact that it is 50 times better than the Sigma Cosmetic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Bdellium does okay at it,</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it</li>
            <li>fiber finished brush-- Sephora&#x27;s brush sheds 100% more than Bdellium and Bdellium&#x27;s brush works just as well as the $35/$40</li>
            <li>But I decided to try with a brush and the overall coverage and look of the makeup with this brush is great!</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I will be more hesitant in buying them.</li>
            <li>This brush could be used for many things, you could also use it for blush.  </li>
            <li>I have many Bdellium brushes and they are usually top notch.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush for my liquid foundaion.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more...</li>
            <li>This brush is ok.  </li>
            <li>This brush blends so smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for people with sensitive skin as they have been treated with some type of anti-bacterial technology, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about shedding!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this brush to come in the mail.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush to use with makeup of special effect makeup.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and work perfectly to blend my liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>I used the flat top Kabuki for my foundation and then the duo fibre brush for my finishing powder!!!</li>
            <li>good first</li>
            <li>the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to use it, if the bristles were a tad shorter it would be perfect but the bristles are way to long  </li>
            <li>I like that it is like a kabuki brush, but with a longer, more easily manageable handle.  </li>
            <li>I love it because its soft and great for stippling on liquid foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>which makes it excellent for applying loose powders/mineral foundations, mineralize skin finishes, and powder and mineral blushes.</li>
            <li>I actually read very good reviews on this product before buying it</li>
            <li>As a powder brush, it might be worthwhile, but for liquid foundations, I&#x27;d call it average at best, and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother trying it with creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i got it because it was so so cheap and ended up being one of my favorite) and</li>
            <li>I have cheap dollar store brushes that are better than this one.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure on how to clean it though.</li>
            <li>I wear full coverage foundation and needed something that was a bit more dense than this brush.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried mac stipling brush, so i can&#x27;t compare, but i think it&#x27;s great that you won&#x27;t need a better quality brush than this if you are not a professional makeup</li>
            <li>My foundation looks flawless because of this brush, I also use less foundation than I used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone who wears mineral makeup would also find this brush useful for many purposes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was cheap introduction to stippling brushes, and I do plan to keep using the stippling technique.</li>
            <li>I blame the cheap brush for that, not the high-quality cleaner.</li>
            <li>The make up went on ultra smooth and created a halo effect, like airbrushing does.</li>
            <li>A stipple brush is an excellent way of applying a heavily pigmented blush.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I gave one as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft and does a good job with applying my face powder</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good brush, but I find it sheds a bit more than I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more Bdellium brushes I find the entire brand to be just as good as MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>fast shipping though!!!</li>
            <li>Id say this brush works best for liquid foundation.@just past the foundation all over ur face and hold the end of the brush so that u can lightly blend in the foundation.</li>
            <li>As others have said, it works just as well as some high end brushes I own.</li>
            <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
            <li>packaging was perfect, it came in a small box (not a bag;</li>
            <li>Ok price, 4 stars cuz the first one I received was defective.</li>
            <li>But there is a significant amount of bristle fall out.</li>
            <li>Not bad, it cleans easily with warm water and soap or conditioner to keep the hairs soft.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice weight and the brush hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping btw!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the brush is really nice quality, and the top white part is super</li>
            <li>I have been using the bare minerals line of foundation and brushes since 2003, and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how nice this brush is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before and found the application of make up to give a full coverage.</li>
            <li>The makeup stays on longer than it did when I used my fingers to apply it, and it does indeed provide full matte coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just the first couple uses, its been fine since.</li>
            <li>it in the mail super quick like in 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better than most regular blush brushes.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice smooth and equal coverage/finish.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to get a flawless full coverage look without looking over done or fake.</li>
            <li>i also found that this brush is easy to deep clean but not so easy to spot clean.</li>
            <li>You always want to give them a good wash and rinse and let them air dry before using them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny and it DOES NOT shed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it ocassionally sheds but it is a pretty good brush for its price.</li>
            <li>and I love the coverage and the stippling action!</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for the price and even a little better.  </li>
            <li>worth your $10.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, dries nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li>It is really soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>i think the brush would be ok to go in an artist&#x27;s kit because the client/model would feel like she&#x27;s getting pampered, with how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li>but I did not get the soft airbrushed look that some better stippling brushes can master.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bdellium brush hairs are not placed firmly enough to effectively control the application of cream color.</li>
            <li>Using the little brush sleeves totally gave it its perfect</li>
            <li>I would defiantly buy again and I am not going to replace this brush with a more expensive one because this brush works great.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the brush is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its shape was kind of messed up from the packaging, which is good because I always want to try my new brushes right away--which is NOT good!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this type of brush</li>
            <li>I was so amazed how fast it got here!</li>
            <li>but it seems to have stopped doing this after the first week or two.</li>
            <li>but I enjoyed the quality of this one brush that I decided to purchase the entire 24 piece set for $133 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shape and softness that the brush came with was not maintained after the first washing.</li>
            <li>I have several brushes from this brand and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Pretty dense</li>
            <li>this brush is super duper soft!</li>
            <li>is just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>Most of the hairs and hair fragments brush away after the foundation is dry and set with powder, but not all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides using a flat head kabuki or a stippling brush makes application of liquid foundation so easy.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>soft.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s much denser than elf stipling brush</li>
            <li>much nicer quality</li>
            <li>it works very well for that.</li>
            <li>really caught my eye.  </li>
            <li>I have to do too much work to  get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>I tried applying liquid foundation, but this also took too much work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but at a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve spent more money to get a name brand brush.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>own a few of them.</li>
            <li>As far quality goes this brush is as good as any other Bdellium Tools brush; soft, sturdy and it won&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure if you like the true stippling technique, I&#x27;d definitely pick this up and try it to see if you like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm but extremely soft and can honestly compare (maybe even out match)</li>
            <li>but when it comes to this particular brush</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (feb, 2013)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For those looking for a starter set, I highly recommend getting this set.  </li>
            <li>It looked so cute with its bright yellow handle and the price was not TOO bad its actually quite affordable compared to Mac brushes, but not so cheap like an ELF brush, so I said what the heck, I&#x27;m going to buy this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush really does produce professional results.   </li>
            <li>Its soft on my skin and washes up very well</li>
            <li>For the cost of three of these cheapies, I can get the popular pro-quality brush that will last me 5+ years and won&#x27;t leave blue ink on my skin.leave blue ink on my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Finishing and Blending Face Antibacterial Makeup Brush #955 - Studio Line from Amazon a few weeks ago and I can say I LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li>SO IM ALWAYS TRYING NEW HIGH END THINGS AND LOOKING</li>
            <li>This has become a \\&quot;cant live</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think it is a soft brush and decently priced.</li>
            <li>Very soft and flexible brush.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered the brush as a foundation brush due to the reviews.</li>
            <li>I usually do not give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li>/&gt;(2)I am a stickler for clean brushes, and wash either every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>But nothing too crazy :) i use it with the balm luminizer and mac soft and gentle to give my face a light glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like picking loose synthetic hairs off my freshly made face.</li>
            <li>but this particular brush doesn´t do much difference from my other foundation brushes and it doesn´t offer much definition either</li>
            <li>I am going to use it with the new maybelline super stay foundation I bought the other day and see what it can do!</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
            <li>There is no shedding of the hairs, and the brushes are ULTRA SOFT.   </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say much about sheding or how long it will last, but it looks pretty sturdy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and it just looks so airbrushed.</li>
            <li>However, this is by far</li>
            <li>The white bristles on the top really grabs onto the powder so a little blush goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Produces small pixels/globules that are easy to blend in.  </li>
            <li>decent quality but to big for me</li>
            <li>I insist on super soft, non-shedding, non-expensive brushes for my make-up and this little gem fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>As for shedding, it&#x27;s pretty minimal.</li>
            <li>Someone who wears regular foundation may find this brush sufficient for applying makeup, but I will certainly try the #957 for my thick, full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one or two hairs shed off of it, but nothing major, and it seemed to be</li>
            <li>br /&gt;---eek major fallout.</li>
            <li>Barely sheds.</li>
            <li>I used this brush to apply the bare minerals foundation and was stunned with the result.</li>
            <li>This brush is a pretty big with a big yellow handle and duo fiber bristles, it claims to be anti bacterial, but I can&#x27;t prove that nor do I mind if it isn&#x27;t so because I disinfect/my brush regularly.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and it gives me just enough glow using my bronzer.</li>
            <li>long-wearing foundations tend to be too thick and sticky to apply smoothly with paintbrush-style brushes.</li>
            <li>(got all the heavy pink pigment out of the white top part of the bristles</li>
            <li>It sheds like crazy and does not do a good job.</li>
            <li>Yellow handle (my personal opinion), takes a little longer to clean</li>
            <li>I used to use flat foundation brushes and would waste product and also have too much on my skin looking very unnatural.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another MAC brush as long as I live.</li>
            <li>I agree with others, this is akin to other high end, way more expensive brushes.</li>

            <li> This brush is perfect for applying powder.  </li>
            <li> it is the best brush I have in my bag.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for stippling on liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> :D</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes for blush.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> My best brushes have lasted years...</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I could tell they were of good quality!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly great!  </li>
            <li> I chose this brush because the price was in my budget &amp; the reviews were wonderful.</li>
            <li> It blends very good</li>
            <li> I find the stippling effect beautiful.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s how great they are).</li>
            <li> My makeup looks as great as before</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for stippling and blending liquid foundation, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I tried washing it once and wasn&#x27;t too happy with how it looked after.</li>
            <li> lol :p</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This reaally minimizes creases of foundation under ur eyes, and creates a flawless finish better than my $32 sephora 55 airbrush brush.  </li>
            <li> This brand is excellent and I love it</li>
            <li> I like the color just because its bright.</li>
            <li> After all the great reviews on this brush I was expecting an amazing brush.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as MAC or sigma.  </li>
            <li> and it does a good job..</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it is good for foundation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best to invest in a good brush.  </li>
            <li> Then I loved it..</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would be as good as the others.....</li>
            <li> and I knew I needed a good quality brush to achieve this makeup look.</li>
            <li> ok lol.</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right amount of product and blends to a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Love BD brushes!</li>
            <li> I use this brush on myself and clients and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased!</li>
            <li> I use it to stipple on my NYX cream blush and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> For the purposes I use it for, I am absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li> It gives your face a nice glowing finish.</li>
            <li> All of the bdellium brushes I own are from the studio line and for all of them I purchased duplicates</li>
            <li> tried it with my Laura Mercier silk creme foundation and it was sooooo nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice.  </li>
            <li> And after I started using a popular brand of makeup brush cleaner, the problem escalated.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to pricier ones, but I liked it...</li>
            <li> I use it for my liquid foundation and it always blends nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice alternative at a cheaper price point,</li>
            <li> Good thing it was $10 when I bought it, or else I would have been much more upset.</li>
            <li> Excellent blush brush, very soft and feels nice when applying the blush.</li>
            <li> Soft and blends liquid make-up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Softer than most stippling brushes but equally effective.  </li>
            <li> right lol.</li>
            <li> Very soft very easy on the face and does my face very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the absolute best quality, but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because this is a major steal for the almost* great quality.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Better than spending tons of money on one from MAC or somewhere.</li>
            <li> However, I am absolutely satisfied using the brush to buff out my foundation after it is applied</li>
            <li> I bought this brush instead of shelling out more money for the Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> Great for blending foundation, which is all I am really using this one for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MAKEUP</li>
            <li> THAT COSTS MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF SHOES</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE KEEPING UP WITH FASHION.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of the bdellium tools after seeing great reviews on youtube, and trust me you won&#x27;t be dissappointed!  </li>
            <li> I look forward to purchasing more from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush, for the great price, really works.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found it because others are really pricey.  </li>
            <li> I have MAC brushes that shed more than this one does.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about, so I settled on this one based on price and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price this is a sure winner.</li>
            <li> Love this Line and Will Suggest any of them</li>
            <li> though I know for a fact that it is 50 times better than the Sigma Cosmetic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Bdellium does okay at it,</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it</li>
            <li> fiber finished brush-- Sephora&#x27;s brush sheds 100% more than Bdellium and Bdellium&#x27;s brush works just as well as the $35/$40</li>
            <li> But I decided to try with a brush and the overall coverage and look of the makeup with this brush is great!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I will be more hesitant in buying them.</li>
            <li> This brush could be used for many things, you could also use it for blush.  </li>
            <li> I have many Bdellium brushes and they are usually top notch.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush for my liquid foundaion.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more...</li>
            <li> This brush is ok.  </li>
            <li> This brush blends so smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for people with sensitive skin as they have been treated with some type of anti-bacterial technology, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about shedding!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this brush to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush to use with makeup of special effect makeup.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and work perfectly to blend my liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I used the flat top Kabuki for my foundation and then the duo fibre brush for my finishing powder!!!</li>
            <li> good first</li>
            <li> the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to use it, if the bristles were a tad shorter it would be perfect but the bristles are way to long  </li>
            <li> I like that it is like a kabuki brush, but with a longer, more easily manageable handle.  </li>
            <li> I love it because its soft and great for stippling on liquid foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> which makes it excellent for applying loose powders/mineral foundations, mineralize skin finishes, and powder and mineral blushes.</li>
            <li> I actually read very good reviews on this product before buying it</li>
            <li> As a powder brush, it might be worthwhile, but for liquid foundations, I&#x27;d call it average at best, and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother trying it with creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i got it because it was so so cheap and ended up being one of my favorite) and</li>
            <li> I have cheap dollar store brushes that are better than this one.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure on how to clean it though.</li>
            <li> I wear full coverage foundation and needed something that was a bit more dense than this brush.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried mac stipling brush, so i can&#x27;t compare, but i think it&#x27;s great that you won&#x27;t need a better quality brush than this if you are not a professional makeup</li>
            <li> My foundation looks flawless because of this brush, I also use less foundation than I used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Someone who wears mineral makeup would also find this brush useful for many purposes.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was cheap introduction to stippling brushes, and I do plan to keep using the stippling technique.</li>
            <li> I blame the cheap brush for that, not the high-quality cleaner.</li>
            <li> The make up went on ultra smooth and created a halo effect, like airbrushing does.</li>
            <li> A stipple brush is an excellent way of applying a heavily pigmented blush.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I gave one as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft and does a good job with applying my face powder</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good brush, but I find it sheds a bit more than I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more Bdellium brushes I find the entire brand to be just as good as MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> fast shipping though!!!</li>
            <li> Id say this brush works best for liquid foundation.@just past the foundation all over ur face and hold the end of the brush so that u can lightly blend in the foundation.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it works just as well as some high end brushes I own.</li>
            <li> They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
            <li> packaging was perfect, it came in a small box (not a bag;</li>
            <li> Ok price, 4 stars cuz the first one I received was defective.</li>
            <li> But there is a significant amount of bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> Not bad, it cleans easily with warm water and soap or conditioner to keep the hairs soft.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice weight and the brush hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping btw!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the brush is really nice quality, and the top white part is super</li>
            <li> I have been using the bare minerals line of foundation and brushes since 2003, and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how nice this brush is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before and found the application of make up to give a full coverage.</li>
            <li> The makeup stays on longer than it did when I used my fingers to apply it, and it does indeed provide full matte coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just the first couple uses, its been fine since.</li>
            <li> it in the mail super quick like in 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works better than most regular blush brushes.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice smooth and equal coverage/finish.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to get a flawless full coverage look without looking over done or fake.</li>
            <li> i also found that this brush is easy to deep clean but not so easy to spot clean.</li>
            <li> You always want to give them a good wash and rinse and let them air dry before using them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny and it DOES NOT shed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it ocassionally sheds but it is a pretty good brush for its price.</li>
            <li> and I love the coverage and the stippling action!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for the price and even a little better.  </li>
            <li> worth your $10.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, dries nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li> It is really soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> i think the brush would be ok to go in an artist&#x27;s kit because the client/model would feel like she&#x27;s getting pampered, with how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li> but I did not get the soft airbrushed look that some better stippling brushes can master.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bdellium brush hairs are not placed firmly enough to effectively control the application of cream color.</li>
            <li> Using the little brush sleeves totally gave it its perfect</li>
            <li> I would defiantly buy again and I am not going to replace this brush with a more expensive one because this brush works great.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the brush is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Its shape was kind of messed up from the packaging, which is good because I always want to try my new brushes right away--which is NOT good!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this type of brush</li>
            <li> I was so amazed how fast it got here!</li>
            <li> but it seems to have stopped doing this after the first week or two.</li>
            <li> but I enjoyed the quality of this one brush that I decided to purchase the entire 24 piece set for $133 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shape and softness that the brush came with was not maintained after the first washing.</li>
            <li> I have several brushes from this brand and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Pretty dense</li>
            <li> this brush is super duper soft!</li>
            <li> is just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> Most of the hairs and hair fragments brush away after the foundation is dry and set with powder, but not all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides using a flat head kabuki or a stippling brush makes application of liquid foundation so easy.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s much denser than elf stipling brush</li>
            <li> much nicer quality</li>
            <li> it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> really caught my eye.  </li>
            <li> I have to do too much work to  get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I tried applying liquid foundation, but this also took too much work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve spent more money to get a name brand brush.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> own a few of them.</li>
            <li> As far quality goes this brush is as good as any other Bdellium Tools brush; soft, sturdy and it won&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure if you like the true stippling technique, I&#x27;d definitely pick this up and try it to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm but extremely soft and can honestly compare (maybe even out match)</li>
            <li> but when it comes to this particular brush</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (feb, 2013)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a starter set, I highly recommend getting this set.  </li>
            <li> It looked so cute with its bright yellow handle and the price was not TOO bad its actually quite affordable compared to Mac brushes, but not so cheap like an ELF brush, so I said what the heck, I&#x27;m going to buy this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush really does produce professional results.   </li>
            <li> Its soft on my skin and washes up very well</li>
            <li> For the cost of three of these cheapies, I can get the popular pro-quality brush that will last me 5+ years and won&#x27;t leave blue ink on my skin.leave blue ink on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Finishing and Blending Face Antibacterial Makeup Brush #955 - Studio Line from Amazon a few weeks ago and I can say I LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li> SO IM ALWAYS TRYING NEW HIGH END THINGS AND LOOKING</li>
            <li> This has become a \\&quot;cant live</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think it is a soft brush and decently priced.</li>
            <li> Very soft and flexible brush.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered the brush as a foundation brush due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I usually do not give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li> /&gt;(2)I am a stickler for clean brushes, and wash either every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> But nothing too crazy :) i use it with the balm luminizer and mac soft and gentle to give my face a light glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like picking loose synthetic hairs off my freshly made face.</li>
            <li> but this particular brush doesn´t do much difference from my other foundation brushes and it doesn´t offer much definition either</li>
            <li> I am going to use it with the new maybelline super stay foundation I bought the other day and see what it can do!</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
            <li> There is no shedding of the hairs, and the brushes are ULTRA SOFT.   </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say much about sheding or how long it will last, but it looks pretty sturdy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and it just looks so airbrushed.</li>
            <li> However, this is by far</li>
            <li> The white bristles on the top really grabs onto the powder so a little blush goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Produces small pixels/globules that are easy to blend in.  </li>
            <li> decent quality but to big for me</li>
            <li> I insist on super soft, non-shedding, non-expensive brushes for my make-up and this little gem fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> As for shedding, it&#x27;s pretty minimal.</li>
            <li> Someone who wears regular foundation may find this brush sufficient for applying makeup, but I will certainly try the #957 for my thick, full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one or two hairs shed off of it, but nothing major, and it seemed to be</li>
            <li> br /&gt;---eek major fallout.</li>
            <li> Barely sheds.</li>
            <li> I used this brush to apply the bare minerals foundation and was stunned with the result.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pretty big with a big yellow handle and duo fiber bristles, it claims to be anti bacterial, but I can&#x27;t prove that nor do I mind if it isn&#x27;t so because I disinfect/my brush regularly.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and it gives me just enough glow using my bronzer.</li>
            <li> long-wearing foundations tend to be too thick and sticky to apply smoothly with paintbrush-style brushes.</li>
            <li> (got all the heavy pink pigment out of the white top part of the bristles</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy and does not do a good job.</li>
            <li> Yellow handle (my personal opinion), takes a little longer to clean</li>
            <li> I used to use flat foundation brushes and would waste product and also have too much on my skin looking very unnatural.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another MAC brush as long as I live.</li>
            <li> I agree with others, this is akin to other high end, way more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own any expensive brushes but with this I don&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m your traditional black brush professional</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t used this one as i find myself using the flat square one - which gives an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li> The brush shape has changed and the bristles have splayed out and gotten more stiff, yet still too weak to pick-up color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bare minerals brushes did shed a lot and feel very rough in comparison to this one.   </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to buy these than any of the other expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as expensive as my 54 piece MAC brush set (built over the course of a few years) which can easily dwell within the range of $2K-$5.3K.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap but looks really expensive.</li>
            <li> All of the blending brushes on makeup websites were either too expensive or too cheaply put</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark bluish/black that keeps coming back to the brush even after washing it out numerous times.  </li>
            <li> Soft but firm,</li>
            <li> I have never really used liquid foundation until just recently I tried it and just used my finger.</li>
            <li> and this is nothing less than a 4 times more expensive Mac.</li>
            <li> brush was so much bigger than I expected, I actually giggled a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product was an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; deal, but with the first several uses, the hair from the brush falls off, and is quite frustrating trying to get them off your face with the foundation keeping the hair down.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but, its pretty disappointing thats it is shedding</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna take me a little while to get used to the yellow handles</li>
            <li> I have one expensive brush that I splurged on whenmy sister got married 19 years ago!</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a smaller one with a green handle and bristles)</li>
            <li> The #955 Finishing and Blending brush is a must have .... if you are tired of buying high end brushes this is your must have if your on a budget like me</li>
            <li> I also noticed I used A LOT less product, it is loose mineral powder and when I tapped the brush the excess came off in the cap.</li>
            <li> i have benn through SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many brushes and this one leaves streaks :(</li>
            <li> I have tossed the other brush I used before getting this one.  </li>
            <li> Need to purchase other brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave streaking too bad and just leaves a smooth glowy finish.</li>
            <li> Long-wearing foundation is thick and sticky, so not only do the hairs come out of the brush, but they attach themselves to my face and embed themselves in my makeup.</li>
            <li> It does not lay down color</li>
            <li> try other brushes from this line!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a blending/stippling brush for months, and couldn&#x27;t settle on a product due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t justify the price!</li>
            <li> and I immediately  had black hair all over.  </li>
            <li> The black dye will not stop bleeding.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very loose and the stick was loose and shaky.</li>
            <li> But when you wash it, it sheds and a little black coloring from the black strands comes out!  </li>
            <li> The breakage and shedding only got worse with continued use.</li>
            <li> the spray brush cleaner seems to just get wasted in the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy liquid makeup user and the thought of an anti-bacterial brush</li>
            <li> I use Nars powder blushes, and they are all heavily pigmented.</li>
            <li> I just had to wait til it dried for about a day or so.</li>
            <li> w/ very little effort.)  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when I bought this brush.</li>
            <li> but this one is a hassle for small to reach areas like around my nostrils or around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Even worse, the color started coming off the black bristles, which made the brush leave a gray-blue on the paper towel and on my skin.</li>
            <li> My other brushes (Mac, Shu Uemura, Hourglass, Urban Decay, etc) hold up well after repeated washing, so I&#x27;m disappointed that this one does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly use the brush because of these issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes it flimsy which makes it hard to control it</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any shedding.  </li>
            <li> But some of the hairs keeps falling out and sticking to my face, which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> If I did not already have other brushes from this brand I would automatically assume they are all bad.  </li>
            <li> Or I could be doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> I am a MAC girl thru and thru but brushes are incredibly expensive and I wanted to try this type of brush out before I bought a really expensive one.</li>
            <li> The bristles are scratchier than those in nicer-quality brushes (which makes this brush uncomfortable to use around the eyes and nose), and they shed and break like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it isn&#x27;t a horrible brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> the bristles make spot cleaning difficult because they travel every which way and</li>
            <li> It is mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it has remain in my brush holder unused, so sad.</li>
            <li> I also found that it sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> find that the bristles come off as I stipple across my face which makes for bad clean-up afterward.</li>
            <li> so not that bad.</li>
            <li> really disappointed</li>
            <li> le da un acabado genial a la base (</li>
            <li> but after I used this brush I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappointed when i received it.</li>
            <li> Now I hate it!!...</li>
            <li> the worst make-up brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> They get stuck in my foundation its awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was surprised by how nice this brush is. The handle has a nice weight and the brush hairs are very soft. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before and found the application of make up to give a full coverage. Or I could be doing it wrong? Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. Better than spending tons of money on one from MAC or somewhere.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for a brush set. It put on perfect foundation every time. Barely sheds. This has become a \\&quot;cant live without\\&quot; item!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the brush as a foundation brush due to the reviews. I probably should have went with the #957 for that purpose, considering my situation. I wear full coverage foundation and needed something that was a bit more dense than this brush. However, I am absolutely satisfied using the brush to buff out my foundation after it is applied and/or applying setting powder with it. Someone who wears regular foundation may find this brush sufficient for applying makeup, but I will certainly try the #957 for my thick, full coverage foundation. For the purposes I use it for, I am absolutely thrilled. It applies my setting powder flawlessly. Someone who wears mineral makeup would also find this brush useful for many purposes.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush is awesome! It&#x27;s cheap but looks really expensive. It gives your face a nice glowing finish.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush instead of shelling out more money for the Sigma brush. It is great!! I use it for liquid foundation and it goes on flawlessly. As for shedding, it&#x27;s pretty minimal. I use the brush daily and it sheds maybe 1 hair once a week maybe. For the price, it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> This is def. worth your $10. As others have said, it works just as well as some high end brushes I own. Great for blending foundation, which is all I am really using this one for. I&#x27;ve had one or two hairs shed off of it, but nothing major, and it seemed to be just the first couple uses, its been fine since. Easy to clean, dries nice and fluffy. I would def. try other brushes from this line!</li>
            <li> I used a Mac 187 and this is nothing less than a 4 times more expensive Mac. Very happy with it, I would def recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love BD brushes! own a few of them. I still haven&#x27;t used this one as i find myself using the flat square one - which gives an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MAKEUP SO IM ALWAYS TRYING NEW HIGH END THINGS AND LOOKING THESE BEAT ALOT OF BRUSHES OUT THERE THAT COSTS MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF SHOES I USE TOO MODEL AND I LOVE KEEPING UP WITH FASHION.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of the bdellium tools after seeing great reviews on youtube, and trust me you won&#x27;t be dissappointed!  I also have several MAC brushes and the quality is just as good if not better.  All of the bdellium brushes I own are from the studio line and for all of them I purchased duplicates (that&#x27;s how great they are). I currently have the 774, 777,781, 953, 955, and the 963.  Today I ordered the 708, 763, and the 980.  These brushes are great for people with sensitive skin as they have been treated with some type of anti-bacterial technology, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about shedding!!!</li>
            <li> This product sat in my wish list for about a month, then in my cart for about a week or two. It looked so cute with its bright yellow handle and the price was not TOO bad its actually quite affordable compared to Mac brushes, but not so cheap like an ELF brush, so I said what the heck, I&#x27;m going to buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even read the reviews or anything!!!&lt;br /&gt;Got it in the mail super quick like in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was perfect, it came in a small box (not a bag; good first impression).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was so much bigger than I expected, I actually giggled a little bit. Its shape was kind of messed up from the packaging, which is good because I always want to try my new brushes right away--which is NOT good! You always want to give them a good wash and rinse and let them air dry before using them. Using the little brush sleeves totally gave it its perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention, its ACTUALLY a duo fibre brush its not one that has only the tips painted white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with my Laura Mercier silk creme foundation and it was sooooo nice. I am going to use it with the new maybelline super stay foundation I bought the other day and see what it can do! I def recommend! I look forward to purchasing more from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months later&lt;br /&gt;---eek major fallout. still applies like a charm though.</li>
            <li> This product was an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; deal, but with the first several uses, the hair from the brush falls off, and is quite frustrating trying to get them off your face with the foundation keeping the hair down.</li>
            <li> Soft and blends liquid make-up perfectly.  Easy to clean and I have not experienced any shedding.  I agree with others, this is akin to other high end, way more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush, for the great price, really works.  It is just as good as MAC or sigma.  I am so happy that I found it because others are really pricey.  It is really soft and easy to clean.  My makeup looks as great as before</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I purchased this product. I am a MAC girl thru and thru but brushes are incredibly expensive and I wanted to try this type of brush out before I bought a really expensive one. It was much bigger than I anticipated. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect. The bristles are nice and soft, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny and it DOES NOT shed. I have MAC brushes that shed more than this one does. I usually do not give anything 5 stars but this product deserves it. I would defiantly buy again and I am not going to replace this brush with a more expensive one because this brush works great.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I actual stipple with this stippling brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the bristles come off as I stipple across my face which makes for bad clean-up afterward. I don&#x27;t like picking loose synthetic hairs off my freshly made face. Otherwise, I think it is a soft brush and decently priced. If you&#x27;re unsure if you like the true stippling technique, I&#x27;d definitely pick this up and try it to see if you like it. Low price commitment (unlike MAC!).</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying powder.  It picks up just the right amount of product and blends to a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a blending/stippling brush for months, and couldn&#x27;t settle on a product due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t justify the price! All of the blending brushes on makeup websites were either too expensive or too cheaply put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this brush! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush specifically to use with a long-wearing liquid foundation. I wanted fuller coverage and a matte finish that I just couldn&#x27;t get from my fingers, and long-wearing foundations tend to be too thick and sticky to apply smoothly with paintbrush-style brushes. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for a brush I wasn&#x27;t sure about, so I settled on this one based on price and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the stippling technique to apply my makeup with this brush. The makeup stays on longer than it did when I used my fingers to apply it, and it does indeed provide full matte coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush isn&#x27;t without its flaws. The bristles are scratchier than those in nicer-quality brushes (which makes this brush uncomfortable to use around the eyes and nose), and they shed and break like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shedding is problematic. Long-wearing foundation is thick and sticky, so not only do the hairs come out of the brush, but they attach themselves to my face and embed themselves in my makeup. Most of the hairs and hair fragments brush away after the foundation is dry and set with powder, but not all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was cheap introduction to stippling brushes, and I do plan to keep using the stippling technique. Overall, it isn&#x27;t a horrible brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  As a powder brush, it might be worthwhile, but for liquid foundations, I&#x27;d call it average at best, and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother trying it with creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I continued using this brush after I posted my initial review. The breakage and shedding only got worse with continued use. And after I started using a popular brand of makeup brush cleaner, the problem escalated. Even worse, the color started coming off the black bristles, which made the brush leave a gray-blue on the paper towel and on my skin. I blame the cheap brush for that, not the high-quality cleaner. I tossed this brush. For the cost of three of these cheapies, I can get the popular pro-quality brush that will last me 5+ years and won&#x27;t leave blue ink on my skin.leave blue ink on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when I bought this brush. I have been using the bare minerals line of foundation and brushes since 2003, and have been very pleased. I used this brush to apply the bare minerals foundation and was stunned with the result. The make up went on ultra smooth and created a halo effect, like airbrushing does. This brush really does produce professional results.   There is no shedding of the hairs, and the brushes are ULTRA SOFT.   My bare minerals brushes did shed a lot and feel very rough in comparison to this one.   For the price this is a sure winner.</li>
            <li> I am a MUA and this is a must have brush. I love it because its soft and great for stippling on liquid foundation evenly. I doesn&#x27;t shead even after washing. I like the color just because its bright.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for stippling and blending liquid foundation, and it worked great.  An occasional shed hair here or there but whatever.  This was my first time using this type of brush so I can&#x27;t compare it to pricier ones, but I liked it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this brush 5 stars, but after a month of daily use and washing, what I can only assume is dye started leaching out of the brush (and onto my face!).  It&#x27;s a dark bluish/black that keeps coming back to the brush even after washing it out numerous times.  I probably washed it 50 times and the dye wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I finally gave up and bought a sonia kashuk brush from target...</li>
            <li> The #955 Finishing and Blending brush is a must have .... if you are tired of buying high end brushes this is your must have if your on a budget like me this brush i have had about 3 months now and it does a good job..Very soft very easy on the face and does my face very good. i cannot purchase MAC or Sigma brushes at the moment but will try but these BD Brushes are the TRUTH!!! Love this Line and Will Suggest any of them these are a MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> this brush is super duper soft! which makes it excellent for applying loose powders/mineral foundations, mineralize skin finishes, and powder and mineral blushes. i think its probably the softest brush ive ever come across! the problem is that the instructions/caption that comes with the brush says that it can be used for liquid foundation. that is definetly a no-no! i would not use this for anything liquid. the brush is simply not sturdy enough. it cannot blend any liquid on the skin, the bristles travel in every direction and simply lack the control needed for applying liquids. i also found that this brush is easy to deep clean but not so easy to spot clean. the bristles make spot cleaning difficult because they travel every which way and the spray brush cleaner seems to just get wasted in the process. i would recommend this brush for powders only. i think the brush would be ok to go in an artist&#x27;s kit because the client/model would feel like she&#x27;s getting pampered, with how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, it&#x27;s soft and does a good job with applying my face powder and I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times for stippling my foundation.  But when you wash it, it sheds and a little black coloring from the black strands comes out!  So the hairs of the brush are dyed, oh well.</li>
            <li> i ordered this last night and got it this morning. I was so amazed how fast it got here! so two thumbs up for that Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brush is really nice quality, and the top white part is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s much denser than elf stipling brush (i got it because it was so so cheap and ended up being one of my favorite) and much nicer quality so i think i might replace elf one with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried mac stipling brush, so i can&#x27;t compare, but i think it&#x27;s great that you won&#x27;t need a better quality brush than this if you are not a professional makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet, so i can&#x27;t say much about sheding or how long it will last, but it looks pretty sturdy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (feb, 2013): It does shed.. so i took a star away. But nothing too crazy :) i use it with the balm luminizer and mac soft and gentle to give my face a light glow. it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for the price and even a little better.  I use it for my liquid foundation and it always blends nicely.  It&#x27;s not the absolute best quality, but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because this is a major steal for the almost* great quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Finishing and Blending Face Antibacterial Makeup Brush #955 - Studio Line from Amazon a few weeks ago and I can say I LOVE this brush.  I insist on super soft, non-shedding, non-expensive brushes for my make-up and this little gem fits the bill.  I use it to stipple on my NYX cream blush and it is amazing.  I noticed 2 hairs came out the 1st time I washed, but none since.  Its soft on my skin and washes up very well (got all the heavy pink pigment out of the white top part of the bristles w/ very little effort.)  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I have never used a brush like this. It is amazing! Also synthetic which I have stayed away from.. it is the best brush I have in my bag. I use it for concealer under my eyes. It&#x27;s a must  have and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this brush to come in the mail. After all the great reviews on this brush I was expecting an amazing brush. but after I used this brush I was very disappointed. My foundation did not apply evenly and when I washed it color leaked and the white bristle turned gray. I also found that it sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> I actually read very good reviews on this product before buying it but i was very disappointed when i received it. The bristles are very loose and the stick was loose and shaky. really disappointed</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for stippling on liquid foundation. Its easy to get a flawless full coverage look without looking over done or fake. I don&#x27;t own any expensive brushes but with this I don&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> cuando compre este producto no sabia si esperar mucho o poco... me inclinaba por esperar poco para no sufrir decepciones... sin embargo despues de mas de un mes de estarlo probando puedo decir q estoy muy feliz y satisfecha con mi adquisicion... le da un acabado genial a la base (y eso era lo q precisamente yo estaba buscando), puedo echarme el rubor en crema con acabado aceptable (necesitaria una brocha mas pequeña para eso pq mi rostro no es tan grande pero me defiendo con esta)...  yo recomiendo 100% este producto, por lo menos a mi no me decepciono, supero las espectativas creadas...</li>
            <li> I like it and im not picky ok lol. i have benn through SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many brushes and this one leaves streaks :( not saying the others havent but this one is a hassle for small to reach areas like around my nostrils or around the eye area. fast shipping though!!! :D i do recommend it though for a temporary brush. decent quality but to big for me face lol :p</li>
            <li> Amazing brush to use with makeup of special effect makeup. I use this brush on myself and clients and I love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes for blush.  The white bristles on the top really grabs onto the powder so a little blush goes a long way.  You dab on the blush and then swirl to blend.  It works better than most regular blush brushes.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement (or alternative) for my Mac 187 brush. I bought this based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen around the web and gave it a shot for the price point. Overall it&#x27;s a good brush, but I find it sheds a bit more than I&#x27;d like-- but it seems to have stopped doing this after the first week or two. Nice alternative at a cheaper price point, but I think I&#x27;m going to return to my mac.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pretty big with a big yellow handle and duo fiber bristles, it claims to be anti bacterial, but I can&#x27;t prove that nor do I mind if it isn&#x27;t so because I disinfect/my brush regularly. I used this with. Bareminerals foundation and blush as well as liquid foundations and pressed blushes/bronzers. Id say this brush works best for liquid foundation.@just past the foundation all over ur face and hold the end of the brush so that u can lightly blend in the foundation. This reaally minimizes creases of foundation under ur eyes, and creates a flawless finish better than my $32 sephora 55 airbrush brush.  Ok price, 4 stars cuz the first one I received was defective.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it is good for foundation and I think that it is softer than the sonia kashuk stippling brush. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it ocassionally sheds but it is a pretty good brush for its price.</li>
            <li> Very soft and flexible brush.  Produces small pixels/globules that are easy to blend in.  Softer than most stippling brushes but equally effective.  I get a nice smooth and equal coverage/finish.  Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m your traditional black brush professional and I decided to give this foundation brush a try.  I&#x27;m a heavy liquid makeup user and the thought of an anti-bacterial brush really caught my eye.  The moment I received it, I used it almost immediately and I love the coverage and the stippling action! It&#x27;s firm but extremely soft and can honestly compare (maybe even out match) the MAC brush in both quality and usage, though I know for a fact that it is 50 times better than the Sigma Cosmetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna take me a little while to get used to the yellow handles but I enjoyed the quality of this one brush that I decided to purchase the entire 24 piece set for $133 here on Amazon. For those looking for a starter set, I highly recommend getting this set.  It&#x27;s nowhere near as expensive as my 54 piece MAC brush set (built over the course of a few years) which can easily dwell within the range of $2K-$5.3K.  So, as you can see $133 is a bargain for quality brushes AND it&#x27;s anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  Soft but firm, no shredding even with the comb test (and with washing)&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Yellow handle (my personal opinion), takes a little longer to clean</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this brush based on the reviews on Amazon. After two weeks of use, I am vastly underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush to stipple on both powder and cream  blush. I use Nars powder blushes, and they are all heavily pigmented. A stipple brush is an excellent way of applying a heavily pigmented blush. This Bdellium does okay at it, but I did not get the soft airbrushed look that some better stippling brushes can master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cream blush, I use Illamasqua or Chanel Soleil Cream Bronzer. The Bdellium brush hairs are not placed firmly enough to effectively control the application of cream color. I have to do too much work to  get the desired effect. I tried applying liquid foundation, but this also took too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash the brush after every second use, and it holds up okay. The shape and softness that the brush came with was not maintained after the first washing. My other brushes (Mac, Shu Uemura, Hourglass, Urban Decay, etc) hold up well after repeated washing, so I&#x27;m disappointed that this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with this brush shedding. It does lose a hair here and there but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have had/been using this brush for six months now. It is mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It does not lay down color that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)I am a stickler for clean brushes, and wash either every day or every other day. This brush does not hold up to repeated cleanings. The brush shape has changed and the bristles have splayed out and gotten more stiff, yet still too weak to pick-up color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hardly use the brush because of these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is just junk. The hairs separated from the ferrule in one  big clump. I have another Bdellium stippling brush (the smaller one), and the same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to invest in a good brush.  My best brushes have lasted years... I have one expensive brush that I splurged on whenmy sister got married 19 years ago!</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my birthday and I have to say I love it but everytime I use it breaks my face out in red blotches. So I don&#x27;t use it anymore. It blends very good but I think I&#x27;ll stick with my sponges!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to buy these than any of the other expensive brushes.  I&#x27;ve used Sephora&#x27;s pro stippling brush and compared to Bdellium&#x27;s 2 (there&#x27;s a smaller one with a green handle and bristles) fiber finished brush-- Sephora&#x27;s brush sheds 100% more than Bdellium and Bdellium&#x27;s brush works just as well as the $35/$40 brush&lt;br /&gt;I do use Sephora&#x27;s brush cleaner after every use  of this brush and it still hasn&#x27;t shed ONE bit...</li>
            <li> I received my brushes yesterday!! Super fast shipping btw!!! As soon as I opened the package I could tell they were of good quality!!! I used them this morning!!! They are super soft and work perfectly to blend my liquid foundation! I used the flat top Kabuki for my foundation and then the duo fibre brush for my finishing powder!!! Buy these...they are a must have. I will never buy another MAC brush as long as I live.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very big, but I like it. x x x x xc xc xc xc xc xc cx xx x</li>
            <li> I like this brush for blending in my foundation. I have never really used liquid foundation until just recently I tried it and just used my finger. But I decided to try with a brush and the overall coverage and look of the makeup with this brush is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave streaking too bad and just leaves a smooth glowy finish. I&#x27;m not too sure on how to clean it though. I tried washing it once and wasn&#x27;t too happy with how it looked after. I just had to wait til it dried for about a day or so.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! It is so soft and it gives me just enough glow using my bronzer. It is not heavy and it just looks so airbrushed. I also noticed I used A LOT less product, it is loose mineral powder and when I tapped the brush the excess came off in the cap. Perfect! Antibacterial is an added benefit, all my brushes are antibacterial now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago...Then I loved it..Now I hate it!!...Now it leaves hair on my face!!...I lay my brush for a minute and hairs are everywhere!!!...Unless I just got a defective brush I DO NOT recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I have several brushes from this brand and absolutely love them. I got this hoping it would be as good as the others.....it&#x27;s not.  I have cheap dollar store brushes that are better than this one. I put it to my face and I immediately  had black hair all over.  It sheds like crazy and does not do a good job. If I did not already have other brushes from this brand I would automatically assume they are all bad.  I know that they aren&#x27;t but I will be more hesitant in buying them.</li>
            <li> This brand is excellent and I love it but this particular brush doesn´t do much difference from my other foundation brushes and it doesn´t offer much definition either</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely wonderful!  I use it to blend my foundation and if i contour i use it for that as well.  This brush could be used for many things, you could also use it for blush.  It works amazingly great!  The bristles are soft and the brush is really easy to use.  I&#x27;ve been told this could compare to the mac version of this brush...but at a much cheaper price.  I hope Bdellium keeps their low prices.</li>
            <li> I have many Bdellium brushes and they are usually top notch.  However, this is by far the worst make-up brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The black dye will not stop bleeding.  i keep washing and drying and washing and drying the brush but it the dye will not stop bleeding.  It&#x27;s been 3 months and there is no sign this will stop.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t shed.  I have tossed the other brush I used before getting this one.  I like that it is like a kabuki brush, but with a longer, more easily manageable handle.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. I use it for application of BB cream and pigmented blushes. I find the stippling effect beautiful. The brush is perfection!!! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Excellent blush brush, very soft and feels nice when applying the blush. I liked it so much that I gave one as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only twice and its lost a lot of bristles. They get stuck in my foundation its awful. The brush is soft but, its pretty disappointing thats it is shedding and I literally just started to use it.</li>
            <li> This does the job. I&#x27;ve had it for years, and it applies makeup evenly. But there is a significant amount of bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> I used to use flat foundation brushes and would waste product and also have too much on my skin looking very unnatural. My foundation looks flawless because of this brush, I also use less foundation than I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll be purchasing more Bdellium brushes I find the entire brand to be just as good as MAC brushes. I have had this brush for two years now and its only shed two hairs!! I guess one hair for each year right lol. Not bad, it cleans easily with warm water and soap or conditioner to keep the hairs soft.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush for my liquid foundaion. Besides using a flat head kabuki or a stippling brush makes application of liquid foundation so easy. Need to purchase other brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> It buffs and blends as I want it to, but it sheds A LOT. My Sonia kashuk stippling brush works just as well but never sheds. Good thing it was $10 when I bought it, or else I would have been much more upset. But for the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more... I would not recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok.  But some of the hairs keeps falling out and sticking to my face, which is frustrating.  I guess I should&#x27;ve spent more money to get a name brand brush.</li>
            <li> As far quality goes this brush is as good as any other Bdellium Tools brush; soft, sturdy and it won&#x27;t shed at all and that is why I gave it four stars but when it comes to this particular brush the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to use it, if the bristles were a tad shorter it would be perfect but the bristles are way to long  and it makes it flimsy which makes it hard to control it, I planned to use it for blush but it makes my blush get all over the place so it has remain in my brush holder unused, so sad.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive. Pretty dense so not that bad. i do use it constantly for foundation. BUT IT SHEDS!!! keep that in mind</li>
            <li> I have just started to learn to highlight &amp; contour and I knew I needed a good quality brush to achieve this makeup look. I chose this brush because the price was in my budget &amp; the reviews were wonderful. This brush blends so smoothly and evenly! I am 100% pleased! Thank you!</li>
