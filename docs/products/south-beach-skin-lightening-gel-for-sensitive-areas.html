            <li>I purchased another product which contained 2% hydroquinone and have the results I wanted within 4 weeks; perhaps a bit risky, but I am fine - experienced no hyper-pigmentation, no irritation...    </li>
            <li>but it was really amazing..</li>
            <li>This product is amazing ...</li>

            <li>Really satisfied, does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works great for me, my sensitive areas is lighten up, better than before, Much better !!</li>
            <li>I put it to light the skin</li>
            <li>I have used mine for 4 weeks and have seen a great amount of lightening (and even forgot to use it some days or only used once a day).</li>
            <li>I researched lightening products for sensitive areas and decided on south beach because of the lack of harmful ingredients, and because a popular day spa in my town that I love uses it.</li>
            <li>Its been a month straight using this product and I have seen no results and I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li>THAT A HIGHER PRICE PRODUCT WOULD WORK BETTER...</li>
            <li>This isnot a quick fix, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>noticed fast fantastic result in no time!</li>
            <li>the specifications of the product is the same and the features are excellents, It is a good election to purchase.</li>
            <li>&quot; IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE.</li>
            <li>it will finish quickly as you have to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I never used it for a month straight only a week overnight every night with great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and gentle</li>
            <li>So far I have been applying this product twice daily for 3 weeks, and I must admit I have noticed great improvement.  </li>
            <li>This was my experience, and has been very positive.</li>
            <li>It will probably last for 2 more months, so its worth buying for 4 months use.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to buy my second order :)</li>
            <li>You will see the results the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>It worked that fast!</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for about 2 months or so, I started to see a bit of lightening.</li>
            <li>I used this product on the first day I received it--only one application.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not shy about stating the product contains no kojic acid or hydoquinone, but they&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so I can test it on my skin first.</li>
            <li>thanks very much</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see any positive results in 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>I bought this almost a year ago, and used it consistently for 8 whole months.</li>
            <li>I make sure its really dry.</li>
            <li>The South Beach gel is very pricy and reads full of promise without harmful ingredients, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me; perhaps you will have more patience and use all of the product before labeling it a \\&quot;waste of money\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that I received the product quickly, within a few days of my order.</li>
            <li>i have very senstive skin and was worried in using this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell a real difference.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;whitening\\&quot;, so it doesn&#x27;t really make any sense its purchase.</li>
            <li>I used it about 6 weeks and didn&#x27;t see much change in skin tone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much each time.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>That really make her very happry</li>
            <li>Thank you for this product her self esteem has really picked up.</li>
            <li>, I suggest waxing because shaving cause more dark on your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to use it for more than two months to start seeing results, I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and it&#x27;s all starting to lighten up slowly but surely .</li>
            <li>I may order another one, or try a new product.</li>
            <li>This cream does not WORK unless you are really light skin \\&quot;maybe\\&quot;, but I am Mexican American</li>
            <li>I can safely say that I&#x27;ve observed very little difference in the color of my pigmentation after all this time.</li>
            <li>I bought this from my local spa, and I must say I saw results after my first application.</li>
            <li>I only put a little but make sure its apply to where you wanna lighten up.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would advice you not to get it.  </li>
            <li>But I am convinced that professional lightening is needed to achieve that.</li>
            <li>This cream did not irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>Make sure to take pictures of your before and after to actually see results-the changes may be very slight.</li>
            <li>The tube is small only 2oz, so most likely you will need to order two.</li>
            <li>My under arm skin color/tone barely showed signs of lightening.</li>
            <li>You must use regularly, and maybe if I would have used it longer, and consistently, I would have got the pink I was going for.</li>
            <li>I was using it on my genitals to try and achieve that pink, brand new look.</li>
            <li>I had such a high hopes for this product due to all they hype.</li>

            <li> Granted I am Caucasian but after leaving it on while I slept the first night my lady area looks at least three times lighter 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this product for a long time and finally decided to order it.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on using it for a long time to keep the results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product honestly doubting it would work because of all the bad reviews I read about it, but I still went on and decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> but it has lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t require extreme lightening, and I&#x27;ve been using this several weeks now...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wait for it to dry completely, so maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work, but still I expected a little change, which I didn&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived and was not too big, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for four weeks and during the fourth week, I began to notice a slight change in the darkness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use this on my Vagina after my occasional brazilian waxes because that area is always a little bit darker than the rest of my skin, I was instructed by the esthetician to apply it and compress area with suran wrap and use it for about 30-45 min.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see all of the negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I expected.</li>
            <li> I will give it a 2...not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I only have a few spots that I wanted to take care of.</li>
            <li> but, after two weeks you really see dramatic result.</li>
            <li> I am using it on such a small area</li>
            <li> I still used it, but not consistently.</li>
            <li> she had some brown blemishing marking due to her pregnacy .</li>
            <li> What are the active ingredients?  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of lightening my dark under arms.</li>
            <li> Dont shave down there</li>
            <li> I received an empty envelope!!</li>
            <li> A WHILE NOW AND SEE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> As for the result, my skin did slightly change.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product help me reduces all the black spots  underneath my arms.</li>
            <li> Well for me, I applied to vagina, covered area in suran wrap so that it was tight on skin, and did it over night, I would wake up and remove, and my skin was brighter.</li>
            <li> I wish I would of tajen befire and after pictures for myself to see the progress because results are a little slower tuen</li>
            <li> the only negative thing will be the size of it!</li>
            <li> I applied the cream on everyday for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy this product, waste of money and time, Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Too small for the price with no results.</li>
            <li> At least I had no irritation, rash or redness in my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t quite do its job:</li>
            <li> This product did lighting up my problem areas but at a slow pace.</li>
            <li> By consistently, I mean 2 times a day; in the morning and before bed at night.</li>
            <li> Is not good</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the cream takes that long to work.</li>
            <li> WISH I WOULD OF READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I WASTED MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> The results were highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is bad quality it does not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT AND WISH I WOULD OF RETURNED IT AFTER A MONTH OF USING IT AND SEEING NO CHANGE.</li>
            <li> Terrible product !!!</li>

            <li> I did luke this product a lot. I wish I would of tajen befire and after pictures for myself to see the progress because results are a little slower tuen I expected. This product did lighting up my problem areas but at a slow pace. I been useing it for about a month now. I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am trying the south beach skin lightening gel and i must say i still have no results.  Is their another product out there to try. If so please let me know asap,my wedding is in 7 to 8 months from now and i would love to get results.Thank You Rachel</li>
            <li> I will give it a 2...not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream on everyday for 3 weeks and there&#x27;s no change. On the tube it says to wait till it dries for best results. I didn&#x27;t wait for it to dry completely, so maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work, but still I expected a little change, which I didn&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> i have very senstive skin and was worried in using this product. but it was really amazing.. just put it, finish your morning schadule then put on your clothes! noticed fast fantastic result in no time! the only negative thing will be the size of it! it will finish quickly as you have to use it twice a day. but it&#x27;s really good ,, really really good!</li>
            <li> I am underwhelmed. I don&#x27;t require extreme lightening, and I&#x27;ve been using this several weeks now... I can&#x27;t tell a real difference.</li>
            <li> I currently have two months or so using it, and see no change at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it. At least I had no irritation, rash or redness in my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t quite do its job: \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;, so it doesn&#x27;t really make any sense its purchase.</li>
            <li> the specifications of the product is the same and the features are excellents, It is a good election to purchase. thanks very much</li>
            <li> So far I have been applying this product twice daily for 3 weeks, and I must admit I have noticed great improvement.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> South Beach has some of the best products on the market, I am never disappointed when purchasing something that is made by South Beach</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for almost 2 months now and I love it, I put it on every morning and night after I shower and apply it around my vagina and anus. I only put a little but make sure its apply to where you wanna lighten up. I rub it all around for 10 seconds, wait for 5 mins before I put my underwear on. I make sure its really dry. Ive been using it for 2 months now, and I still have a lot. It will probably last for 2 more months, so its worth buying for 4 months use. I cant wait to buy my second order :) Overall, it works great for me, my sensitive areas is lighten up, better than before, Much better !! Dont shave down there, I suggest waxing because shaving cause more dark on your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost a year ago, and used it consistently for 8 whole months. By consistently, I mean 2 times a day; in the morning and before bed at night. I can safely say that I&#x27;ve observed very little difference in the color of my pigmentation after all this time. I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product. I only have a few spots that I wanted to take care of. I used the gel as prescribed for over 1 month. The results were highly disappointing. The product didn&#x27;t do anything. There was no change at all. I feel gullible for thinking this might work. Yes, I would have to say I got suckered.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I probably didn&#x27;t give this product the time needed to see results. I used it about 6 weeks and didn&#x27;t see much change in skin tone. I purchased another product which contained 2% hydroquinone and have the results I wanted within 4 weeks; perhaps a bit risky, but I am fine - experienced no hyper-pigmentation, no irritation...    The South Beach gel is very pricy and reads full of promise without harmful ingredients, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me; perhaps you will have more patience and use all of the product before labeling it a \\&quot;waste of money\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had to wait until I finish using this product to do a review. Overall results are great! I used it for my underarms and it worked like wonder. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Its been a month straight using this product and I have seen no results and I am pretty fair skinned. I will not be buying this ever again.</li>
            <li> This product works great. You definitely have to use it for more than two months to start seeing results, I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and it&#x27;s all starting to lighten up slowly but surely .</li>
            <li> I bought this from my local spa, and I must say I saw results after my first application. I use this on my Vagina after my occasional brazilian waxes because that area is always a little bit darker than the rest of my skin, I was instructed by the esthetician to apply it and compress area with suran wrap and use it for about 30-45 min. Well for me, I applied to vagina, covered area in suran wrap so that it was tight on skin, and did it over night, I would wake up and remove, and my skin was brighter. I never used it for a month straight only a week overnight every night with great results. I am about to start again because I just got another wax, so I shall see if I get the same results.</li>
            <li> Every time I used it my skin would be allergic to it.  If you have sensitive skin, I would advice you not to get it.  As for the result, my skin did slightly change.  But I wouldn&#x27;t paid for the same price to get the result I got.</li>
            <li> Terrible product !!! Don t buy it i got an allergy on my skin   I put it to light the skin and i got a terrible allergy .....horrible ..!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see all of the negative reviews for this product. I researched lightening products for sensitive areas and decided on south beach because of the lack of harmful ingredients, and because a popular day spa in my town that I love uses it. I have used mine for 4 weeks and have seen a great amount of lightening (and even forgot to use it some days or only used once a day). I also have a lot of the lotion left given I am using it on such a small area I don&#x27;t need much each time. This was my experience, and has been very positive. Only negative is the price but it has lasted a long time</li>
            <li> Too small for the price with no results.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. It is bad quality it does not work I used it for about three weeks and I did not see any results I all.</li>
            <li> Excelent product.  You will see the results the first week of use.  Total satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It delivers what it promised and stays permanent!</li>
            <li> Havent using it yet... A bit scared after reading all the review ..&lt;br /&gt;Cause i just trauma using marie france skin lightening and it was burn my skin..&lt;br /&gt;In case of using south beach i decided to use triderma cream to heal and it works...&lt;br /&gt;Maybe after my skin get better will try the south beach cream..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> the product warms up and start to burn. I don&#x27;t like it and I won&#x27;t be buying it again. thanks.</li>
            <li> I received an empty envelope!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product honestly doubting it would work because of all the bad reviews I read about it, but I still went on and decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 2 weeks morning and nights as directions advised and I could tell a my privates were a lot lighter! It worked that fast! I definitely plan on using it for a long time to keep the results! It&#x27;s so light and gentle it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way! Definitely purchasing again after I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This cream does not WORK unless you are really light skin \\&quot;maybe\\&quot;, but I am Mexican American and I tried it for 1month does not work . Im still looking for a cream .</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT THINKING THAT A HIGHER PRICE PRODUCT WOULD WORK BETTER...WELL THAT SAYING \\&quot; YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR\\&quot; IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE NOW AND SEE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE AT ALL!! I&#x27;M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT AND WISH I WOULD OF RETURNED IT AFTER A MONTH OF USING IT AND SEEING NO CHANGE. IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME....WISH I WOULD OF READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I WASTED MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy this product, waste of money and time, Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived and was not too big, but a little goes a long way. I used it consistently for about 2 months or so, I started to see a bit of lightening. I was using it on my genitals to try and achieve that pink, brand new look. But I am convinced that professional lightening is needed to achieve that. The product didn&#x27;t claim miracles. So I believe the product did what it claims. It lightens skin, gradually. You must use regularly, and maybe if I would have used it longer, and consistently, I would have got the pink I was going for. I still used it, but not consistently. This isnot a quick fix, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I used this product on the first day I received it--only one application.  The next morning I woke up and checked the patch of skin where I applied the lightening gel.  And in ONE day, it was noticeably lighter.  So happy I bought it...!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this product for a long time and finally decided to order it. I am definately seeing results,  but don&#x27;t expect to see them over night. This cream did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. Loving the results you just have to be patient.</li>
            <li> I had such a high hopes for this product due to all they hype. I didn&#x27;t work at all for me (Asian skin, used for underarm and elbow lighting).</li>
            <li> Is not good and I bought two used until the end of did not bleaching did not remove the blackness of the labia do not I advise use never these</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to everyone. It worked for me this is my second bottle. This product help me reduces all the black spots  underneath my arms.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ... Granted I am Caucasian but after leaving it on while I slept the first night my lady area looks at least three times lighter 👍</li>
            <li> What are the active ingredients?  They&#x27;re not shy about stating the product contains no kojic acid or hydoquinone, but they&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t advertise what sort of skin lightener they&#x27;re using.  I used the gel &amp; the lotion and neither of them did anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Derriere seems to work, but I&#x27;m still looking into Benoquin products and Arbutin products.  Skin Solutions company are theives.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks. Doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Using the product as directed but no results as of yet. I&#x27;Ve used the product over 1 month now. Make sure to take pictures of your before and after to actually see results-the changes may be very slight.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any positive results in 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> Really satisfied, does what its suppose to do. Started to  See result in seven days but, after two weeks you really see dramatic result. Will be ordering another one.  Great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of lightening my dark under arms. I was pleased that I received the product quickly, within a few days of my order. I applied the cream twice a day as instructed on the contents. I used the cream for four weeks and during the fourth week, I began to notice a slight change in the darkness of my skin tone. My under arm skin color/tone barely showed signs of lightening. I did not experience any kind of allergic reaction, itching or burning however I am disappointed that the cream takes that long to work. The tube is small only 2oz, so most likely you will need to order two. I started with one so I can test it on my skin first. I may order another one, or try a new product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend started using it on her face she had some brown blemishing marking due to her pregnacy . It really has been working real good for her. That really make her very happry and if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m very happy too. Thank you for this product her self esteem has really picked up. I hope people try it and see the differance it makes.Thank you once again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for four weeks and find no skin ligntening effect.  I have freckles that are still the same.</li>
