            <li> Weren&#x27;t bleached and pretty big for a small!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the product as I just have a minor gap in between my front teeth</li>

            <li> I bought it in hopes it would help hide my teeth through the next few months as I&#x27;m having some extensive dental work done.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and wear these to hide a missing front tooth.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> I tried one other set</li>
            <li> how other see it.&lt;br /&gt;Follow</li>
            <li> you are not worthy..  </li>
            <li> *** and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I waste my money for this.</li>
            <li> but once I got them all set up,  they stayed in firmly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of $40.</li>
            <li> Instructions should be done with video, was a little confusing.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, the teeth are cartoon like and are horrid, I ordered the small thinking I have a small mouth and small teeth</li>
            <li> I would need an XTRA small for my teeth</li>
            <li> Made my lip bulge out at the top just looked weird. :(</li>
            <li> I want to give this negative o stars but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money doesn&#x27;t work looks fake.</li>
            <li> these are ridiculous!</li>
            <li> but I had an extremely difficult time trying to mold them to my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased such a horrible product.</li>
            <li> They look like the fake vampire teeth you get for halloween.</li>
            <li> so mad</li>
            <li> They are very fake looking.</li>
            <li> I have bad teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought they would not be as flimsy :((</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed !</li>
            <li> It hurts and looks awful.</li>
            <li> Just horrible.</li>

            <li> I got my imako teeth today . I am 43/female I have bad teeth. I hadn&#x27;t seen my family in one year I can&#x27;t afford dentures .  I tried one other set it didn&#x27;t work so I deciddd buy more expensive set. I saw this and I think this will get me thru when see my family and may use them while at work.    Thanks  now I won&#x27;t be embarrasses this products great and highly recommend these imako teeth to anyone who might be questionable :)</li>
            <li> I ordered a pair of the Imako teeth not knowing what to expect.. I needed to send my top partial out for repair which was leaving me with the two front teeth missing and none on the left side.  I was amazed at the outcome, no one even knew they were not mine. They were easy to prepare&lt;br /&gt;after watching the video.  I was so pleased with this product and would recommend it.  Thank you Imako ,</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipment! Excellent product for price! I work in the medical field and wear these to hide a missing front tooth. Love them! Thank you for making them available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fits very well and looks great and very timely delivery</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome... If you can&#x27;t figure out how to use them..you are not worthy..  They work... With work...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the teeth got a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> do they make a bottom set in this brand</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful I feel young again, as when the world was new. I fitted them today and put them in and went to work. Everyone was amazes by how real they looked. Made me feel very proud to smile again:) I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s self confident about the smile and how other see it.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the derision given and fit them in. Might take a few try&#x27;s to fit them the way that feels and looks well. But in the end you will have a smile you feel good about.... And it doesn&#x27;t matter how you look on the out side or how others see you but how YOU feel on the inside that what matter :) good luck and here&#x27;s to your new smile .... PS they do take some time getting use to.</li>
            <li> I want to give this negative o stars but can&#x27;t. It was the fakest looking piece of junk I ever ordered. Threw it straight in the trash can...if you gave this good ratings you work for the company, simple as that, cause this is a piece of s*** and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was expecting.  I felt confident in ordering this product after reading the reviews but I had an extremely difficult time trying to mold them to my teeth and they did not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> I did not like it because I didn&#x27;t know I had to put it together and I would like to have my money back.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. They basically stick to your gums. They are very fake looking.</li>
            <li> The stupidest thing I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, the teeth are cartoon like and are horrid, I ordered the small thinking I have a small mouth and small teeth yeah I would need an XTRA small for my teeth these are ridiculous!</li>
            <li> This is trash Im so mad I waste my money for this.</li>
            <li> I thought they would not be as flimsy :(( but once I got them all set up,  they stayed in firmly.  The teeth looked too phoney though. :((</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased such a horrible product. It hurts and looks awful. They look like the fake vampire teeth you get for halloween. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. I bought it in hopes it would help hide my teeth through the next few months as I&#x27;m having some extensive dental work done. But I guess not. Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money doesn&#x27;t work looks fake. They won&#x27;t stay in place were hard to fit in the first place. Made my lip bulge out at the top just looked weird. :(</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product. Im on my fourth set. Great for photos or dating. They look so real. You cant eat with them cause the texture is to soft. Amazing product. I love it. I ware my teeth every day. Im ordering another set this week. I finally have that million dollar smile. Thanks cheer... las vegas. 5 stars</li>
            <li> greatest thing in a pintch</li>
            <li> Just horrible. It protrudes almost as if you have permanent duck lips. I was looking forward to the product as I just have a minor gap in between my front teeth that I am self conscious about.  Definitely a waste of $40.</li>
            <li> VERY happy with my imako purchase! Saved my smile for my son&#x27;s wedding-&lt;br /&gt;I was frightened they would be hard to fit or be loose- not a bit!!! Foolproof and easy- will most certainly buy more!</li>
            <li> Instructions should be done with video, was a little confusing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long. Weren&#x27;t bleached and pretty big for a small! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these you will be disappointed !</li>
            <li> fast shipping great will buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I never imagined they would appear so genuine.  As long as I&#x27;ve worn them, people still don&#x27;t know!  They last much longer than other teeth overlays I&#x27;ve tried.  I will be getting implants eventually.  I&#x27;m not too worried, I have three pairs of Imakos.  The trick to a comfortable fit is just follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> These gave me more self confidence</li>
            <li> I love these..............sure are a life savor till i get my false teeth,.</li>
