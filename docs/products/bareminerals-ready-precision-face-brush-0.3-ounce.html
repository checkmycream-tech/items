            <li>great brush for bare escentuals</li>

            <li>Fantastic for foundation and am thinking of buying another one for blusher.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me because I have rosacea and some brushes are just too prickly.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good for the the seller and the product.</li>
            <li>This brush gives a much smoother application than any of the others!!!  </li>
            <li>It applies the powder very smoothly, but the brush is too large for easily angling around my nose.</li>
            <li>I already owned this but since my sister tried mine and liked it so much better than her similar brush (MAC)</li>
            <li>Made to work with Bare Escentuals Ready foundation and does a great job.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with this brush and have had little problems after using for a week now.</li>
            <li>I liked it better for applying the bare minerals foundation that comes in a compact rather than using the brush that is used to apply the loose powder mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is my very favorite Bare Escentuals brush for Bare Minerals Foundation Powder!!!  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastically constructed and can be used in so many different ways, one of which is, as an &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>overall, I am glad that i purchased the item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So soft, I love applying my bare minerals foundation with it, ready and original formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and dense!!  </li>
            <li>any other BE brush I own.</li>
            <li>This item was delivered prior to expected delivery date and packaging was very good and new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, but dense</li>
            <li>This brush really made a difference in my makeup application.</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on smoother and much easier.</li>
            <li>very well made.</li>
            <li>I do really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>Does not hold the powder, and does not blend very well.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and sealed very well üëç</li>
            <li>I have the bare minerals brush that was to be used with the bare skin foundation, but this brush is much better.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the Bare Essentials compact foundation and it works really well to give full coverage.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly, and was the bare minerals brush as advertised.</li>
            <li>This Bare Escentuals brush is soft and the foundation goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft and applies the compact version of the BM makeup very well without over applying.  </li>
            <li>These bristles were softer, but were more tightly put together.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Feels very soft to skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to use with the Bare Minerals Ready foundation.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out like some other ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>Not too much of an angel and not too big of brush.</li>
            <li>soft  feel on the skin, doesn&#x27;t breakdown.</li>
            <li>have had my brush for two years so far</li>
            <li>This is the softest brush I have ever used and with the angle, I can get directly under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge angles in my face, nor do I know anyone who does, so I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the angled brush is.  </li>
            <li>It gives full coverage with few strokes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are synthetic (the same model in the store is real) and as a result, the effect is not the same.</li>
            <li>It helps me to need less foundation and makes it the finish on my skin very smooth, subtle and makes the foundation much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered to apply bare minerals pressed powder foundation to my face.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is soft and feels like pampering compared to Sheer Mineral &amp; Pur brushes!  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I just bought one as a gift for my sister who also uses Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I very been using bare Minerals for a few years now and have had mixed experience with the brushes.</li>

            <li> It gives full coverage with few strokes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are synthetic (the same model in the store is real) and as a result, the effect is not the same.</li>
            <li> It helps me to need less foundation and makes it the finish on my skin very smooth, subtle and makes the foundation much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered to apply bare minerals pressed powder foundation to my face.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is soft and feels like pampering compared to Sheer Mineral &amp; Pur brushes!  </li>

            <li> I just bought one as a gift for my sister who also uses Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I very been using bare Minerals for a few years now and have had mixed experience with the brushes.</li>
            <li> then any other bare escentuals brush that I have used.</li>
            <li> I just hope that the bristles do not start to fall out as the other bare minerals brush did.  </li>
            <li> I use loose mineral makeup for my foundation and have rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and hasn&#x27;t failed me so far.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s firm at the same time.</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> I also received a silver limited edition brush instead of black.</li>
            <li> and I kept steeling from each other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals since the late 90s.</li>

            <li> probably as well as any other kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> and it takes less to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I find that I use less  foundation makeup.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush because it was a bit less than the ones sold in the store.</li>
            <li> It helps to use less product, so my makeup lasts longer!</li>
            <li> Sometimes they are stiff and scratchy.</li>
            <li> The Pur Minerals brush that should go along with the foundation was not good for me and it shed - leaving brush hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> Neglected to read return policy and after brush worked poorly for this use, couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to liquid base</li>

            <li> The absolute best brush that offers amazing coverage. If you don&#x27;t think a high quality brush makes a difference you will be convinced with this brush!!! Better coverage then any other bare escentuals brush that I have used. My new favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this brush. It&#x27;s super soft, but dense so it&#x27;s firm at the same time. Because it&#x27;s dense it&#x27;s perfect for extra coverage and leaving your face looking air brushed. The more you use it the better it works as you build up make up in the brush and it takes less to cover your face. Best makeup brush I have ever used and it&#x27;s a super deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I received it quickly. I like how it allows me to apply my makeup without it caking up on  my face</li>
            <li> The best brush for any mineral make- up. It is easy to use and provides great coverage. A must buy.</li>
            <li> I very been using bare Minerals for a few years now and have had mixed experience with the brushes. Sometimes they are stiff and scratchy. This one is so soft &amp; seems to blend in the make up more efficiently.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FACE PRECISION FACE BRUSH USE IT EVERY DAY WORTH BUYING IT. WORTH THE PRICE TOO. WOULD DEF RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This item was delivered prior to expected delivery date and packaging was very good and new.  As for the brush itself, I love it.  I find that I use less  foundation makeup.  I have the bare minerals brush that was to be used with the bare skin foundation, but this brush is much better.  I just hope that the bristles do not start to fall out as the other bare minerals brush did.  So far, so good for the the seller and the product.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastically constructed and can be used in so many different ways, one of which is, as an &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34;. If you&#x27;ve applied too much blush or bronzer, the shape of this brush works beautifully to take away excess product without streaking or stripping what has been already applied. It&#x27;s soft. It doesn&#x27;t shed. And the price is truly unreal for the  superb quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful coverage!! Bought this brush at the recommendation of a BareMinerals consultant and was the best decision I made regarding their products!  Gets much better coverage with the powder foundation, the brush is much softer, and the angled nature allows you to get everywhere on your face.  Wish I had had this brush ten years ago!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific makeup brush. The best that I have used to apply Bare Mineral makeup. You get better coverage if you use the correct brush. You learn this as you go along. I,am so happy that I read the reviews and you will be glad you ordered one. The seller is great and fast shipping. The price worked for me. I will be looking for more great brushes. I also received a silver limited edition brush instead of black. LOVE IT... Thank you Amazon and seller.</li>
            <li> The angle of this brush is perfect for blush on cheekbones.  Not too much of an angel and not too big of brush. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever bought!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes. So soft, I love applying my bare minerals foundation with it, ready and original formula.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush. Great coverage .Nice soft  feel on the skin, doesn&#x27;t breakdown. Picks up the right amount of Powder.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very even coverage!! This brush helps me apply my Bare Escentuals foundation flawlessly, and I feel like I have to use much less.</li>
            <li> The right brush for the perfect application.  This brush helps concentrate the coverage of the red on my cheeks and age spots.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful! It applies powders so evenly and feels great.</li>
            <li> Ordered to apply bare minerals pressed powder foundation to my face. Neglected to read return policy and after brush worked poorly for this use, couldn&#x27;t return. I tried several times, looking at video on BM website for technique. Even using tiniest bit, looked cakey. Bare Minerals is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to apply liquid foundation to smooth it out. Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It is soft and feels like pampering compared to Sheer Mineral &amp; Pur brushes!  I will not hesitate to purchase again.  It gives full coverage with few strokes.  Excellence in a brush...well done!</li>
            <li> Quality always by Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;The slant of the brush makes a lot of difference with your application</li>
            <li> This brush really made a difference in my makeup application. Foundation goes on smoother and much easier.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and my daughter and I kept steeling from each other. I just had to have my own. Great brush for use with the ready foundation... work better then any other BE brush I own.</li>
            <li> Super soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out like some other ones. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite Bare Escentuals brush for Bare Minerals Foundation Powder!!!  It&#x27;s super soft and dense!!  I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals since the late 90s. I&#x27;m 42 now.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for 1.5 years and LOVE IT!!! This brush gives a much smoother application than any of the others!!!  I just bought one as a gift for my sister who also uses Bare Minerals.  She loves it as well and says it is now her favorite!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.Fantastic for foundation and am thinking of buying another one for blusher.  Really good quality. Would recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brush I have ever used!! It helps to use less product, so my makeup lasts longer!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Great coverage with this brush.</li>
            <li> Perf brush for the bareMinerals READY¬Æ Foundation SPF 20</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than pleased with this brush and have had little problems after using for a week now. I have no issues with the hairs coming out like prior purchasers, because I&#x27;m using as the brush is instructed (buffing) NOT as most are using (circular motions). Definitely sold on the brush.</li>
            <li> Really great brush, works amazingly with my ready foundation. It&#x27;s very soft and hasn&#x27;t failed me so far. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for a full coverage foundation when using bare minerals! It&#x27;s a must!! I will never go back to liquid base, this brush helps me get the same coverage while being gentler for my skin!</li>
            <li> I use loose mineral makeup for my foundation and have rosacea.  This brush does a great  job of applying the makeup and is soft.  That&#x27;s important to me because I have rosacea and some brushes are just too prickly.  This one is perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to shed either....very well made.</li>
            <li> I do really like this brush.  I use it with the Pur Minerals 4-in1 pressed foundation.  The Pur Minerals brush that should go along with the foundation was not good for me and it shed - leaving brush hairs on my face.  This Bare Escentuals brush is soft and the foundation goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid foundation brush I have ever had. I already owned this but since my sister tried mine and liked it so much better than her similar brush (MAC) I have bought this for her for Christmas. It helps me to need less foundation and makes it the finish on my skin very smooth, subtle and makes the foundation much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t I have this years ago and have suffered through using my fingers or other shaped brushes? The design of the brush is great it used to sort-of &#x27;stipple&#x27; on the product rather than use a &#x27;wiping&#x27; sort of motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my brush for two years so far and it&#x27;s still in excellent condition (I wash it after each use). This brush has been very much worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Good brush- Full coverage/ foundation brush that works well with Bare Essentials READY mineral powder foundation. I like this brush!</li>
            <li> I got this brush because it was a bit less than the ones sold in the store. I should have known. The bristles are synthetic (the same model in the store is real) and as a result, the effect is not the same. Does not hold the powder, and does not blend very well.  I ended up using it for my mineral veil, which it does a better job.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft and applies the compact version of the BM makeup very well without over applying.  I liked it better for applying the bare minerals foundation that comes in a compact rather than using the brush that is used to apply the loose powder mineral foundation.  These bristles were softer, but were more tightly put together.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Great for use with Bare minerals pressed foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Made to work with Bare Escentuals Ready foundation and does a great job.  Very happy with my purchase.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great brush for bare escentuals</li>
            <li> I use this with the Bare Essentials compact foundation and it works really well to give full coverage.  I apply this in my office and I don&#x27;t like how powder seems to go everywhere, but I do like the look it gives.  I need the coverage to cover some blemishes.</li>
            <li> The brush was a bit pricy, but I am one that tends to use what goes with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It works great and spread the foundation evenly.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I am glad that i purchased the item.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I can find a match to this style of brush.</li>
            <li> i love my new brush. fast shipping and sealed very well üëç</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush I have ever used and with the angle, I can get directly under my eyes. *LOVE IT!*</li>
            <li> Pretty good as far as kabuki brushes go.  I don&#x27;t have huge angles in my face, nor do I know anyone who does, so I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the angled brush is.  But it gets the job done....probably as well as any other kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I have brushes, lipsticks, etc., some good purchases and some just so&#x3D;so, but this one is soft, and perfect for the new Bare Escentuals make-up.  What I look at is the finished look it gives my complexion, along with any new items I use to perfect my average looking skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Feels very soft to skin. And the bristles do not fall out!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with the Bare Minerals Ready foundation. It applies the powder very smoothly, but the brush is too large for easily angling around my nose. It buffs the powder very well and gives good coverage. I just wish it was a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, and was the bare minerals brush as advertised. It&#x27;s so soft and leaves a great finish. I love it, and am so happy with this purchase.</li>
