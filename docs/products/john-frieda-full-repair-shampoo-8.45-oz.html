            <li>Most people think that I am in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I love it, would definetily buy it again.</li>
            <li>my hair is more silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>my hair is so silky smooth now!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>Perfect Ends Sheer Mist (I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Nice product, quick ship</li>
            <li>I dye my hair  and this full repair really makes my hair feel and look great.</li>
            <li>After shampooing with this product my hair feels nice relaxed and clean ... clean without residues.</li>
            <li>I have never had hair this silky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>and I must say, the 1st day I saw a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>i love it very much ..</li>
            <li>My hair is much more flowy, silky, healthy looking, soft, non frizzy, touchable, and manageable!</li>
            <li>BUT,  I don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  </li>
            <li>it stays true to what the product says.</li>
            <li>If it didn´t say it was a &amp;#34;body full shampoo&amp;#34;, I would not have guessed that after using it.</li>
            <li>On the third tube and love it more every day.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t repair much of the dryness that I would have like, but still a great daily shampoo.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the fact that this says for heavily styled or colored hair scare you off if you don&#x27;t do these things, its even great for repairing damage from the sun and pool over the summer.</li>
            <li>I got this product in a department store for $5.49, but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It´s moisturizing, smells good, and left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m still going to buy it, it&#x27;s for sure my new favorite shampoo and conditioner hands down. :]</li>
            <li>No more fried ends on my face, fly aways sticking out of my head</li>
            <li>Thanks to your reviews here - tried the John Frieda Full Repair Shampoo and Conditioner - Absolutely the answer to a hair junkie&#x27;s prayers!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle.</li>
            <li>So, this product is really a beauty boost for me!  </li>
            <li>definitely  wouldn&#x27;t write a review if it was okay</li>
            <li>I used this almost daily and has been much better than others.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t repair my baby hairs that poke out quite as well as the longer strands, but maybe it just needs more time.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, fine hair, and it didn´t dry my hair as most shampoos do.</li>
            <li>but when i brought those John frieda full repair full body shampoo help my hair improve back</li>
            <li>and I use the long hair to cover the sides of my face to appear more oval shaped.      </li>
            <li>My hair is usually very prone to tangles and knotting, however I recently drove in a convertible and my hair was surprisingly easy to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li>I would very very very highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>hair/ really needed some help-and Got it.</li>
            <li>thanks reviewers .</li>
            <li>Yeah i have really really damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Its a real time saver in the morning.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos that I use leave my hair more dry than before I showered, which sucks because my hair needs to be shampooed every day or it will be super oily.</li>
            <li>Well today i used the John Frieda Full Repair shampoo and conditioner because i needed the life of my hair back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried too many leave in products that just weigh my hair down, and make it oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair blonde for many years and would use a color treated shampoo to keep the blonde.</li>
            <li>no more \\&quot;gotta wait for 2nd day after shampoo\\&quot; for good hair day -</li>
            <li>Your hair just becomes super silky, so its more difficult to hold certain styles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, although I could have written the same review after the first use because I immediately noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend felt it on accident and said, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought the same shampoo twice in a row - never could find the right \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; - Got it!</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>I was going to cut my hair considerably shorter,</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, it is shiny, it has volume.  </li>
            <li>cause the platinum was too much and then 2 months later died it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give full body, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair either.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo on a whim after seeing it was new in my local drug store.</li>
            <li>I am a 54 year old woman with long, fine, medium thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Well yesterday, i was walking down the shampoo isle and i was looking for products that help my really really damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I do not blow dry my hair, just let it try naturally.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know which, but starting from about 2-3 inches from my scalp, the breakage is unreal all the way down to the ends.      </li>
            <li>My only complaint, and its not really a complaint, is that it really does take any texture you do have out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair, I normally HAVE to wash it at lease every other day if not sooner.</li>
            <li>I recently dyed my hair from natural blonde to very dark brown, so I needed a new shampoo because I have been using one for blondes specifically to avoid brassiness.</li>
            <li>As for the volume, maybe it did add a little bit of body, but nothing really noticeable...</li>

            <li> As for the volume, maybe it did add a little bit of body, but nothing really noticeable...</li>
            <li> After the 2nd day, my hair didn&#x27;t look half as oily as it normally does.  </li>
            <li> My hair also feels truly clean, which I&#x27;ve had an issue with in the past because it seemed that some repairing shampoos just weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> Although damaged hair cannot truly be \\&quot;repaired\\&quot; except by trimming it off, this shampoo goes a long way to help my damaged, dry hair feel and look healthier.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products to tame my colored, and heat damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Lets see, I straighten and sometimes curl my hair constantly everyday, blow dry it everyday, take a shower everyday because I&#x27;m a clean freak, and i put hair products in my hair everyday,</li>
            <li> left my hair with volume but a little dry,  </li>
            <li> With this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that, I can even comb through my hair when it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I highlighted my hair, then the next day I bleached it twice (trying to go platinum)</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, smooth, and the broken hairs that are almost all the way down my long hair, are hardly noticeable!      </li>
            <li> I usually buy all kinds of shampoo especially if it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> However, since beginning to use this shampoo, I can no go every other day.</li>
            <li> I have a very wide square face</li>
            <li> But to combat this, I just add a little bit of a texture spray to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and usually wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been straightening down the frayed ends &amp; it eventually got so bad that i decided to spend some decent money on product.</li>
            <li> something serious.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really bad for the last 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I have longer hair, very thick, and a medium texture.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t like to go to France looking awful.      </li>
            <li> Well needless to say it FRIED my hair</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m undecided and my hair was a WRECK of frizziness and damage.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and got damaged when I started to color it.</li>
            <li> It gives me shine, manageability and body like crazy-</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this shampoo! was deliverable in time</li>
            <li> Thanks to your reviews here - tried the John Frieda Full Repair Shampoo and Conditioner - Absolutely the answer to a hair junkie&#x27;s prayers! My color treated/highlighted/dry hair/ really needed some help-and Got it. It gives me shine, manageability and body like crazy- no more \\&quot;gotta wait for 2nd day after shampoo\\&quot; for good hair day - And it is really is safe on the color!  Every day is a good hair day. Can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought the same shampoo twice in a row - never could find the right \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; - Got it! On the third tube and love it more every day.  Again- thanks reviewers .</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products to tame my colored, and heat damaged hair. I&#x27;ve tried too many leave in products that just weigh my hair down, and make it oily. Most shampoos that I use leave my hair more dry than before I showered, which sucks because my hair needs to be shampooed every day or it will be super oily. With this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that, I can even comb through my hair when it&#x27;s still wet. Plus it smells AMAZING. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, it smells more like a good perfume than a shampoo. My boyfriend loves it. I got this product in a department store for $5.49, but it was worth every penny. I will definitely be buying this over and over again.</li>
            <li> When I was in Florida, I bought a travel size of this product.  I loved it.  When I returned home, I&lt;br /&gt;could not find it anywhere in my area.  Love the product.  It does not leave my hear greasy.  It leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I am a 54 year old woman with long, fine, medium thick hair.  I have tried so many products and even have put in some reviews here on amazon.  My hair has been really bad for the last 4 years or so.  It has either been breaking a lot or I have a lot of gray hairs (that have been dyed,) I really don&#x27;t know which, but starting from about 2-3 inches from my scalp, the breakage is unreal all the way down to the ends.      I just tried all of the products from this line...the shampoo, conditioner, Root lift foam, Perfect Ends Sheer Mist (I have fine hair, there&#x27;s another for coarser hair), and Touch up Flyaway Tamer.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference!  My hair is shiny, smooth, and the broken hairs that are almost all the way down my long hair, are hardly noticeable!      I am going to go to France at the end of May.  If I hadn&#x27;t found a product like this I was going to cut my hair considerably shorter, BUT,  I don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  I have a very wide square face and I use the long hair to cover the sides of my face to appear more oval shaped.      So, this product is really a beauty boost for me!  Most people think that I am in my 30&#x27;s.  I really wouldn&#x27;t like to go to France looking awful.      I would very very very highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> So i went to the grocery store to by some shampoo and conditioner. I usually buy all kinds of shampoo especially if it&#x27;s on sale. Well yesterday, i was walking down the shampoo isle and i was looking for products that help my really really damaged hair. Lets see, I straighten and sometimes curl my hair constantly everyday, blow dry it everyday, take a shower everyday because I&#x27;m a clean freak, and i put hair products in my hair everyday, oh and i color it every 6 months. Yeah i have really really damaged hair. Well today i used the John Frieda Full Repair shampoo and conditioner because i needed the life of my hair back. I tried it today and what can i say?- it stays true to what the product says. My hair is much more flowy, silky, healthy looking, soft, non frizzy, touchable, and manageable! no joke! i  definitely  wouldn&#x27;t write a review if it was okay but this product is way more than okay, its awesome! I just don&#x27;t like how \\&quot;small\\&quot; the bottles are...i prefer it to be bigger for the price i pay. But i&#x27;m still going to buy it, it&#x27;s for sure my new favorite shampoo and conditioner hands down. :]</li>
            <li> I only bought this because I had a coupon and I got it for 97 cents, but I am very, very pleased with it.  I have oily hair, I normally HAVE to wash it at lease every other day if not sooner. With this shampoo, for 1, I only had to wash my hair once, instead of twice, and 2, after 10 hours of work, my hair looked as if I had just washed it.  After the 2nd day, my hair didn&#x27;t look half as oily as it normally does.  It also kept my flyaways at a minimum and it smells awesome!  My hair feels soft, it is shiny, it has volume.  I&#x27;m so going back to the store and stocking up!</li>
            <li> Nice product, quick ship</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo on a whim after seeing it was new in my local drug store. I have been using John Freida&#x27;s volumizing line for quite a while. I have longer hair, very thick, and a medium texture. I recently dyed my hair from natural blonde to very dark brown, so I needed a new shampoo because I have been using one for blondes specifically to avoid brassiness. This shampoo is amazing. I have never had hair this silky and easy to manage. I have an oily scalp and usually wash my hair everyday. However, since beginning to use this shampoo, I can no go every other day. Its a real time saver in the morning. I also use the matching conditioner. My hair is usually very prone to tangles and knotting, however I recently drove in a convertible and my hair was surprisingly easy to comb through afterwards. Its really great to fill like you have healthy, silky hair. My only complaint, and its not really a complaint, is that it really does take any texture you do have out of your hair. Your hair just becomes super silky, so its more difficult to hold certain styles. But to combat this, I just add a little bit of a texture spray to my hair. I would suggest this shampoo (&amp; conditioner) to ANYONE. Don&#x27;t let the fact that this says for heavily styled or colored hair scare you off if you don&#x27;t do these things, its even great for repairing damage from the sun and pool over the summer.</li>
            <li> After shampooing with this product my hair feels nice relaxed and clean ... clean without residues. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using anything else.</li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;Volume&amp;#34; shampoo. The word &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; or the word &amp;#34;Volume&amp;#34; does not appear anywhere on the label.</li>
            <li> I love it, would definetily buy it again. my hair is more silky and shiny. but I had a hair falling problem too and this shampoo does not helping</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and got damaged when I started to color it. I used this almost daily and has been much better than others. Doesn&#x27;t give full body, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair either. Didn&#x27;t repair much of the dryness that I would have like, but still a great daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this shampoo! Although damaged hair cannot truly be \\&quot;repaired\\&quot; except by trimming it off, this shampoo goes a long way to help my damaged, dry hair feel and look healthier. I absolutely love it. It has a pleasant scent, and adds moisture to my hair without leaving any residue. My hair also feels truly clean, which I&#x27;ve had an issue with in the past because it seemed that some repairing shampoos just weighed my hair down. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, although I could have written the same review after the first use because I immediately noticed a difference in my hair. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for hair repair. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair blonde for many years and would use a color treated shampoo to keep the blonde. It worked great until it fried my hair. This shampoo definitely helped my hair to feel softer and not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t repair my baby hairs that poke out quite as well as the longer strands, but maybe it just needs more time. Overall, I would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> After just one use my hair feels incredible. It was dyed, fried and looked like straw before I tried this. My boyfriend felt it on accident and said, \\&quot;Wow! What did you do to your hair?\\&quot; I am very happy with both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have tried finding products before that would help my hair &amp; this one works. I had never highlight/bleached my hair until this year &amp; I am 22. Well needless to say it FRIED my hair something serious. I&#x27;ve just been straightening down the frayed ends &amp; it eventually got so bad that i decided to spend some decent money on product. I purchased this shampoo along with the glaze and I must say, the 1st day I saw a HUGE difference. No more fried ends on my face, fly aways sticking out of my head, it is wonderful &amp; I LOVE the smell! I will definitely stick with this product, that is, until my hair builds an immunity to it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing and amazing doesn&#x27;t even do it justice. A few months ago I highlighted my hair, then the next day I bleached it twice (trying to go platinum) then a month later I did lowlights cause the platinum was too much and then 2 months later died it brown (lol). Needless to say I&#x27;m undecided and my hair was a WRECK of frizziness and damage. If it wasn&#x27;t for this product I&#x27;d be bald!!!! my hair is so silky smooth now! Love it</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very gentle. I have very sensitive, fine hair, and it didn´t dry my hair as most shampoos do. It´s moisturizing, smells good, and left my hair soft and smooth. As for the volume, maybe it did add a little bit of body, but nothing really noticeable... If it didn´t say it was a &amp;#34;body full shampoo&amp;#34;, I would not have guessed that after using it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shampoo. I dye my hair  and this full repair really makes my hair feel and look great. Only shampoo I Wii use.</li>
            <li> left my hair with volume but a little dry,  I do not blow dry my hair, just let it try naturally.</li>
            <li> i love it very much ..it s help my hair improve go away damage hair from perm .i will never do perm again forever cause my hair damage but when i brought those John frieda full repair full body shampoo help my hair improve back again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
