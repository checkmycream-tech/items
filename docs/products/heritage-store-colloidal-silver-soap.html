            <li>/&gt;The producer don&#x27;t understand or don&#x27;t have good taste.&lt;br /&gt;There is a great antibacterial soap with wonderful &amp; mild smell...</li>

            <li>I love this soap!</li>
            <li>This soap smells amazing and made my boils shrink.</li>

            <li>Great Soap, lathers up fine , will order again,  nice clean smell</li>
            <li>good clean smell.</li>
            <li>this is more affordable for kids to um ... be wasteful, sort of.</li>
            <li>This is some of the nicest soaps we have ever used, and it is such a wonderful feeling knowing that the colloidal silver inside this soap is so healthy and healing for our skin.</li>
            <li>and I doubt I shall purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, I just wished it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I love this and another silver soap.</li>
            <li>Google this soap &amp; vitamin companies for better deals on shipping &amp; even on prices for a bar.</li>
            <li>you can spend more money on a soap, there are many \\&quot;silver soap\\&quot; out there.  </li>
            <li>Will be getting more.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent also.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep on using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gotta step up the routine of taking a weekly Thursday shower (Whether or not I need it) to perhaps twice a week perhaps for better results.</li>
            <li>Love this soap...</li>
            <li>It does have a medicinal smell, but I do not find it overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>So glad to of found this product.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it after reading that colloidal silver is effective in helping to heal skin ulcers from chronic venous insufficiency.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this soap was/is worth</li>
            <li>Other than that, excellent exfoliant and cure all for skin conditions from a to z.</li>
            <li>However, the soap is strong removing skin oils and drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stand its strong smell so am using on my foot, but not my face.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves you rejuvenated, with soft clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well and has a mild, pleasant scent- sort of like Patchouli.</li>
            <li>Great soap, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>use a Weleda moisturizing facial lotion afterwards and the condition has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.</li>
            <li>But this soap is terrific and smells great.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>you know i love this clean, fresh scented bar - leaves no perfume</li>
            <li>This soap works well, but I have used another brand that has a higher content of silver in it that does work better, but is also twice the cost ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I am a repeat buyer of this amazing soap and will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>For me, especially with my psoriasis, this soap is exceptionally more effective than the neem soap.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but excellent and effective product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean without over drying or the (stripped) sensation.</li>
            <li>The pleasant smell lasts a short while, and my S.O. likes it too.</li>
            <li>It smells rather herbal and it lathers up very nicely and did not leave my face taught and dry.</li>
            <li>Was an okay product but didn&#x27;t really help my rash.</li>
            <li>As for me, this is good enough to use without breaking my bank and convenience to get from everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With such good results, I experimented with colloidal silver soap on my face to treat rosacea.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price .</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with the silver gel each night and have seen a great turn about in my skin tone and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any new break outs really since using this product in a week straight.</li>
            <li>(Lucky Vitamin</li>
            <li>Tried this soap, and rash went away quickly.</li>
            <li>We use Colloidal Silver as defense against infection around our house (only second to vinegar wash), to treat most every &#x27;hurt&#x27;, now we&#x27;ve added a great soap too.</li>
            <li>My first aide kit contains a bottle of Colloidal silver (Very high potency) for many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting some more!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the try if your having break outs.</li>
            <li>Always worth looking about.)</li>
            <li>This is, by far, our favorite soap for him.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was fast and, for such a well-made soap, surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Oh and yes, it does have a distinct smell but</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast got here two days before scheduled</li>
            <li>Love the smell &amp; did not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for all those hard to heal spots.  </li>
            <li>But the shipping for a bar and multiple bars of this soap is over the top.</li>
            <li>This is an another stinky soap like many commercial soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>most definitely i will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>Great soap I used it on a regular basis, gentle enough for baby and toddler.</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair with it as well, and it leaves my scalp and hair feeling luxuriously clean and soft!</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and the silver helps clean out cuts and scrapes, preventing infection.  </li>
            <li>Lavender combo for example) will be much better faster relief in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just feel better having this soap on hand for minor scrapes and scratches.</li>
            <li>This soap smells quite nice, though the color is a bit odd.</li>
            <li>Now that I know how slippery it makes my skin, I am much more careful.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It works gently but thoroughly with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Soap makes skin feel fresh, also soft.</li>
            <li>I began having very dry,red spots on my face that no lotion, moisturizers etc. seemed to help.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Totally clean feeling after use, does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It cleans and calms my skin better than any other soap I&#x27;ve used and it has replaced my face wash.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin totally moisturized, soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Love it but found it on many other websites for less $</li>
            <li>I found this soap to be both gentle (especially as compared with other therapies) and highly effective in promoting healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shingles are getting better and the pain is less.</li>
            <li>Where I buy my favorite Peony White Tea is actually cheaper</li>
            <li>You can buy it at Whole foods, so not only available online, but locally obtainable for reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Completely clear skin!!</li>
            <li>naturally heals !!</li>
            <li>Had a few things to pick up through Amazon today and so was going to order more soap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft, even after using several times a day to wash my hands.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am large so I need a bigger bar.</li>
            <li>My Rosacea began to clear up after using this soap twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I use a water softener, as I prefer soft water, so I am used to it.</li>
            <li>I started using it too and it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the soap to be formulated with more oil to prevent this or at least minimize the drying effect.</li>
            <li>For a natural product it does the job.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft too.</li>
            <li>Other than being a quality soap, I see no health benefit or compelling reason for the silver in it.</li>
            <li>I order on a regular basis and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>our family seems to have skin problems and the silver-soap seems to calm them down from scalp to feet.</li>
            <li>Also it dried rather quickly</li>
            <li>It helped to clear my psoriasis instantly.</li>
            <li>This soap however left my skin so soft and slippery</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;ve only used it for a week</li>
            <li>Gentle on dry skin!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I found this soap at Whole foods, I used to mix it with other soap when needed (I still do if strength is needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the natural - mild soap that provides the base as well.</li>
            <li>We struggled to find any soap or wash that would not dry him out.</li>
            <li>She uses it to wash her hair and let it really get down to her scalp.  </li>
            <li>It worked within days to clear the dry spots and redness.</li>
            <li>really perfumee stings my eyes a little</li>
            <li>a little expensive, but still a good soap</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It leaves the skin soft and the silver helps clean out cuts and scrapes, preventing infection.  </li>
            <li> Lavender combo for example) will be much better faster relief in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just feel better having this soap on hand for minor scrapes and scratches.</li>
            <li> This soap smells quite nice, though the color is a bit odd.</li>
            <li> Now that I know how slippery it makes my skin, I am much more careful.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works gently but thoroughly with no irritation.</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin super soft, even after using several times a day to wash my hands.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am large so I need a bigger bar.</li>
            <li> My Rosacea began to clear up after using this soap twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I use a water softener, as I prefer soft water, so I am used to it.</li>
            <li> I started using it too and it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the soap to be formulated with more oil to prevent this or at least minimize the drying effect.</li>
            <li> For a natural product it does the job.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft too.</li>
            <li> Other than being a quality soap, I see no health benefit or compelling reason for the silver in it.</li>
            <li> I order on a regular basis and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> our family seems to have skin problems and the silver-soap seems to calm them down from scalp to feet.</li>
            <li> Also it dried rather quickly</li>
            <li> It helped to clear my psoriasis instantly.</li>
            <li> This soap however left my skin so soft and slippery</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve only used it for a week</li>
            <li> Gentle on dry skin!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I found this soap at Whole foods, I used to mix it with other soap when needed (I still do if strength is needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the natural - mild soap that provides the base as well.</li>
            <li> We struggled to find any soap or wash that would not dry him out.</li>
            <li> She uses it to wash her hair and let it really get down to her scalp.  </li>
            <li> It worked within days to clear the dry spots and redness.</li>
            <li> really perfumee stings my eyes a little</li>
            <li> a little expensive, but still a good soap</li>
            <li> I have a scalp dry skin and itching and this works as a solid shampoo for that too.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no film residue or dry feeling, no lotion or baby oil needed after a shower or bath with this soap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to anyone who has problems with dry skin or scalp.</li>
            <li> Yes, \\&quot;anti bacterial\\&quot; soap is not helping your condition at all (the reason is alcohol based products is not strong enough for the above problem).</li>
            <li> so I could put it away dry, not still wet.</li>
            <li> Bad acne has plagued me most of my life and I&#x27;m getting close to 50.</li>
            <li> but closed area like no air circulation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;every\\&quot; penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> Did not really see an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It was not very drying though</li>
            <li> /&gt;highly recommended for anyone with any skin discoloration due to fungal issues.</li>
            <li> If you fall into this category, ditch any SLS/Paraben/ other man-made chemical soap.  </li>
            <li> Works immediately on any type of dark spot on the skin.</li>
            <li> nothing that the average person would consider offensive.</li>
            <li> Of course these prices seem to swing up and down quite a lot from time to time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with skin irritations from other soaps.</li>
            <li> She has awful breakouts mostly on her head.  </li>
            <li> No more itching.  </li>
            <li> Or perhaps it&#x27;s the counter to the hard water and over use of salt to soften the water that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
            <li> Slow lathering.</li>
            <li> I think our very hard water has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but it works wonders for the skin.</li>
            <li> He never use to wear shorts because he was ashamed of his legs, now he wears shorts all the time unless its cold out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this amazing soap and will be purchasing more in the future.  Great Seller!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Shipping makes it a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I soap my face up every evening, let it sit for two minutes, and rinse!! Gentle on dry skin!! I rinse my face in the morning, apply moisturizer and I&#x27;m all set for the day. Completely clear skin!!</li>
            <li> Was an okay product but didn&#x27;t really help my rash.</li>
            <li> my kids like how it works on the acne</li>
            <li> I use colloidal silver soap to kill bacteria on my skin. It helps fight acne a lot without drying my skin. My kids use it 2-3 times a day also. Bad acne has plagued me most of my life and I&#x27;m getting close to 50. This soap works well, but I have used another brand that has a higher content of silver in it that does work better, but is also twice the cost ... this is more affordable for kids to um ... be wasteful, sort of. It is well worth the try if your having break outs.</li>
            <li> This is the most refreshing bath soap I&#x27;ve ever used!! It smells great and leaves you rejuvenated, with soft clean feeling skin. There&#x27;s no film residue or dry feeling, no lotion or baby oil needed after a shower or bath with this soap. I would recommend that anyone having problems with today&#x27;s soaps try Colloidal Silver Soap especially if you don&#x27;t like having a lot of chemicals in your bath soap. Colloidal Silver Soap contains: Olive oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Potash, Rosemary, Essential Oil, and Colloidal Silver. Even though this soap contains oils it does not leave an oily feel on your skin.  No Animal Fats.</li>
            <li> This is some of the nicest soaps we have ever used, and it is such a wonderful feeling knowing that the colloidal silver inside this soap is so healthy and healing for our skin. Great product, Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This soap smells quite nice, though the color is a bit odd. I use a water softener, as I prefer soft water, so I am used to it. This soap however left my skin so soft and slippery I almost fell in my shower! Now that I know how slippery it makes my skin, I am much more careful. The pleasant smell lasts a short while, and my S.O. likes it too. Other than being a quality soap, I see no health benefit or compelling reason for the silver in it. While a good soap, at this price it is a luxury for me and I doubt I shall purchase more.</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing and made my boils shrink. I love this soap, I just wished it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I love this and another silver soap. This smells good and makes your skin feel nice too. I have a scalp dry skin and itching and this works as a solid shampoo for that too. I had to cut my hair short to use a solid soap easier. But as one mentioned the Pacific Northwest seems to have a lot of skin issues. I think our very hard water has a lot to do with it. Or perhaps it&#x27;s the counter to the hard water and over use of salt to soften the water that&#x27;s the problem. Anyway you cut it our family seems to have skin problems and the silver-soap seems to calm them down from scalp to feet. Had a few things to pick up through Amazon today and so was going to order more soap. But the shipping for a bar and multiple bars of this soap is over the top. Google this soap &amp; vitamin companies for better deals on shipping &amp; even on prices for a bar. Where I buy my favorite Peony White Tea is actually cheaper so I will be picking up both there. (Lucky Vitamin but there are others as well it&#x27;s just they happen to carry these two favored things so together they off-set the shipping by buying in bulk like 4-5 boxes of tea and 6-8 bars of soap.) If this vendor would set up a way to save on the shipping for mulitple bars that might help here on Amazon. But for multiple bars the shipping went up for each bar the same as one. So it&#x27;s close to 9-10 dollars per. (Like another reviewer I do like another slightly larger bar of Colloidal Silver soap rated at .999 silver and you can find it for under 6 dollars with shipping for say 4 bars at around 9 today. That makes them cheaper then than these today here too. Of course these prices seem to swing up and down quite a lot from time to time. Always worth looking about.)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for all those hard to heal spots.  Great for over worked hands with nicks from the garden or scratches from pets too! We use Colloidal Silver as defense against infection around our house (only second to vinegar wash), to treat most every &#x27;hurt&#x27;, now we&#x27;ve added a great soap too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got stubborn skin spots that my dermatologist recommended using &#x27;selsun blue&#x27; on. that didn&#x27;t work, and only irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;started using this soap and they&#x27;re almost all gone.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended for anyone with any skin discoloration due to fungal issues.</li>
            <li> My first aide kit contains a bottle of Colloidal silver (Very high potency) for many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Before I found this soap at Whole foods, I used to mix it with other soap when needed (I still do if strength is needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have Candida, Athlete&#x27;s foot, Jock itch, yeast infection, or anything related to fungus over growth problem. If you fall into this category, ditch any SLS/Paraben/ other man-made chemical soap.  Yes, \\&quot;anti bacterial\\&quot; soap is not helping your condition at all (the reason is alcohol based products is not strong enough for the above problem). This soap and shampoo (Castile soap + Silver / Tea tree+ Lavender combo for example) will be much better faster relief in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you don&#x27;t have conditions like above, you can use if you are:&lt;br /&gt;Outside all day in the Summer weather - Sweat/dust/people&#x27;s germ ....&lt;br /&gt;Inside but closed area like no air circulation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When kids get cut and scrapes, you want to wash their wound area with soap - Use this soap that doesn&#x27;t feel like alcohol sting at all.  Then proceed to treat with Colloidal silver to wipe the area, then tea tree oil.... naturally heals !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just an example why you could benefit from using this soap.  You can buy it at Whole foods, so not only available online, but locally obtainable for reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;If you can spend more money on a soap, there are many \\&quot;silver soap\\&quot; out there.  As for me, this is good enough to use without breaking my bank and convenience to get from everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, cleans wells. Good on irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this soap was/is worth \\&quot;every\\&quot; penny spent on it. It has definitely lived up to the hype. It is a bit expensive but it works wonders for the skin. So far i&#x27;ve only used it for a week &amp; i&#x27;m well please. My skin is \\&quot;super-sensitive\\&quot; but this soap is working wonderfully. So if you have the bucks to spend, &amp; want/need a soap that treats your skin well this is one of the best. If not the best, haven&#x27;t tried cor silver soap yet so when I do i&#x27;ll write a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I originally bought it after reading that colloidal silver is effective in helping to heal skin ulcers from chronic venous insufficiency. I&#x27;d been struggling with fragile skin on my legs not healing for 2 years. After I started cleansing with this soap and using colloidal silver gel on dressings, it healed over within 3 weeks. I was extremely happy with those results. With such good results, I experimented with colloidal silver soap on my face to treat rosacea. I&#x27;ve had great results cleansing with this soap and using the prescription my doctor prescribed with toning and moisturizing routine. I love the natural - mild soap that provides the base as well.</li>
            <li> Great soap, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Recommended for acne too.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SKIN PROBLEMS I AM WORK ON MY 4TH ORDER</li>
            <li> It smells rather herbal and it lathers up very nicely and did not leave my face taught and dry. Also it dried rather quickly so I could put it away dry, not still wet. Seems like it is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a skin dryness on back of hand, used it twice and can&#x27;t believe the difference. Will be getting more. The shipping was super fast got here two days before scheduled</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and very sensitive skin. We struggled to find any soap or wash that would not dry him out. This is, by far, our favorite soap for him.  It leaves the skin soft and the silver helps clean out cuts and scrapes, preventing infection.  I started using it too and it leaves my skin soft.  It has a lovely scent also.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather and how great is knowing that it is taking care of any problems you may have.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap to help with inflammation of the skin.  It works gently but thoroughly with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! Works immediately on any type of dark spot on the skin. It helped to clear my psoriasis instantly. the spots are getting lighter and lighter with each usage. It also leaves my skin totally moisturized, soft and clean! I love it and will keep on using it. For me, especially with my psoriasis, this soap is exceptionally more effective than the neem soap. This soap has no fragrance. The moisturizing effect is exceptional!</li>
            <li> best soap for my husband. he suffers from skin cysts and this works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my Scalp Psoriasis &amp; resultant dandruff at bay...when I remember to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta step up the routine of taking a weekly Thursday shower (Whether or not I need it) to perhaps twice a week perhaps for better results.</li>
            <li> My son has skin problems on his legs, this is the only item we found that helps.  It took it away, and now he uses it just to keep it from coming back.  He never use to wear shorts because he was ashamed of his legs, now he wears shorts all the time unless its cold out.</li>
            <li> My Rosacea began to clear up after using this soap twice a day.  It is drying.  It  stings my eyes if I get soap in them.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Weleda moisturizing facial lotion afterwards and the condition has improved greatly.  I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! However, the soap is strong removing skin oils and drying out the skin. I would prefer the soap to be formulated with more oil to prevent this or at least minimize the drying effect.</li>
            <li> a little expensive, but still a good soap</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price .</li>
            <li> Love it but found it on many other websites for less $</li>
            <li> This is an another stinky soap like many commercial soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand its strong smell so am using on my foot, but not my face.&lt;br /&gt;Even if it is effective to skin disorders, I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;The producer don&#x27;t understand or don&#x27;t have good taste.&lt;br /&gt;There is a great antibacterial soap with wonderful &amp; mild smell...[[ASIN:B001WX0F86 Defense Soap Bar - 5 Pack]]</li>
            <li> this soap is awesome!!!  most definitely i will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. It lathers up really well and has a mild, pleasant scent- sort of like Patchouli. It leaves my skin super soft, even after using several times a day to wash my hands. I have washed my hair with it as well, and it leaves my scalp and hair feeling luxuriously clean and soft! I would recommend this soap to anyone who has problems with dry skin or scalp. I will definitely be getting some more!</li>
            <li> Love this soap...good clean smell.</li>
            <li> I just feel better having this soap on hand for minor scrapes and scratches.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh. Slow lathering. I think it also helps with controlling body order. After all, coillodal silver kills bacteria, fungus,etc.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I bought it. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> really perfumee stings my eyes a little</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey but I love it! For a natural product it does the job.</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful</li>
            <li> Colloidal silver has been shown to have healing and antimicrobial qualities. Part of wound therapy is attention to cleanliness and avoidance of any chance of infection. I found this soap to be both gentle (especially as compared with other therapies) and highly effective in promoting healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and, for such a well-made soap, surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Great soap I used it on a regular basis, gentle enough for baby and toddler.</li>
            <li> Soap makes skin feel fresh, also soft. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great service and product.Thank you</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this soap via the blogger &amp;#34;Delighted Momma&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been having hormonal issues with my skin and Heritage Store Colloidal Silver Soap was my fix. It cleans and calms my skin better than any other soap I&#x27;ve used and it has replaced my face wash.</li>
            <li> Size was the only letdown, knowing this product can be made under $1. Other than that, excellent exfoliant and cure all for skin conditions from a to z.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my mother who suffers from shingles.  She has awful breakouts mostly on her head.  They are very painful.  She has been using this soap for about 6 weeks now.  She uses it to wash her hair and let it really get down to her scalp.  The shingles are getting better and the pain is less.</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous. The company is great; will buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff, better if it was unscented though. (gag)</li>
            <li> Good for scrubbing hands.  Antibacterial.  Also good in the shower after working in the yard all day.  It does have a medicinal smell, but I do not find it overwhelming at all.  I order on a regular basis and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great Soap, lathers up fine , will order again,  nice clean smell</li>
            <li> Clean-smelling antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but excellent and effective product. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am large so I need a bigger bar.But this soap is terrific and smells great.It is a feel-good product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I began having very dry,red spots on my face that no lotion, moisturizers etc. seemed to help. Then I tried this. It worked within days to clear the dry spots and redness. My face is so soft too. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and well priced. Reduces skin inflammation and flakiness for sufferers of eczema or seborrhea related problems. Also very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Had a very annoying itchy rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Tried this soap, and rash went away quickly. Love the smell &amp; did not dry my skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it for my face and body. Totally clean feeling after use, does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Did not really see an improvement in my skin. It was not very drying though so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> you know i love this clean, fresh scented bar - leaves no perfume scent behind...natural and neutral...</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous. I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with skin irritations from other soaps. This soap is actually soothing to the skin. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This helped by daughters eczema a lot.  She loves this soap.  No more itching.  And she loves the smell.</li>
            <li> So glad to of found this product. It leaves my skin feeling clean without over drying or the (stripped) sensation. I use this in combination with the silver gel each night and have seen a great turn about in my skin tone and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any new break outs really since using this product in a week straight. Oh and yes, it does have a distinct smell but nothing that the average person would consider offensive.</li>
