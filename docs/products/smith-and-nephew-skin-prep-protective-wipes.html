            <li>Excellent product</li>
            <li>Great service and price very fair.</li>
            <li>This wipe works great for me for when I put on my Omnipod pump or my DexCom sensor.</li>
            <li>These work great for preventing irritation from the adhesive.</li>
            <li>These work great for applying K Tape.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use this on my scalp before I put my tape on for my lace front.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this product at night to help calm the diabetic nerve pain on the bottom of his feet &amp; it has been  excellent for him.</li>
            <li>For having to change the appliance without bathing first the wipes do triple duty and they are great for  travel and emergencies..</li>
            <li>Good price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This is very good for bunions that are very sensitive as well as bedsores ..making sure the surrounding tissues does not breakdown.</li>
            <li>These are simply the best skin prep &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; wipes ever made!  </li>
            <li>I am a patient with Type 1 Diabetes, so I have tried a lot of skin prep wipes to hold my insulin pump on better.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best non-sterile skin prep on the market</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different brands &amp; types &amp; this is the best.  </li>
            <li>; :) to speed it up.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t confident after using one to try them again.  </li>
            <li>quick shipment - very satisfied - A+</li>
            <li>She used this recently during a hospital visit and surprisingly the hospital doesn&#x27;t stock this, so we were glad we brought our own.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good package.</li>
            <li>Now its easy on and easy off.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Helps it stay secure and without infections.</li>
            <li>They are pricier than alcohol wipes, to be sure, but when the cost of wasting the nasal strips is taken into account, it&#x27;s worth is to purchase this to provide the adhesion needed.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel that the area is as clean.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve made an area for clean connection with the appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They provide a great adhesive spot to place everything and create an environment where I seldom have any issues with the site coming loose.</li>
            <li>The IV Preps, while good, for IVs, don&#x27;t hold enough of the adhesive to hold my pump on, THESE DO!  </li>
            <li>Because it is the kind with alcohol, it cleans the area completely and can even take off any adhesive residue (from not using this product).  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a spray that is great for right after bathing the area is clean &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li>Doing it quickly helps.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY product of its kind that worked on my patient.</li>
            <li>Stings like the dickens when first applied but quickly dries and can then be layered on.</li>
            <li>Holds tape, but comes right off</li>
            <li>I use them to prep my skin for use with the Breathe Right Nasal Strips.  </li>
            <li>This solved the problem and it&#x27;s not difficult to remove, either.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed, lot&#x27;s of prep moisture to use on a large area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a long time, I have not been able to get these because my provider sent me IV Prep wipes from Smith &amp; Nephew.  </li>
            <li>Now I use a wipe prior to putting on a patch and it sticks fine and doesn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li>First in an emergency or non-bathing situation, the wipes will simply wipe the area clean.</li>
            <li>It works real well.</li>
            <li>These strips leave a slight texture on the skin surface that keeps the adhesive on the nasal strips gripping well.  </li>
            <li>It was probably nothing but better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer to dry which keeps one from having a quick application process.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean well or dry</li>
            <li>They contain just the right amount of liquid -- enough to thoroughly drench the pad and a little bit more -- and the pad is woven, so that it holds the Skin Prep solution and wipes</li>
            <li>I use these wipes to place a new site for my insulin pump.</li>
            <li>As I describe below, this works so well every time that it is worth the second of stinging on any sensitive spot.  </li>
            <li>Have very sensitive skin and this product helped&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw I could get it on Amazon in a hurry !</li>
            <li>The Skin Prep wipes have saved my sensitive skin from &amp;#34;stripping&amp;#34; when removing my VGO insulin delivery system.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve really cleaned the raw areas that would normally be cleaned with the alcohol</li>
            <li>It dries quickly while covering the stoma with a thick square of tissue just in case.  </li>

            <li> These are simply the best skin prep &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; wipes ever made!  I am a patient with Type 1 Diabetes, so I have tried a lot of skin prep wipes to hold my insulin pump on better.  This brand, and this type (Skin Prep) are wonderful!  They contain just the right amount of liquid -- enough to thoroughly drench the pad and a little bit more -- and the pad is woven, so that it holds the Skin Prep solution and wipes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time, I have not been able to get these because my provider sent me IV Prep wipes from Smith &amp; Nephew.  TRUST ME, they are NOT the same!!!  The IV Preps, while good, for IVs, don&#x27;t hold enough of the adhesive to hold my pump on, THESE DO!  And for the lady who put these on her vagina -- they are NOT for that area!  They are &amp;#34;skin preps&amp;#34;, NOT &#x27;vaginal fold preps&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, just BUY these; you won&#x27;t regret it.  And, if you are a practitioner of medicine, your patients will appreciate the attention to detail that it took to choose these, rather than just get whatever your office manager (who knows nothing about medicine) orders because they were the &#x27;cheapest&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Antonio</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin Prep Protective Wipes for 15 years or so. Fantastic product. I use them for cleaning the skin site for my insulin pump infusion set and continuous blood glucose sensor. Helps it stay secure and without infections. Would not want to go without them.</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive skin and this product helped&lt;br /&gt;Great product for those of us with medical situations that require using products that have some sort of adhesive needed to attach to our skin&lt;br /&gt;Saves your skin  from bruising and tearing</li>
            <li> This wipe works great for me for when I put on my Omnipod pump or my DexCom sensor.</li>
            <li> Simply the best non-sterile skin prep on the market</li>
            <li> As an insulin pump wearer, you don&#x27;t want to take a chance of the pump coming lose on your skin. These wipes have always done the job. I have never had an issue of my omnipod coming loose.</li>
            <li> The ONLY product of its kind that worked on my patient. Stings like the dickens when first applied but quickly dries and can then be layered on. We used for colostomy appliance prep, but was useful in other dressing areas that are difficult to keep a dressing in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different brands &amp; types &amp; this is the best.  It also comes in a spray that is great for right after bathing the area is clean &amp; dry.  For having to change the appliance without bathing first the wipes do triple duty and they are great for  travel and emergencies.. First in an emergency or non-bathing situation, the wipes will simply wipe the area clean. Because it is the kind with alcohol, it cleans the area completely and can even take off any adhesive residue (from not using this product).  It dries quickly while covering the stoma with a thick square of tissue just in case.  If impatient all you have to do is &amp;#34;put your lips together and blow&amp;#34; :) to speed it up. As soon as it&#x27;s try move the tissue in an inactive moment  and put on the device. It holds well and if necessary for several days.  There will be no residue left on removing the device later.  It works for band aids too...wherever adhesive could pull your skin, leave a rash or itch from adhesive. It can sting if there is a little cut or red area.  As I describe below, this works so well every time that it is worth the second of stinging on any sensitive spot.  Doing it quickly helps.  Once it is applied nothing will sting again. If it is raw around the opening in a bigger way, I just hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the non-sting varieties, even the one made by this company but none of them companies.  They don&#x27;t have the same advantages.  They are rather slippery or oily feeling and I don&#x27;t feel that the area is as clean.  It takes much longer to dry which keeps one from having a quick application process.  It doesn&#x27;t clean well or dry well because it&#x27;s just plain wet. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve really cleaned the raw areas that would normally be cleaned with the alcohol and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve made an area for clean connection with the appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is reimbursable but is so inexpensive that if I forget to turn it in it&#x27;s no big deal. I was surprised when I saw I could get it on Amazon in a hurry !</li>
            <li> This product gets a 10 in my book.  I use pain patches and always have a problem getting them, not only to stick, but to stay on. Occasionally I would find a patch in my bed in the morning.  Now I use a wipe prior to putting on a patch and it sticks fine and doesn&#x27;t come off.  I read on some of the reviews that it made it more difficult to remove but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case.  Now its easy on and easy off.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> We were having a problem in the extreme Arizona summer heat in keeping an insulin pump attached to the skin.  This solved the problem and it&#x27;s not difficult to remove, either.</li>
            <li> These work great for preventing irritation from the adhesive.</li>
            <li> The Skin Prep wipes have saved my sensitive skin from &amp;#34;stripping&amp;#34; when removing my VGO insulin delivery system.  Glad to have found them.</li>
            <li> These work great for applying K Tape. Holds tape, but comes right off</li>
            <li> This is very good for bunions that are very sensitive as well as bedsores ..making sure the surrounding tissues does not breakdown.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes to place a new site for my insulin pump. They provide a great adhesive spot to place everything and create an environment where I seldom have any issues with the site coming loose.</li>
            <li> Great service and price very fair. A++++</li>
            <li> This is a great product that you can&#x27;t find anywhere else!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product at night to help calm the diabetic nerve pain on the bottom of his feet &amp; it has been  excellent for him. Actually it was recommended to him by a physical therapist &amp; I will definitely re-order this again when needed.</li>
            <li> quick shipment - very satisfied - A+</li>
            <li> Same preps used in a hospital setting.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected</li>
            <li> This product works as promised. My wife has severe reactions to adhesive, so this product lays down a protective layer that tape can be attached to.  She used this recently during a hospital visit and surprisingly the hospital doesn&#x27;t stock this, so we were glad we brought our own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now with no complaints.  The vendor&#x27;s pricing is excellent and delivery is on or ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I use them to prep my skin for use with the Breathe Right Nasal Strips.  I was using alcohol wipes, but would find that the strips didn&#x27;t hold well.  These strips leave a slight texture on the skin surface that keeps the adhesive on the nasal strips gripping well.  I often find that one strip will remain in place for a couple of days.  They are pricier than alcohol wipes, to be sure, but when the cost of wasting the nasal strips is taken into account, it&#x27;s worth is to purchase this to provide the adhesion needed.</li>
            <li> These work like they are supposed to but they have a bit of a tint to them that concerned me.  I wasn&#x27;t confident after using one to try them again.  It was probably nothing but better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good package.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed, lot&#x27;s of prep moisture to use on a large area.  I will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> This was bought for a friend and he said this is the only brand he uses. It holds well and isn&#x27;t irritating. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Great product, I use this on my scalp before I put my tape on for my lace front.  It works real well.</li>
            <li> After surgery years ago I developed a horrible allergy to tape. My skin develops itchy, seeping and painful blisters. This product is the only thing that helps. I&#x27;ve had 7 surgeries since then, and this has saved my sanity and life.</li>
