            <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>She loves it and calls it \\&quot;sexy candy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I guess I was looking more for Eau de parfum and not edt.</li>
            <li>Love it for travel.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume it lingers</li>
            <li>this is easily my top five favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>and I love Giorgio Armani acqua di gioia eau de parfum spray.</li>
            <li>it was for my husband friend and she love it</li>
            <li>I did not fall in love with the price till I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to always check seller reviews before buying perfumes here, but the one I received from Amazon was definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>This is a fresh and clean daytime fragrance that is great for summer or warmer months.</li>
            <li>Good for wearing to work and for those who are sensitive to very strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>When it arrived she was surprised and happy, points for me</li>
            <li>I enjoy it and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>It is very light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I love it so much that I am going to make sure that I order more before I run out.</li>
            <li>you can imagine, I was hesitant to try a new perfume without smelling it first, but being an &amp;#34;Acqua&amp;#34; product, plus the great reviews, I took the plunge and went for it.</li>
            <li>I adore &amp;#34;Acqua di Gio&amp;#34; for men so when I saw this I was so excited, as I thought it was a version of Acqua di Gio for women (not realizing that an Acqua di Gio for women already existed).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aquatic, citrusy, and fresh without being too sweet and overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is soft and elegant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty but not my style.</li>
            <li>My Daughter found this scent in a magazine and instantly feel in love.</li>
            <li>Very floral and smells like sunflowers.</li>
            <li>so the 1 OZ works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of an updated Escape by CK with a modern \\&quot;sweetness\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have usually gone for the more sweet almost candy like smells (like Britney Spears perfumes)</li>
            <li>this is more of a floral smell with a small hint of sweet a minute or two after you have sprayed it.</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t last long, pretty sure this is not the real thing!</li>
            <li>that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, for an ounce, which normally sells for $48, I purchased here for just $36.99!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this a few times since I bought it a month ago, and each time I&#x27;m reminded of how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Perfumes are subject to personal preference, but my daughter adores this one - long lasting and nice light smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;Notes: Like buying any perfume/cologne online if you haven&#x27;t smelled it first try this scent at a local mall/department store, then get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first and last time I will ever buy a perfume without smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>Not heavy, but stays with me through out the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh smelling, but without the typical linen &amp; cotton like scents.</li>
            <li>Later that night I ordered it on Amazon as a surprised to her.</li>
            <li>I would like a little bigger bottle but didn&#x27;t wanna buy to much in case</li>

            <li> Omg this must be fake or something, this has absolutely no scent...sending it back!!</li>
            <li> My go to summer fragrance - floral without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this from Ulta/Sephora/Dept Stores before and it usually lasts all day - this maybe for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> and I need to reapply after 2-3 hours, which sucks considering the price.</li>
            <li> But now I couldn&#x27;t care less that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral with a hint of sweetness and definitely subtle.</li>
            <li> me a terrible headache.</li>

            <li> LOVE THIS, SMELLS THE BEST &amp; VERY AGREEABLE PRICING.&lt;br /&gt;FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> My wife had a sample of this in her Cosmo magazine. She asked if I liked it, and I did. Later that night I ordered it on Amazon as a surprised to her. When it arrived she was surprised and happy, points for me lol. When she tried it on it smelled better then in the magazine, truly a wonderful scent. It gets my attention every time she puts it on, as well as gets many compliments from friends who smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great scent! Great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Like buying any perfume/cologne online if you haven&#x27;t smelled it first try this scent at a local mall/department store, then get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural spicy scent....not strong, not weak, perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  Not heavy, but stays with me through out the day.</li>
            <li> My go to summer fragrance - floral without being too heavy.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Omg this must be fake or something, this has absolutely no scent...sending it back!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but not my style. Very floral and smells like sunflowers. I was hoping for a fresher and cleaner scent.</li>
            <li> I adore &amp;#34;Acqua di Gio&amp;#34; for men so when I saw this I was so excited, as I thought it was a version of Acqua di Gio for women (not realizing that an Acqua di Gio for women already existed). But now I couldn&#x27;t care less that I was wrong. In fact, I&#x27;m glad, because this is the most beautifully smelling perfume I can imagine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can imagine, I was hesitant to try a new perfume without smelling it first, but being an &amp;#34;Acqua&amp;#34; product, plus the great reviews, I took the plunge and went for it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, for an ounce, which normally sells for $48, I purchased here for just $36.99! Bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like &amp;#34;Acqua di Gio&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll love this. If on the fence, go for it girl! You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice perfume and it shopped as promised.  It makes my lady smell wonderful.  I recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. I have usually gone for the more sweet almost candy like smells (like Britney Spears perfumes) this is more of a floral smell with a small hint of sweet a minute or two after you have sprayed it. I use perfume only when I go places so the 1 OZ works very well for me. I would like a little bigger bottle but didn&#x27;t wanna buy to much in case I didn&#x27;t like it. GREAT perfume. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Caught a whiff of this at SFO of all places. Had to get this for my wife.  She uses perfume sparingly so this 1 oz will last forever. Reminds me of an updated Escape by CK with a modern \\&quot;sweetness\\&quot;. She loves it and calls it \\&quot;sexy candy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Smells great, just no staying power. I guess I was looking more for Eau de parfum and not edt.</li>
            <li> If you like flowery fragrances, this is not for you. It&#x27;s fresh smelling, but without the typical linen &amp; cotton like scents.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and perfect price!! Love it for travel.</li>
            <li> The woman smelled it in a magazine and asked for it.  It has a nice smell, I like it on her and she is happy.</li>

            <li> This is a fresh and clean daytime fragrance that is great for summer or warmer months. It&#x27;s floral with a hint of sweetness and definitely subtle. Good for wearing to work and for those who are sensitive to very strong fragrances. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long on me and I need to reapply after 2-3 hours, which sucks considering the price.</li>
