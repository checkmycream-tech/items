            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>No clunky 4 batteries like most brands don&#x27;t tell you!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and very happy with this product</li>
            <li>The mist it provides is very very light.....</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I love my nano mister.</li>
            <li>It is actually better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>so you want to make sure you fully charge your mister when the spray weakens/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than ibeauty (wider model)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more sturdy and slimmer for better grip.</li>
            <li>Love love~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, convenient, and</li>
            <li>This atomization does cost more than the iBeauty one, however I like that</li>
            <li>and I just love this product, so do my clients.</li>
            <li>The mist looks like steam, but &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; is the appropriate word for it.</li>
            <li>The mist can easily be breathed in to moisten the air passages.</li>
            <li>so light you can breathe it in.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great makeup tool especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It completely stopped working within weeks - with very light use, by the way; I did not use it on many clients at all.</li>
            <li>Also I love showing my clients who also live it now for even refreshing from the hot weather here in Atlanta!</li>
            <li>It holds more than a teaspoon for sure and you can use a slightly diluted version of any of your Favorite must or toners.</li>
            <li>I work at a well known salon and introduced it to our makeup artist who normally uses a spray bottle that one of our products comes in., but now this lovely nano mist saves makeup from being spurted rather than set.</li>
            <li>It actually looks really nice</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it would work both on batteries and the ability to recharge for times that it is not convenient to be able to recharge with the mechanism it has available</li>
            <li>pure  bliss!</li>
            <li>It also came with a cute little organza bag with red hearts, which was perfect (it only fits the mister though).</li>
            <li>Thanks again Anzikang!</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>to marketing- adjust your dye pigment with more purple in the pink and ta-dah!</li>
            <li>Ok product, first few try no mist at all....</li>
            <li>I usually use the Evian spray but this is a better investment because I can refill  it.</li>
            <li>and much cheaper than other places!</li>

            <li> The h2o2 must be food-grade, and diluted at least 1:11 parts water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this skin gadget!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I really hate it because I never got to use it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These Feel amazing! Perfect for curing eyelash extensions when I don&#x27;t feel like bothering with the airbrush/compressor setup. I also use this for misting Evian on my face... pure  bliss!</li>
            <li> The mist it provides is very very light.....so light you can breathe it in. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then you&#x27;ll love this. I was hoping to replace the Evian spray cans I spend a fortune on every summer, but these are not going to cut it in August!</li>
            <li> Edit: The nano mister did not last. It completely stopped working within weeks - with very light use, by the way; I did not use it on many clients at all. It will no longer spray, even when plugged into the outlet. ------------------------------------------------------ I love my nano mister. I was a bit iffy deciding on which mister to buy as I have read reviews that some of them stopped working after a couple uses, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50-100+ so I took a chance on this.  It is actually better than I thought it would be. The less charge it has, the weaker the mist will be so you want to make sure you fully charge your mister when the spray weakens/doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of breaking down so that&#x27;s good. (Fingers crossed since I will be using this a lot to cure lash extensions)  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; was that I ordered the mister in pink as the only two options at the time were white or pink. However, I received a red one. It actually looks really nice and I think I would prefer it over a pink one anyways, but if I was really set on a pink color, that would have been disappointing. It also came with a cute little organza bag with red hearts, which was perfect (it only fits the mister though).</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Works Great I use this for Lash Extensions</li>
            <li> Best deal I got. It&#x27;s better than ibeauty (wider model) it&#x27;s more sturdy and slimmer for better grip. Love love~</li>
            <li> this is a great great product! It&#x27;s cute, convenient, and effective!&lt;br /&gt;the package looks nice too! it even came with a little bag to put the product in that u can carry around!&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect! and much cheaper than other places!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It is quite nifty and works well to set/refresh makeup. I usually use the Evian spray but this is a better investment because I can refill  it. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and I&#x27;ve only charged it twice. I think this is a great makeup tool especially for the price! buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> Great for eyelash extensions!</li>
            <li> This atomization does cost more than the iBeauty one, however I like that I do not need to purchase batteries for it, rather I can just plug it in and recharge.  It really works well.  My only wish is that it would work both on batteries and the ability to recharge for times that it is not convenient to be able to recharge with the mechanism it has available</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this skin gadget! I work at a well known salon and introduced it to our makeup artist who normally uses a spray bottle that one of our products comes in., but now this lovely nano mist saves makeup from being spurted rather than set. Also I love showing my clients who also live it now for even refreshing from the hot weather here in Atlanta! It&#x27;s also rechargeable! No clunky 4 batteries like most brands don&#x27;t tell you! I suggest the white though because the pink is slightly a little too much feminine personal thingy or something 😳so people second glanced at first!&lt;br /&gt;Note to marketing- adjust your dye pigment with more purple in the pink and ta-dah! Problem solved. Otherwise this thing rocks! It holds more than a teaspoon for sure and you can use a slightly diluted version of any of your Favorite must or toners. Some toners could create a residue and hinder the nebulizer. Rose water is awesome! Thanks again Anzikang! Or Cooskin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I really hate it because I never got to use it.  Omitted from the description is the fact that the product should not be used if you have heart issues...implanted heart devices, etc.</li>
            <li> I do eyelash extensions and I just love this product, so do my clients. Thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This works great. It produces a finer mist than you would get from an atomizer such as a perfume spray bottle. The mist can easily be breathed in to moisten the air passages. This makes it great for hydrogen peroxide therapy for people with breathing problems. The h2o2 must be food-grade, and diluted at least 1:11 parts water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This doesn&#x27;t work by producing steam. The mist looks like steam, but &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; is the appropriate word for it.</li>
            <li> I like it especially for my travels. The only thing is it leaks.</li>
            <li> Ok product, first few try no mist at all.... Found easier if you face the nozzle downward... Not super convenient to use, not sure it&#x27;s the problem of the design or product defect..</li>
