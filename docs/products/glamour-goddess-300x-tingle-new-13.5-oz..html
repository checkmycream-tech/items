            <li>love the tingle</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>My wife works at a tanning salon and this was a better price than with her employee discount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better tingle than this</li>
            <li>for being a 300x sizzle I found this to be more warning than anything.</li>
            <li>had no nasty after tanning odor with this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My all time favorite tingle without bronzers or dha.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job :)</li>
            <li>Love it, I just started using tingle lotion and love the results.</li>
            <li>Your color turns out much better than lotions with bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>However, it does cause the blood to come closer to the top of the skin</li>
            <li>I use another product and it does tingle when I am in the tanning bed and makes me much more tan.  </li>
            <li>love this lotion</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this lotion will intensify the bronze and tan in just 1 session.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you like tingle and no bronzer this is a great lotion I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For the price, its pretty good.</li>
            <li>Strong tingle, could have a better smell</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I even use it outdoors in the Arizona sun and it work fine.  </li>
            <li>Best tanning product ever, less tingling than original Goddess</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great product - similar to Ruby or Roar if you have tried those.</li>
            <li>if the tingle and after 2 hours it fades to a great deep bronze tan.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice natural looking tan, not orange like most lotions do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone tanning and gotten dressed in a white tank afterwards, and even after sweating there was no stains on my clothing which I love!!</li>
            <li>bright white and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>and i definitely have gotten nice color from it!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this strong of a tingle if you have never used tingles, I would go with bombshell first!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
            <li>Good price for a lotion, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>this glamour goddess is a good buy i have used it for only a month</li>
            <li>Super hot lotion added color after one use!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it gives me a nice dark tan &amp; I</li>
            <li>Its hot like it says it is!</li>
            <li>I liked better than the previous one I had used which was 200XXX.  </li>
            <li>High tingle factor.. Very good for dark tan.</li>
            <li>Its ok, i expected more</li>
            <li>of corse if u have milk white skin and are sensitive then you shouldnt use a tingle at all unless you have used them before and know what you are getting into....bottom line GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not my first tingle lotion, but so far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>it gets you nice and red at first because</li>
            <li>There is very little tingle, and I did not notice great results.</li>
            <li>There is a delay of about 10 to 15 minutes but when the tingle kicks in it is very, very real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of GODDESS forever, and now GLAMOUR GODDESS is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>I got fast results with Ruby!</li>
            <li>First off let me start by saying i use tingle lotions all the time.</li>
            <li>&amp; it is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I like a really hot, tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>and I seem to get a better tan from it than I do from regular tanning oils.  </li>
            <li>First lotion I&#x27;ve tried that compares to Goddess.</li>
            <li>It gives an amazing color boost and I get soooo dark</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty intense for a couple hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>The tingle isn&#x27;t too intense but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tingle as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really have a tingle would not buy it or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li>Also did not get much color from the lotion either.</li>
            <li>This should be used for ADVANCED tanners only.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I really like</li>
            <li>but Modern Bombshell feels hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a hotter tingle I&#x27;d go for the orginal bombshell, Modern Bombshell, or ruby</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It does not have much tingle to it.  </li>
            <li>But I have used much \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; lotions than this one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s coconut line same as the original goddess.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, the consistency is great (not too thick, not too runny), the tingle is obvious but not overwhelming,  and there is no discoloration of the skin or hands after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super moisturizing but most tingles aren&#x27;t (except for Designer Skin Ruby)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle-</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion if you like tingle - it gets you immediate color but be wary of the feel..</li>
            <li>anyone can put shrink-wrap on their products to have them APPEAR to be NEW</li>
            <li>( Those with sensitive skin would probably not do well with the high tingle factor.)</li>
            <li>and i compared and is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I tan after work since when I went at lunch - I got too hot and red looking.</li>
            <li>Has gotten me at least 2 more shades darker after only 2 more tanning sessions.. which means I have cut my mins from 12 to 9-10 mins ( depending how hot bed bulbs are from previous uses), which is saving me from using up my mins faster!</li>
            <li>This tingle gives you a little heat and a  little red at time of tanning but a beautiful brown color tan as if you laid out all day by evening.</li>
            <li>It may take a few times to get the quick dark but it is real and lasts not like the bronzers that are instant but orange on most people.</li>
            <li>I use modern bombshell which is the same tingle strength</li>
            <li>The product was delivered a day early.</li>
            <li>however it fades after a few hours and leaves my skin a golden tan!</li>
            <li>Did not enjoy this lotion as a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; IT just made me very hot.</li>
            <li>This has taken place for the GODDESS, seems like minor changes except packaging as far as i can tell?  </li>
            <li>NO 300xx Tingle in my bottle----the bottle I received HAD TO BE OLD, (like sitting on their shelf for a very long time)</li>
            <li>but this lotion is the real deal, half the price at my salon.</li>

            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a hotter tingle I&#x27;d go for the orginal bombshell, Modern Bombshell, or ruby</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> It does not have much tingle to it.  </li>
            <li> But I have used much \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; lotions than this one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s coconut line same as the original goddess.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, the consistency is great (not too thick, not too runny), the tingle is obvious but not overwhelming,  and there is no discoloration of the skin or hands after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super moisturizing but most tingles aren&#x27;t (except for Designer Skin Ruby)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle-</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion if you like tingle - it gets you immediate color but be wary of the feel..</li>
            <li> anyone can put shrink-wrap on their products to have them APPEAR to be NEW</li>
            <li> ( Those with sensitive skin would probably not do well with the high tingle factor.)</li>
            <li> and i compared and is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I tan after work since when I went at lunch - I got too hot and red looking.</li>
            <li> Has gotten me at least 2 more shades darker after only 2 more tanning sessions.. which means I have cut my mins from 12 to 9-10 mins ( depending how hot bed bulbs are from previous uses), which is saving me from using up my mins faster!</li>
            <li> This tingle gives you a little heat and a  little red at time of tanning but a beautiful brown color tan as if you laid out all day by evening.</li>
            <li> It may take a few times to get the quick dark but it is real and lasts not like the bronzers that are instant but orange on most people.</li>
            <li> I use modern bombshell which is the same tingle strength</li>
            <li> The product was delivered a day early.</li>
            <li> however it fades after a few hours and leaves my skin a golden tan!</li>
            <li> Did not enjoy this lotion as a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; IT just made me very hot.</li>
            <li> This has taken place for the GODDESS, seems like minor changes except packaging as far as i can tell?  </li>
            <li> NO 300xx Tingle in my bottle----the bottle I received HAD TO BE OLD, (like sitting on their shelf for a very long time)</li>
            <li> but this lotion is the real deal, half the price at my salon.</li>
            <li> She compared the product to what they sell in the store and says that it is the exact same product as less than half of the price!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it only a few times so far</li>
            <li> I tingle, but my tan fades...going back to bronzing lotions to get my deep, dark tan back!</li>
            <li> I tired it on the skin right above my knee and about 10min</li>
            <li> You do need to have a good base tan before using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Almost unscented--at least to me--which I don&#x27;t particularly like but some people might.</li>
            <li> Very identical to the real thing for users that are questionable about buying lotions on here!</li>
            <li> I actually fell asleep while tanning a few times with this one.</li>
            <li> it is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Millenium Solid Black for about a year-ish and needed to change it up.</li>
            <li> and i dont see any difference like i have with other products.</li>
            <li> I have found none other like it.</li>
            <li> I wont buy it again deffinately not worth the money.</li>
            <li> later it was really crazy red!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made 2 purchases of this lotion, was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> My color has had a dramatic increase in the short two weeks I have been using the Glamour</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will reorder this product when I run out of what I just purchased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to believe it has no bronzers.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a must have for everyone looking to get a serious tan.</li>
            <li> Please have your base tan already established with well moisturized and hydrated skin prior to using GODDESS.</li>
            <li> No orange fake color.</li>
            <li> Sorry to go on about orange</li>
            <li> but it just looks creepy in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally hate the bronzer in tanning lotions because I hate being orange.</li>
            <li> Hate lotions that are too bronzey and leave your hands and clothes a brown tinge.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in it .</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product at all! I used Ruby before this product &amp; they compared it too Ruby, it&#x27;s no comparison!!! I loved the tingle that it had &amp; the color was great....I got fast results with Ruby! Sometimes, trying too save money ends up costing you more!!! I&#x27;ll stick with my moms advice....&amp;#34; STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you can handle a tingler this is an awesome lotion. My tan last longer with this tingler.</li>
            <li> Seriously my favorite lotion. The tingle isn&#x27;t too intense but it&#x27;s there. Gives me a nice natural looking tan, not orange like most lotions do. Bottle came in perfect condition, same smell, texture, and consistency as the one I bought in the salon.</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Its ok, i expected more</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and price</li>
            <li> this is a nice inexpensive lotion.  Personally, I would consider this a T1 or T2 tops.  I have had lotions that set me on fire and this is not one of them.  I do see color results.  I don&#x27;t look orange.  The color of the lotion is off white/cream</li>
            <li> Works fine. Doesn&#x27;t tingle as much as I&#x27;d like. Almost unscented--at least to me--which I don&#x27;t particularly like but some people might. For the price, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have a tingle would not buy it or recommend it to anyone else. I was very disappointed in it .</li>
            <li> Did not enjoy this lotion as a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; IT just made me very hot. Did not feel the tingle effect and I was red for hours. Also did not get much color from the lotion either. Not that great.</li>
            <li> I thought the tingle was mild but it gave me very nice color.  The smell was pleasent and I didn&#x27;t notice an after tan smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! This should be used for ADVANCED tanners only. The tingle sensation is awsome!!! I am brown, brown, brown!!! I use this for two weeks and then switch to Elusive for one week and then back to Glamour Goddess for two. Excellent product. One of my favorites from Designer Skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it gives me a nice dark tan &amp; I love the tingle</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. My mom bought the same one from the tanning salon and i compared and is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Super hot lotion added color after one use! Only thing I wish it had was a bronzer! Very satisfied though!</li>
            <li> First off let me start by saying i use tingle lotions all the time. So i got this because it said 300xxx tingle.  It doesnt tingle at all. I cant even tell i used it. I wont be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Its hot like it says it is! Ive been using it for several weeks and i dont see any difference like i have with other products. I wont buy it again deffinately not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Will def order again good lotion ok tingle</li>
            <li> Burned the hell out of my skin! It made my skin swollen, red and shiny with a burning sensation! I thought it might have been an allergic reaction, but it happened to my fiance too. If you buy, just beware: this could happen to you too.</li>
            <li> NO 300xx Tingle in my bottle----the bottle I received HAD TO BE OLD, (like sitting on their shelf for a very long time) VERY DISAPPOINTED- anyone can put shrink-wrap on their products to have them APPEAR to be NEW</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. Not my first tingle lotion, but so far, my favorite. I was previously using the Millenium Solid Black for about a year-ish and needed to change it up. My color has had a dramatic increase in the short two weeks I have been using the Glamour Goddess.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great, packaging was good, and arrival was quick. Can&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
            <li> My wife works at a tanning salon and this was a better price than with her employee discount.  She compared the product to what they sell in the store and says that it is the exact same product as less than half of the price!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I work at a tanning salon and went to the designer skin training, I immediately knew that I wanted this! I tried it before I bought it and I loved it! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this strong of a tingle if you have never used tingles, I would go with bombshell first! I ended up ordering this online because it was 10-15 dollars cheaper &amp; it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion if you like tingle - it gets you immediate color but be wary of the feel..it&#x27;s pretty intense for a couple hours afterwards. I tan after work since when I went at lunch - I got too hot and red looking. But it&#x27;s a great product - similar to Ruby or Roar if you have tried those. Nice smell afterwards and I am a big fan of all Designer Skin products.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, it was just as I was wanting.  No bronzer&#x27;s just tingle.  I liked better than the previous one I had used which was 200XXX.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Every one told me how good the tingle factor was...I tingle, but my tan fades...going back to bronzing lotions to get my deep, dark tan back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better tingle than this and it was not a 300X tingle but it will work NO I would not buy again</li>
            <li> Very identical to the real thing for users that are questionable about buying lotions on here! Good price for a lotion, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Scent- it&#x27;s coconut line same as the original goddess. I let my girlfriend use it and she said it gave her a headache but I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion- bright white and rubs in easily. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing but most tingles aren&#x27;t (except for Designer Skin Ruby)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle- for being a 300x sizzle I found this to be more warning than anything. I actually fell asleep while tanning a few times with this one. I use modern bombshell which is the same tingle strength but Modern Bombshell feels hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no nasty after tanning odor with this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color boost- it gets you nice and red at first because if the tingle and after 2 hours it fades to a great deep bronze tan. I always like the color I get from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all: 5/5. Great scent, great results, and great lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*if you&#x27;re looking for a hotter tingle I&#x27;d go for the orginal bombshell, Modern Bombshell, or ruby</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion is awesome! i&#x27;ve used it only a few times so far and i definitely have gotten nice color from it! i love it!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! My all time favorite tingle without bronzers or dha. It gives an amazing color boost and I get soooo dark it&#x27;s hard to believe it has no bronzers. Smells amazing and no after tan smell. 5/5 I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of GODDESS forever, and now GLAMOUR GODDESS is my new favorite!  This has taken place for the GODDESS, seems like minor changes except packaging as far as i can tell?  Smells the same etc...  Works very well, Darkest iv&#x27;e been since they discontinued GODDESS;</li>
            <li> There is a delay of about 10 to 15 minutes but when the tingle kicks in it is very, very real. Strong tingle, could have a better smell but it does it&#x27;s job :)</li>
            <li> this glamour goddess is a good buy i have used it for only a month and i have a great tan i dont look orange i look  heathy especially here where the temp is 10 to 15 degrees! i only use tingle lotion and this is  milder in my opinion but it works i do have a reddening once i exit the tanning bed however it fades after a few hours and leaves my skin a golden tan!</li>
            <li> Love it, I just started using tingle lotion and love the results. Your color turns out much better than lotions with bronzer. I t is a great lotion to use when your tan plateaus and you are looking for a great boost of color.</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut and lime. I tired it on the skin right above my knee and about 10min later it was really crazy red! It kind of felt like a sunburn. It also was kind of itchy. I can&#x27;t wait to use this in a tanning bed!(:</li>
            <li> I am a bombshell girl.  This is not bombshell.  There is very little tingle, and I did not notice great results.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product ever, less tingling than original Goddess</li>
            <li> the lotion was in perfect condition and is a good tingle :) I would suggest it to ppl who like bombshell</li>
            <li> Great smell!! But I feel no tingle and no bronzers</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! I love this tanning lotion. It works really good! Im used to the tingle. This has been added to the rotation of lotions I use.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review because I am a experienced tanner...and this lotion is awesome, all designer skin products are great ..good quality and good for your skin..and this seller sent it sealed in the original packaging...delivered within three days....of corse if u have milk white skin and are sensitive then you shouldnt use a tingle at all unless you have used them before and know what you are getting into....bottom line GREAT PRODUCT...I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN,THIS SAME.PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made 2 purchases of this lotion, was very skeptical at first but this lotion is the real deal, half the price at my salon. Love this lotion, great tingle....great color</li>
            <li> Works great! I have found none other like it. I have been using the brand Goddess since 2003 I&#x27;ve only used the tingle lotions none others are the same.</li>
            <li> I like a really hot, tingle lotion. i dont feel like I got quite what I was expecting with this one...300X ?? Not as good as Bombshell 300 X in my opinion...the smell is much better though!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; lotion.  It does not have much tingle to it.  However, it does cause the blood to come closer to the top of the skin and I seem to get a better tan from it than I do from regular tanning oils.  I even use it outdoors in the Arizona sun and it work fine.  You do need to have a good base tan before using this lotion.  But I have used much \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; lotions than this one.  This is a \\&quot;Middle of the road\\&quot; tingle lotion.    I am revising this review.  I have used this product for over three months and can&#x27;t see any difference in places I used it vs. places I did not use it.  It has no tingle and does not appear to provide any tanning advantages.  I use another product and it does tingle when I am in the tanning bed and makes me much more tan.  I am not sure I will reorder this product when I run out of what I just purchased.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning accelerators and for the money, this one gives you a beautiful tan.( Those with sensitive skin would probably not do well with the high tingle factor.)</li>
            <li> Great tingle!  Has gotten me at least 2 more shades darker after only 2 more tanning sessions.. which means I have cut my mins from 12 to 9-10 mins ( depending how hot bed bulbs are from previous uses), which is saving me from using up my mins faster!</li>
            <li> I personally hate the bronzer in tanning lotions because I hate being orange. This tingle gives you a little heat and a  little red at time of tanning but a beautiful brown color tan as if you laid out all day by evening. No orange fake color. It may take a few times to get the quick dark but it is real and lasts not like the bronzers that are instant but orange on most people. Sorry to go on about orange but it just looks creepy in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is nice. Smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion but it is not for beginners. As my man says, it makes you feel like you are on fire if you have never used a tingle before. He is a red head really white skin and thought he could handle it. Shall we just say he refrains from a tingle at this point.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a must have for everyone looking to get a serious tan. I love the fact that this lotion will intensify the bronze and tan in just 1 session. This does have an medium/high tingle factor.. IT IS NOT FOR UNTANNED SKIN. Please have your base tan already established with well moisturized and hydrated skin prior to using GODDESS. I will continue using and repurchasing this one forever!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I love the tingle! Its perfect for me and my skin tone! I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  The smell is amazing, the consistency is great (not too thick, not too runny), the tingle is obvious but not overwhelming,  and there is no discoloration of the skin or hands after using. I&#x27;ve gone tanning and gotten dressed in a white tank afterwards, and even after sweating there was no stains on my clothing which I love!! Hate lotions that are too bronzey and leave your hands and clothes a brown tinge. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS LOTION! If you like tingle and no bronzer this is a great lotion I highly recommend. I&#x27;m buying another bottle when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> Bottled 3/2013. No tingle at all. Will use but wanted tingle.</li>
            <li> it is everything I expected. Love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  First lotion I&#x27;ve tried that compares to Goddess.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered a day early. Very happy with the quality. If you like goddess you&#x27;ll like this product. High tingle factor.. Very good for dark tan.</li>
