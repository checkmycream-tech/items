            <li>so I knew she had already smelled it and liked it</li>
            <li>I really liked the perfume.</li>
            <li>I can see why it won best new perfume of the year for 2014.  </li>

            <li>I love this small bottle, it fits perfectly in my purse!</li>
            <li>unsure if this parfume is the original.  </li>
            <li>It is not areal strong fragrance; kind of soft fragrance but not too sweet at all.  </li>
            <li>modern muse in  sample vial smelled much better than in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and clean scent</li>

            <li>try test sample first.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh yet the scent lasts a long time with just a quick spritz.  </li>
            <li>So beware very small bottle but same wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder Modern Muse Eau De Parfum Spray so much I want to purchase more, but can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon constantly will not accept my qualified, legal, paid-up Master Card to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;Please note, other computer sites and places always accept it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early and was exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It was helpful to be able to purchase a small size for my handbag.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large enough to keep me supplied with &amp;#34;Modern Muse&amp;#34; for a while.</li>
