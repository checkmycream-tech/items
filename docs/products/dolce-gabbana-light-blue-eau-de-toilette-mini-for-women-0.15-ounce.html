            <li> Really casual, and light.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mini for less than $10 to try out before spending Lord knows what on the big bottle.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle</li>
            <li> Seems the bottle was so small</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, i was tired of her using mine up evertime she visited.</li>
            <li> This crap was about as big as the tip of my pinky toe!</li>
            <li> I wore it twice and was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding it in the box.  </li>
            <li> and I paid $15 plus tax and shipping for this crap....</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love the travel size bottle....PERFECT size for traveling</li>
            <li> Out the three items i ordered that&#x27;s the only one i have yet to receice and im having difficultys getting a new one or credit to my account so therefore i cannot give a good rating</li>
            <li> I love it. It has a softer smell to it than the perfume. It&#x27;s perfect for on the go. I&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle but exactly what I was looking for to travel with.  I didn&#x27;t want to risk taking the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a free sample and it explicitly says this on the box. I made the mistake of getting it as a small gift for someone and now I look like I&#x27;m cheap! They need to list this in the sellers description.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume. Been wearing it about 5 years now and I get many good compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good product</li>
            <li> Seems the bottle was so small I had a difficult time finding it in the box.  For the price, I don&#x27;t believe it was all that fair, but I love this scent so I went for it.  This bottle cannot be used when traveling as it is not leak proof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset with this purchase.     When I received my package, I opened it up with excitement because I read the reviews on here, and I HAD to try it. However, When I opened my package, I saw that ALL the perfume had spilled out of the bottle. And, It wasn&#x27;t very fragrant.    What I did smell was nice, and good for a sunny day, with a nice breeze. Really casual, and light. However, It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to wear for the whole day, maybe not even 15 minutes! Very Disappointed. Maybe I&#x27;ll look for this again in the department store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, i was tired of her using mine up evertime she visited. If you like a more clean fresh scent, than this perfume is perfect!</li>
            <li> This crap was about as big as the tip of my pinky toe! and I paid $15 plus tax and shipping for this crap....I will never purchase from this particular seller again. The enormous box it came in was worth more than the itsy bitsy teeny weeny droplet of bottle of perfume it was!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. I ordered the sample to try it out.  This smelled nothing like the larger size bottles. I wore it twice and was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was for the price. Wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> Love this, was priced right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. I&#x27;m not thrilled, but not completely disappointed. I rather buy this in a store opposed to online.</li>
            <li> very good 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! It is definitely my new favorite. I ordered the mini for less than $10 to try out before spending Lord knows what on the big bottle. I love it so much... who cares what the big bottle costs... I am getting it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  You will love it! You only need a little dab and our goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Long lasting fresh scent. i will get it again.</li>
