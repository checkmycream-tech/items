            <li>CONAIR IS A GOOD, WELL-KNOWN BRAND.</li>
            <li>good to hold</li>
            <li>This was a gift from my granddaughter for Christmas she was absolutely delighted that there were three sizes</li>
            <li>good quality</li>
            <li>heats up in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Gran daughter loved it</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a while to find a good size</li>
            <li>My daughter loved them.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be good since they were from Conair.</li>
            <li>my curling irons arrived quicky an in good working condition&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them and got them for a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, I absolutely love these iron&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These work great love the product</li>
            <li>She is enjoying them a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Amazing price and of course,  as a Conair product, exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>I love shopping on Amazon !</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>But it does give amazing curls.</li>
            <li>but instead you get 3; makes a nice gift</li>
            <li>They take quite a bit to warm.</li>
            <li>Hair always comes out nice.</li>
            <li>Was very impressed with how fast they shipped.</li>
            <li>and as it warms I can do my make up or take a shower while waiting for it to warm.</li>
            <li>; CURLING TURNED INTO A NICE SURPRISE.  </li>
            <li>Now I will have what I need for hair in a handy 3-pack.</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li>They work great there is three different sizes which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Excellent brand new packaging!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, arrived fast, do what I need them to do, and the price is Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great to have a choice of what size to use right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li>I liked that they came in a variety pack because I do change my hair often, plus I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work best with my current style.  </li>
            <li>This is great but it takes a couple minutes to heat up but instead of using a clamp I use them as a wand to make pretty curls an</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get that hot, the sizes are great but not the highest quality curling irons.</li>
            <li>Very cheap feeling no temperature adjustment or on switch.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Product very cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>The curling irons are light weight and heat up quickly and do a great job of curling.</li>
            <li>My daughter love these curling irons.</li>
            <li>I ended up spending more than 15 $ because I had to buy a WORKING curling Iron...  </li>
            <li>Come to think of it, perhaps Conaire anticipated that this glittery grape purple set of curling irons would appeal most to tweens and teens and that&#x27;s why they are so underpowered.</li>
            <li>She will so love it when Christmas comes around.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use all three</li>
            <li>It is great deal also they work really well</li>
            <li>But a better one and one with temp adjuster.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li>ConAir has better</li>
            <li>I thought that the fact that they sold the curlers in a set, that it was more convenient since I didn&#x27;t want to buy curlers seperately.</li>
            <li>Gave them to my daughter and got better ones.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my grand daughter who models and couldn&#x27;t find her hair curling iron.</li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Good value and fun color.  </li>
            <li>Need to get hotter to hold a better curl.....</li>
            <li>she love it.</li>
            <li>I love these I use them as much as I can and they do great</li>
            <li>Okay for curling</li>
            <li>My wife love the set of curling iron.</li>
            <li>Over these are okay.</li>
            <li>I knew there wouldn&#x27;t be temperature control but not being able to turn it off</li>
            <li>I for sure give it a 5 star</li>
            <li>everithing works ok</li>
            <li>Just ok curling irons.</li>
            <li>but ok for a tween.</li>
            <li>If your hair is already curly or wavy this product is great for adding some more structure or calming frizz, but it doesnt work well on straight hair.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>he gonna love  this, and the prize you cant complain about it</li>
            <li>HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY</li>
            <li>BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!</li>
            <li>and I curl my hair more now because its easier to achieve.</li>
            <li>I love this set all you do is plug it in</li>
            <li>then the stores and it arrived fast and packaged great.</li>
            <li>The different sizes are awesome</li>
            <li>Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price plug in and there on nice and sturdy great for the hair dresser who keeps them hot all day</li>
            <li>Great product and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Pretty good curlers....  </li>
            <li>Nice handle, heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just</li>
            <li>These will all be going to Good Will and maybe work for someone without totally straight hair.</li>
            <li>That is always great since I am always looking to save a little cash but still have a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my little cousin learning how top do her hair...</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Works fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Best little curling irons I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>3 sizes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has three sized tools that are just perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>it felt cheap when i opened the package and after turning it</li>
            <li>cheap quality.</li>
            <li>The curling irons came in on date, I used all three within a few days and they work great!!</li>
            <li>No indicator light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have 3 different sizes and these have the grips to hold the hair while curling.</li>
            <li>It was a great price for 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason why the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Your standard curlers at a great price.</li>
            <li>I should have just bought the same model I knew worked great.  </li>
            <li>I only paid $20 for the three and am happy with them.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made with a flimsey plastic stand.</li>
            <li>Is a great starter kit as well for younger teens/tweens  just learning how to use them.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap and they do not get hit that quick and look and feel cheap</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I love the barrel sizes of the curling irons but the problem is they don&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li>does a great job on long hair</li>
            <li>I was really excited when theses came</li>
            <li>I was really excited about these curling irons</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Packaging was as it would be if purchased in a Brick and Mortar store - tamper proof, original Conair packaging.</li>
            <li>love them, just wish there was an on/off button, but nice to have different sizes.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s priced right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starter iron, which is why I bought it to try the different sizes</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and the various sizes are good.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter loves that she can change the size of the curls she wants in her hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good iron curlers to start learning with, or current replacements.</li>
            <li>The barrels are shorter than I may have wanted them but getting 3 for a cheap price made it worth buying.</li>
            <li>Such a good value.  </li>
            <li>Nice set for nearly all size curls</li>
            <li>dont listen to the other reviwes im telling you buy it its great and does the job</li>
            <li>Can not turn on and off , other than that great for the price</li>
            <li>I got what I paid for...an adequate set of curling irons.  </li>
            <li>Makes doing my hair quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Curling Iron Pack is an excellent investment and I am finding the three different sizes work so well for the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Super convenient that I got three for the price of one.</li>
            <li>did not get very hot at all.</li>
            <li>They love the new curling irons.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a curling iron, so I decided to try something inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>get warm enough to curl.</li>
            <li>and I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>These curlers are worth the money, I will recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>Nice to have 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li>As soon as I got it, I plugged it in and it got hot quickly</li>
            <li>.. bur they don&#x27;t seem to heat up quickly or stay hot.</li>
            <li>The triple pack value is great, but the curling irons are way too small.</li>
            <li>their okay the directions say a white light will come on when ready to style</li>
            <li>very cheap, barely gets hot.</li>
            <li>I got these three in a pack and only use the smallest one because I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>All three lack temperature settings and take a very long time to warm up.</li>
            <li>My girls dislike these curling irons very much.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, don&#x27;t heat well enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for 3 curling irons</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot so long term probably need a bit more power.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I have fine hair and with the finish on these my hair keeps slipping off before I get a good curl.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love that they are in a pack of three as you need different sizes around your head.</li>
            <li>For slightly more money buy the Vidal Sassoon set of three curling irons in similar sizes (if you can find them).</li>
            <li>They heat up faster and hotter, which probably stems from the fact that the wattage is higher.</li>
            <li>The handle gets too hot</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get as hot as a higher end</li>
            <li>all three irons don&#x27;t work and does not get hot</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you want curls to last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>i love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering something else, but this is exactly as described and does the job.  </li>
            <li>It became way 2 hot and doesn&#x27;t have a temp automatic switch</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the three different options for the size :)</li>
            <li>I love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a higher quality product</li>
            <li>The barrels don&#x27;t get terribly hot, which I wanted.</li>
            <li>The main downside to them is that they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, and there&#x27;s no off switch.  </li>
            <li>Typically have always used Conair and been very happy with the little bit more expensive models - the $9-12 range per iron which in my mind a great price.</li>
            <li>Okay, I do not generally write reviews, but after using this product I just had to write one.</li>
            <li>Good for beginners with thin hair like me as they dont get super hot!</li>
            <li>Bought two orders of these and they would not even heat up to warm much less hot.</li>
            <li>The curling iron gets hot really fast.</li>
            <li>(not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn&#x27;t an on/off switch</li>
            <li>The iron takes way too long to heat up and, even at full heat, does not get super hot.  </li>
            <li>but I needed a quick set to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>and I strongly suggest you not to make the same mistake I made.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get a worthy product.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking the fattest one is a large size, think again.</li>
            <li>and they certainly serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>work fine and are definitely a bargain.</li>
            <li>These all work fine, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve recently bought this product and I love it so far!</li>
            <li>However, the price is very low and the 1/2-inch iron I used today worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Lots of options with this set for a decent price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the equivalent of purchasing the \\&quot;child safe\\&quot; version of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for them.</li>
            <li>are very explanatory</li>
            <li>it doesnt heat that well and really doesnt curl</li>
            <li>I enjoy the handel and the short time it takes to heat up</li>
            <li>Which defeats the whole purpose of my purchase.</li>
            <li>does not heat very well</li>
            <li>they were cheap so didn&#x27;t send back</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t heat up very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have heat settings and don&#x27;t heat very well</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for my wife and she really likes them.</li>
            <li>but when i got them i was really dissapointed about the quality.when i got them i plugged them in and</li>
            <li>Much cheaper</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see 3 curling irons for only $15.</li>
            <li>I use the 2 larger sizes and curl my daughters hair for special occasions with the smallest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li>Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS IRON PACK.</li>
            <li>My favorite one is the middle size because it heats up the fastest and actually curls my hair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of trusting a name brand simply because you&#x27;ve had a good experience with a company&#x27;s products in the past.</li>
            <li>Worth buying every year, especially if you don&#x27;t have the money to drop on a Chi or something like that</li>
            <li>they dont get hot , yu have to plug them up for a long time in order for them to get hot and curly my hair</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough to really set it in</li>
            <li>Curling irons take SOO long to get hot, and even then they aren&#x27;t that hot.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have on/off switches and they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair quickly or with a lasting effect.</li>
            <li>This product nearly ruined my wedding because none of the curling irons heated adequately and, after 40+ minutes of struggling to no avail, had to be replaced before the stylist could work any further.</li>
            <li>The 3 different sizes make it so easy to curl the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li>This set was a great buy, a little heavy on the shipping.</li>
            <li>They take a really long time to heat up and they don&#x27;t even get very hot.</li>
            <li>So, I bought it when I was new at curling my hair, and didn&#x27;t know what sizes to get...</li>
            <li>If you were to move the cord around, the red light turns on and off, and it doesn&#x27;t get heated properly.</li>
            <li>No heat setting and don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl anything!</li>
            <li>They curl but don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>They do not get hot enough to curl their hair.</li>
            <li>Temperature never became hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I also feel it doesnt heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li>They do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even get hot enough.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>Did not get hot enough to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>No temperature controls and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>My cosmetology teacher bought these for our class, and they don&#x27;t even get hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn your hair.</li>
            <li>The curling irons I purchased don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The irons dont get hot enough to curl and there is no auto shut off.</li>
            <li>Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like and the cord is very short.</li>
            <li>Takes forever to heat up and still not hot enough to curl straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Not worth even $5, irons do not get hot!!</li>
            <li>I just need to be super careful about unplugging the device when done.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this wholly unanticipated problem, the ceremony started off much later than it should have!</li>
            <li>i would say that it takes too long to heat up and the temperature doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i would like</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re NOT heavy at all.</li>
            <li>She uses them in the mornings to get ready for work and likes that there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for their curler with the exchangeable wands of different sizes, but it seems they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought them for a young teenager for Christmas.</li>
            <li>but i order it camed early</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a young lady of 13 years old...</li>
            <li>I received it on time even early as I recall.  </li>
            <li>I use so much sculpting gel , mousse and hair spray after spending 3 hours doing my hair and only made it through like 2 hours of dinner the rest of the night</li>
            <li>They barely get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li>This may be ok for doing kids hair, but if you have thick hair forget it.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t get very hot and the barrel way to short for long hair.</li>
            <li>and i love how it let you have big curls or small ones</li>
            <li>They do not have a high and low  or off selection.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a high or low setting.</li>
            <li>The do not have a handle that you can set them up on, and no controls for high and low heat.</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>One heat and does not stay hot long enough</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is for everyday usage because of the pricing amount but for quick hair curls</li>
            <li>i recommend you preheating it half an hour earlier and put it at a position where the red light stays on.</li>
            <li>Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to create long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I tried using them on my hair and it barely curled, even after waiting forever for it to heat up.</li>
            <li>These curling irons barely have any heat at all.</li>
            <li>Just buy a nice expensive one.</li>
            <li>Poor quality, does not heat up well, OK for daughter to practice with...cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Was all excited to get three curling irons for just $12 -- too bad they take a loooong time to heat up, and even then they really aren&#x27;t hot enough.....would not recommend.</li>
            <li>However, if the purchaser is expecting a high temperature iron - consider other options.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because my hair is super thick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good to hold</li>

            <li> My daughter loved them.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Amazing price and of course,  as a Conair product, exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> I love shopping on Amazon !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> But it does give amazing curls.</li>
            <li> but instead you get 3; makes a nice gift</li>
            <li> They take quite a bit to warm.</li>
            <li> Hair always comes out nice.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with how fast they shipped.</li>
            <li> and as it warms I can do my make up or take a shower while waiting for it to warm.</li>
            <li> ; CURLING TURNED INTO A NICE SURPRISE.  </li>
            <li> Now I will have what I need for hair in a handy 3-pack.</li>
            <li> and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> They work great there is three different sizes which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent brand new packaging!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, arrived fast, do what I need them to do, and the price is Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great to have a choice of what size to use right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I liked that they came in a variety pack because I do change my hair often, plus I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work best with my current style.  </li>
            <li> This is great but it takes a couple minutes to heat up but instead of using a clamp I use them as a wand to make pretty curls an</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get that hot, the sizes are great but not the highest quality curling irons.</li>
            <li> Very cheap feeling no temperature adjustment or on switch.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Product very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> The curling irons are light weight and heat up quickly and do a great job of curling.</li>
            <li> My daughter love these curling irons.</li>
            <li> I ended up spending more than 15 $ because I had to buy a WORKING curling Iron...  </li>
            <li> Come to think of it, perhaps Conaire anticipated that this glittery grape purple set of curling irons would appeal most to tweens and teens and that&#x27;s why they are so underpowered.</li>
            <li> She will so love it when Christmas comes around.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use all three</li>
            <li> It is great deal also they work really well</li>
            <li> But a better one and one with temp adjuster.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li> ConAir has better</li>
            <li> I thought that the fact that they sold the curlers in a set, that it was more convenient since I didn&#x27;t want to buy curlers seperately.</li>
            <li> Gave them to my daughter and got better ones.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my grand daughter who models and couldn&#x27;t find her hair curling iron.</li>
            <li> i really love it</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Good value and fun color.  </li>
            <li> Need to get hotter to hold a better curl.....</li>
            <li> she love it.</li>
            <li> I love these I use them as much as I can and they do great</li>
            <li> Okay for curling</li>
            <li> My wife love the set of curling iron.</li>
            <li> Over these are okay.</li>
            <li> I knew there wouldn&#x27;t be temperature control but not being able to turn it off</li>
            <li> I for sure give it a 5 star</li>
            <li> everithing works ok</li>
            <li> Just ok curling irons.</li>
            <li> but ok for a tween.</li>
            <li> If your hair is already curly or wavy this product is great for adding some more structure or calming frizz, but it doesnt work well on straight hair.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li> he gonna love  this, and the prize you cant complain about it</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY</li>
            <li> BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!</li>
            <li> and I curl my hair more now because its easier to achieve.</li>
            <li> I love this set all you do is plug it in</li>
            <li> then the stores and it arrived fast and packaged great.</li>
            <li> The different sizes are awesome</li>
            <li> Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price plug in and there on nice and sturdy great for the hair dresser who keeps them hot all day</li>
            <li> Great product and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty good curlers....  </li>
            <li> Nice handle, heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just</li>
            <li> These will all be going to Good Will and maybe work for someone without totally straight hair.</li>
            <li> That is always great since I am always looking to save a little cash but still have a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little cousin learning how top do her hair...</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> Works fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Best little curling irons I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> 3 sizes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has three sized tools that are just perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> it felt cheap when i opened the package and after turning it</li>
            <li> cheap quality.</li>
            <li> The curling irons came in on date, I used all three within a few days and they work great!!</li>
            <li> No indicator light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have 3 different sizes and these have the grips to hold the hair while curling.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Your standard curlers at a great price.</li>
            <li> I should have just bought the same model I knew worked great.  </li>
            <li> I only paid $20 for the three and am happy with them.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made with a flimsey plastic stand.</li>
            <li> Is a great starter kit as well for younger teens/tweens  just learning how to use them.</li>
            <li> but they are cheap and they do not get hit that quick and look and feel cheap</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the barrel sizes of the curling irons but the problem is they don&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li> does a great job on long hair</li>
            <li> I was really excited when theses came</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these curling irons</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Packaging was as it would be if purchased in a Brick and Mortar store - tamper proof, original Conair packaging.</li>
            <li> love them, just wish there was an on/off button, but nice to have different sizes.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s priced right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter iron, which is why I bought it to try the different sizes</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and the various sizes are good.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves that she can change the size of the curls she wants in her hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good iron curlers to start learning with, or current replacements.</li>
            <li> The barrels are shorter than I may have wanted them but getting 3 for a cheap price made it worth buying.</li>
            <li> Such a good value.  </li>
            <li> Nice set for nearly all size curls</li>
            <li> dont listen to the other reviwes im telling you buy it its great and does the job</li>
            <li> Can not turn on and off , other than that great for the price</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for...an adequate set of curling irons.  </li>
            <li> Makes doing my hair quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Curling Iron Pack is an excellent investment and I am finding the three different sizes work so well for the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Super convenient that I got three for the price of one.</li>
            <li> did not get very hot at all.</li>
            <li> They love the new curling irons.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a curling iron, so I decided to try something inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> get warm enough to curl.</li>
            <li> and I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> These curlers are worth the money, I will recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice to have 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it, I plugged it in and it got hot quickly</li>
            <li> .. bur they don&#x27;t seem to heat up quickly or stay hot.</li>
            <li> The triple pack value is great, but the curling irons are way too small.</li>
            <li> their okay the directions say a white light will come on when ready to style</li>
            <li> very cheap, barely gets hot.</li>
            <li> I got these three in a pack and only use the smallest one because I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> All three lack temperature settings and take a very long time to warm up.</li>
            <li> My girls dislike these curling irons very much.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, don&#x27;t heat well enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for 3 curling irons</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot so long term probably need a bit more power.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have fine hair and with the finish on these my hair keeps slipping off before I get a good curl.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love that they are in a pack of three as you need different sizes around your head.</li>
            <li> For slightly more money buy the Vidal Sassoon set of three curling irons in similar sizes (if you can find them).</li>
            <li> They heat up faster and hotter, which probably stems from the fact that the wattage is higher.</li>
            <li> The handle gets too hot</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as a higher end</li>
            <li> all three irons don&#x27;t work and does not get hot</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you want curls to last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> i love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering something else, but this is exactly as described and does the job.  </li>
            <li> It became way 2 hot and doesn&#x27;t have a temp automatic switch</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the three different options for the size :)</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a higher quality product</li>
            <li> The barrels don&#x27;t get terribly hot, which I wanted.</li>
            <li> The main downside to them is that they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, and there&#x27;s no off switch.  </li>
            <li> Typically have always used Conair and been very happy with the little bit more expensive models - the $9-12 range per iron which in my mind a great price.</li>
            <li> Okay, I do not generally write reviews, but after using this product I just had to write one.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners with thin hair like me as they dont get super hot!</li>
            <li> Bought two orders of these and they would not even heat up to warm much less hot.</li>
            <li> The curling iron gets hot really fast.</li>
            <li> (not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn&#x27;t an on/off switch</li>
            <li> The iron takes way too long to heat up and, even at full heat, does not get super hot.  </li>
            <li> but I needed a quick set to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> and I strongly suggest you not to make the same mistake I made.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more to get a worthy product.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking the fattest one is a large size, think again.</li>
            <li> and they certainly serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> work fine and are definitely a bargain.</li>
            <li> These all work fine, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve recently bought this product and I love it so far!</li>
            <li> However, the price is very low and the 1/2-inch iron I used today worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Lots of options with this set for a decent price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the equivalent of purchasing the \\&quot;child safe\\&quot; version of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for them.</li>
            <li> are very explanatory</li>
            <li> it doesnt heat that well and really doesnt curl</li>
            <li> I enjoy the handel and the short time it takes to heat up</li>
            <li> Which defeats the whole purpose of my purchase.</li>
            <li> does not heat very well</li>
            <li> they were cheap so didn&#x27;t send back</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t heat up very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have heat settings and don&#x27;t heat very well</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my wife and she really likes them.</li>
            <li> but when i got them i was really dissapointed about the quality.when i got them i plugged them in and</li>
            <li> Much cheaper</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see 3 curling irons for only $15.</li>
            <li> I use the 2 larger sizes and curl my daughters hair for special occasions with the smallest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li> Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS IRON PACK.</li>
            <li> My favorite one is the middle size because it heats up the fastest and actually curls my hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of trusting a name brand simply because you&#x27;ve had a good experience with a company&#x27;s products in the past.</li>
            <li> Worth buying every year, especially if you don&#x27;t have the money to drop on a Chi or something like that</li>
            <li> they dont get hot , yu have to plug them up for a long time in order for them to get hot and curly my hair</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough to really set it in</li>
            <li> Curling irons take SOO long to get hot, and even then they aren&#x27;t that hot.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have on/off switches and they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair quickly or with a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> This product nearly ruined my wedding because none of the curling irons heated adequately and, after 40+ minutes of struggling to no avail, had to be replaced before the stylist could work any further.</li>
            <li> The 3 different sizes make it so easy to curl the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li> This set was a great buy, a little heavy on the shipping.</li>
            <li> They take a really long time to heat up and they don&#x27;t even get very hot.</li>
            <li> So, I bought it when I was new at curling my hair, and didn&#x27;t know what sizes to get...</li>
            <li> If you were to move the cord around, the red light turns on and off, and it doesn&#x27;t get heated properly.</li>
            <li> No heat setting and don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl anything!</li>
            <li> They curl but don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> They do not get hot enough to curl their hair.</li>
            <li> Temperature never became hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I also feel it doesnt heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li> They do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even get hot enough.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> No temperature controls and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> My cosmetology teacher bought these for our class, and they don&#x27;t even get hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn your hair.</li>
            <li> The curling irons I purchased don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The irons dont get hot enough to curl and there is no auto shut off.</li>
            <li> Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like and the cord is very short.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up and still not hot enough to curl straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Not worth even $5, irons do not get hot!!</li>
            <li> I just need to be super careful about unplugging the device when done.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this wholly unanticipated problem, the ceremony started off much later than it should have!</li>
            <li> i would say that it takes too long to heat up and the temperature doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i would like</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re NOT heavy at all.</li>
            <li> She uses them in the mornings to get ready for work and likes that there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for their curler with the exchangeable wands of different sizes, but it seems they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought them for a young teenager for Christmas.</li>
            <li> but i order it camed early</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a young lady of 13 years old...</li>
            <li> I received it on time even early as I recall.  </li>
            <li> I use so much sculpting gel , mousse and hair spray after spending 3 hours doing my hair and only made it through like 2 hours of dinner the rest of the night</li>
            <li> They barely get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li> This may be ok for doing kids hair, but if you have thick hair forget it.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get very hot and the barrel way to short for long hair.</li>
            <li> and i love how it let you have big curls or small ones</li>
            <li> They do not have a high and low  or off selection.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a high or low setting.</li>
            <li> The do not have a handle that you can set them up on, and no controls for high and low heat.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> One heat and does not stay hot long enough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is for everyday usage because of the pricing amount but for quick hair curls</li>
            <li> i recommend you preheating it half an hour earlier and put it at a position where the red light stays on.</li>
            <li> Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to create long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I tried using them on my hair and it barely curled, even after waiting forever for it to heat up.</li>
            <li> These curling irons barely have any heat at all.</li>
            <li> Just buy a nice expensive one.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, does not heat up well, OK for daughter to practice with...cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Was all excited to get three curling irons for just $12 -- too bad they take a loooong time to heat up, and even then they really aren&#x27;t hot enough.....would not recommend.</li>
            <li> However, if the purchaser is expecting a high temperature iron - consider other options.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because my hair is super thick</li>
            <li> but they do not get hot enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It never got hot and would not curl hair in the least.  </li>
            <li> Usually, curling irons that work for people with straight hair never seem to work for my hair.</li>
            <li> While attend beauty school she come in contact with ladies that have long and short hair.</li>
            <li> Irons still work though,  they just won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My hair was so flat all the time.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use it because I really don&#x27;t have much time on my hands to waste on this!</li>
            <li> Although the long heat up time.</li>
            <li> it takes too long to heat</li>
            <li> I could not resist buying these 3 curling irons even though I only needed/wanted the largest one because ALL 3 cost less than just ONE at our local CVS and beauty product stores.  </li>
            <li> However, not hot enough for curls to stay.</li>
            <li> I use the big curl one for the back of my hair, the middle one goes for the sides, and then the small one goes for the front.</li>
            <li> Mine will not hold a curl for very long (if at all) when I use these irons.  </li>
            <li> This set of curling irons will make you crazy especially if you intend to use them in preparation for an important event.</li>
            <li> this product did not live up to the expectations i would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Recommend purchasing a single well made curling iron.</li>
            <li> I wish I could send these back, but I found out a little too late that they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> but these products are actually pretty poor.</li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t even manage to get a loose wave out of it.</li>
            <li> You get three different for less than the price of one.  </li>
            <li> 3 days later it was advertised on Amazon for $4 less.  </li>
            <li> it dont take long to heat up like other say</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all will not curl my 6 year olds hair and hers is very thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the curl is very VERY loose regardless of what size I use.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> Not very practical for use.</li>
            <li> not at all what i expected from the description on line i returned it pronto</li>
            <li> my hair was normal and straight as always I thought my hair was just impossible</li>
            <li> You have to hold each curl at least twenty seconds which is twice as long as my last curling iron.</li>
            <li> If these had been more expensive, I would have returned them based on the fact that the photo is not a good representation.</li>
            <li> Worth for what we paid for them take a very long time to heat up and awkward to use</li>
            <li> The curlers received were less than satisfactory due to the way the clip is so loose it doesn&#x27;t hold hair to the curly.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my desk at work and the other two at home.</li>
            <li> These are only on if plugged in and off when unplugged, not exactly safe.</li>
            <li> when i read other people  reviwes i thought that this was going to be some s</li>
            <li> So maybe this iron is the opposite of the usual.</li>
            <li> I had to learn the hard way that not all Conaire products are created equally.</li>
            <li> This takes forever to be heated and it does not have a gage to turn up or down the heat level.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, they took up much less space.</li>
            <li> I use it for a slight bend to enhance volume.</li>
            <li> Very slow Heat up time and heat intensity was not hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> is not cool.</li>
            <li> do not true the seller at all.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> and I have thick long hair</li>
            <li> When I went to use it, the iron clamped so tight that it almost stuck to my hair.</li>
            <li> They do not have a tight grip &amp; your hair falls out while trying to curl it.  </li>
            <li> Then, one day, I after curling a little portion of my hair, I discovered dusts on the iron..</li>
            <li> It was pure disappointment</li>
            <li> SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Returned the item and got a refund within a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some curling irons that were so heavy they strained my wrists.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND A SHAME FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK.</li>
            <li> AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK</li>
            <li> Waste of my  money on these would not recommend buying this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> bad product they dont get hot at all</li>
            <li> It was a BIG waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe how bad this product really was.  </li>
            <li> and I actually feel sorry for whoever buys them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> All three gave me the same lame &amp;#34;spiral&amp;#34; or just didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Fills my need for the small curling iron</li>
            <li> Not sure if it turns off after sometime, I wouldn&#x27;t chance it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Since I hate to go get my hair cut, I like that i can curl it when it is short (just after a haricut or long -- a few months late)</li>
            <li> Look on the barrel of the curling iron for the WATTAGE (it will be hard to read</li>
            <li> sizes were ones I wanted, but they have no off and on button, and are hard to use</li>
            <li> The hardly heat up at all.</li>
            <li> The curling iron loses heat while in use.  </li>
            <li> but these were somewhat disappointing especially not having a heat adjustment button, which it says it has and the picture shows a button...</li>
            <li> Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t curl with any iron because how thick it is but these worked wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> but I mean I just wish I knew what to do the directions</li>
            <li> Plus they were not super expensive.</li>
            <li> These are horrible and don&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> When they heat up the glue melts and broke it was the same for all three wards they so bad the smell of burning hair too</li>
            <li> sorry i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> Was truly disappointed as I paid for the item advertised; but received a different style which is of no use to me, made a complaint but never got an acknowledgement from the supplier.</li>
            <li> The clips are weak.</li>
            <li> Too weak for my hair.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product</li>
            <li> Sucked I have thin hair</li>
            <li> While it may give you 3 sizes of irons, they are poor quality and now I have to find another one.  </li>
            <li> Poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Irons were outdated.</li>
            <li> And on using the other 2, I have noticed that it was a bad purchase</li>
            <li> have even used them to curl my fall (be careful when curling artificial hair pieces!)</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought them.</li>
            <li> no on off switch, these were crap, sent them back, my bad for not reading the description</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> and when it finally does it does the worst curl on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very poor products.</li>
            <li> Heats very poorly</li>
            <li> Terrible product, not worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> it was a gift and got bad reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that there are no settings but on and off.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t curl my hair :(</li>
            <li> BUT THERE CRAP</li>
            <li> Keeps me from having a bad hair day!</li>
            <li> Brutal.</li>

            <li> The curlers received were less than satisfactory due to the way the clip is so loose it doesn&#x27;t hold hair to the curly. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> You get three different for less than the price of one.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Not worth even $5, irons do not get hot!! Tried all 3 couldn&#x27;t even get a wave in my hair! Horrible</li>
            <li> Junk, just junk. No heat setting and don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl anything! I&#x27;m sorry I bought them.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars. I learned a valuable lesson in &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I did not buy these curling irons on amazon.com but I did buy them at Wal-mart. I was so excited to see 3 curling irons for only $15. When I went to use it, the iron clamped so tight that it almost stuck to my hair. When I went to take the curling iron out of the curl I had no choice but to literally pull it out, ripping out some hair. Also, leaving it with 0 curl. And it wasn&#x27;t like this was a problem with just one of them… all three of them had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I donated them to Good Will and I actually feel sorry for whoever buys them. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter love these curling irons. While attend beauty school she come in contact with ladies that have long and short hair. So this set of three curling irons was a perfect gift for her.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to heat. Up</li>
            <li> Awesome value for the price of one but instead you get 3; makes a nice gift</li>
            <li> Great recieved in time frame provided</li>
            <li> Do not like these at all.  They do not have a tight grip &amp; your hair falls out while trying to curl it.  Also these take FOREVER to heat up.  I would not recommend or buy again.  Terrible product, not worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> They curl but don&#x27;t get hot enough. They only have one temperature setting.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Very cheap feeling no temperature adjustment or on switch. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Love that they are in a pack of three as you need different sizes around your head.</li>
            <li> A damn good deal.. I love shopping on Amazon !</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066YC34/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title  It works fine my problem is that it doesn&#x27;t have and on and off switch, you just have to plug it on to use and unplug when finish but then again you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this yesterday after I warned her not to however she did purchase it and I cannot believe how bad this product really was.  It never got hot and would not curl hair in the least.  It was a BIG waste of money!!!! My advice is to put more money into it and purchase a better product!!!</li>
            <li> They suck! Don&#x27;t heat up at all</li>
            <li> They barely get hot enough to curl. Brutal.</li>
            <li> No settings.  One heat and does not stay hot long enough</li>
            <li> So, I bought it when I was new at curling my hair, and didn&#x27;t know what sizes to get... I ended up spending more than 15 $ because I had to buy a WORKING curling Iron...  It doesn&#x27;t work; I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought then...  Lo compre cuando era nueva con los rulos, y no sabía que tamaño comprar... termine gastando más dinero porque tuve que comprar otra que si funcionara.  No funciona, ojala nunca lo hubiera comprado.</li>
            <li> not work it for human hair.</li>
            <li> My girls dislike these curling irons very much. They do not get hot enough to curl their hair. Very poor products.</li>
            <li> Love them and got them for a great price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what i expected,you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter iron, which is why I bought it to try the different sizes but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot so long term probably need a bit more power. But it&#x27;s priced right!</li>
            <li> I could not resist buying these 3 curling irons even though I only needed/wanted the largest one because ALL 3 cost less than just ONE at our local CVS and beauty product stores.  However, you get what you pay for.  The iron takes way too long to heat up and, even at full heat, does not get super hot.  As a result, it doesn&#x27;t actually curl hair well.  Mine will not hold a curl for very long (if at all) when I use these irons.  I&#x27;d advise spending the extra money for a better-quality curling iron.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! Temperature never became hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> The triple pack value is great, but the curling irons are way too small. The handles are hardly big enough for my hands. Threw out the packaging, so I will just donate the curling irons.</li>
            <li> This takes forever to be heated and it does not have a gage to turn up or down the heat level. I hardly use it because I really don&#x27;t have much time on my hands to waste on this!</li>
            <li> bad product they dont get hot at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of trusting a name brand simply because you&#x27;ve had a good experience with a company&#x27;s products in the past. I had to learn the hard way that not all Conaire products are created equally. This product nearly ruined my wedding because none of the curling irons heated adequately and, after 40+ minutes of struggling to no avail, had to be replaced before the stylist could work any further. Thanks to this wholly unanticipated problem, the ceremony started off much later than it should have! For slightly more money buy the Vidal Sassoon set of three curling irons in similar sizes (if you can find them). They heat up faster and hotter, which probably stems from the fact that the wattage is higher. A curling iron has only one function; it&#x27;s not rocket science. This set of curling irons will make you crazy especially if you intend to use them in preparation for an important event. TIP: Look on the barrel of the curling iron for the WATTAGE (it will be hard to read but it&#x27;s there). Avoid the lower wattage versions. It&#x27;s the equivalent of purchasing the \\&quot;child safe\\&quot; version of the real thing. Come to think of it, perhaps Conaire anticipated that this glittery grape purple set of curling irons would appeal most to tweens and teens and that&#x27;s why they are so underpowered. In any event, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;you\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not your hair. It&#x27;s the product. It doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> sizes were ones I wanted, but they have no off and on button, and are hard to use</li>
            <li> love them, just wish there was an on/off button, but nice to have different sizes.</li>
            <li> Awful, did not even turn on.</li>
            <li> i like it but my only issue i would say that it takes too long to heat up and the temperature doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i would like but its still a gd product</li>
            <li> Good quality and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice handle, heats quickly.  They do not have a high and low  or off selection.  Probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the description on Amazon. The curling irons were supposed to have an \\&quot;On/Off\\&quot; switch AND variable heat settings. There was no heat setting or On/OFF switch. Also..when I ordered the item it was one price and 3 days later it was advertised on Amazon for $4 less.  Returned the item and got a refund within a few days.</li>
            <li> great set of curling irons at a great price</li>
            <li> Lots of options with this set for a decent price!</li>
            <li> no on off switch, these were crap, sent them back, my bad for not reading the description closely you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The handle gets too hot</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it, I plugged it in and it got hot quickly and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my daughter!!!! She will so love it when Christmas comes around. Thank you so much for them.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough. Don&#x27;t have a high or low setting. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Best little curling irons I&#x27;ve ever bought. They&#x27;re NOT heavy at all. I&#x27;ve had some curling irons that were so heavy they strained my wrists. The sizes are perfect too.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a curling iron, so I decided to try something inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work fine and are definitely a bargain. They don&#x27;t get as hot as a higher end iron would so you have to let it sit longer before releasing the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 sizes are fantastic. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use all three but I do. I use the 2 larger sizes and curl my daughters hair for special occasions with the smallest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li> Great Value. I keep one in my desk at work and the other two at home.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Awful!!! They don&#x27;t heat up enough.. Won&#x27;t curl at all! Straight to the trash can after destroying package to get them out.</li>
            <li> Bought two orders of these and they would not even heat up to warm much less hot. Should have returned them but time has elapsed.  Bought the second pack of them for my daughter but she didn&#x27;t need them. Awful quality and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is great deal also they work really well and I also like the fact they are different sizes</li>
            <li> This set was a great buy, a little heavy on the shipping. It has three sized tools that are just perfect for everyday use. I gave them as a gift and my sister loves them. She uses them all the time with no problems.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> With the different sizes, you have choices on the curl you want.</li>
            <li> Very small, doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Poor quality product</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for with this product. I also feel it doesnt heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li> Good price, but there is no on/off switch. With kids, that&#x27;s essential! I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the description about a switch...because there isn&#x27;t one. Sizes are great and they heat well</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift to my wife and she loves them! She uses them in the mornings to get ready for work and likes that there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and the various sizes are good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. They do not get hot enough. This may be ok for doing kids hair, but if you have thick hair forget it. But a better one and one with temp adjuster. These are only on if plugged in and off when unplugged, not exactly safe.</li>
            <li> Sucked I have thin hair and i couldn&#x27;t even manage to get a loose wave out of it. Worst thing ever</li>
            <li> These curling irons don&#x27;t curl one&#x27;s hair.  What a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron pack. It helps to have the different sizes so that I can do different hair styles with each one. The curling irons are light weight and heat up quickly and do a great job of curling. Plus they were not super expensive. That is always great since I am always looking to save a little cash but still have a good quality product.</li>
            <li> I did not like these curlers at all.  They did not heat up enough and they just did not work.  The only reason I did not send them back is because I destroyed the package (will never do that again).  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even get hot enough. But they gave me a refund</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for...an adequate set of curling irons.  I liked that they came in a variety pack because I do change my hair often, plus I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work best with my current style.  The main downside to them is that they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, and there&#x27;s no off switch.  But they do work well enough, they&#x27;re not defective in any way, they&#x27;re just not the best.</li>
            <li> this product did not live up to the expectations i would not buy it again. it felt cheap when i opened the package and after turning it i i realized it truly was. sorry i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know you have to plug in every time you use it!</li>
            <li> Lower end of the curling products. I&#x27;ve used better but I needed a quick set to replace my old one. ConAir has better</li>
            <li> I love the barrel sizes of the curling irons but the problem is they don&#x27;t get hot at all.  all three irons don&#x27;t work and does not get hot</li>
            <li> Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to create long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> They take quite a bit to warm. I bought these as a replacement for another Conair curler I&#x27;d had for 20 yrs that had begun to rust. I was really looking for their curler with the exchangeable wands of different sizes, but it seems they don&#x27;t make it anymore. It&#x27;s a shame, they took up much less space.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because my hair is super thick but these just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. All three gave me the same lame &amp;#34;spiral&amp;#34; or just didn&#x27;t work... doesn&#x27;t get hot enough I don&#x27;t think. I wouldn&#x27;t let a friend buy these.</li>
            <li> I thought that the fact that they sold the curlers in a set, that it was more convenient since I didn&#x27;t want to buy curlers seperately. They didn&#x27;t work too well though. If you were to move the cord around, the red light turns on and off, and it doesn&#x27;t get heated properly. If you buy it i recommend you preheating it half an hour earlier and put it at a position where the red light stays on.</li>
            <li> Works good for the price. Hair always comes out nice. Four stars; would be three because they burned after the second or third day and I can&#x27;t wash it off,  but the fact that they&#x27;re $11.99 here and $21.99 in my neighborhood beauty supply store gives it another star.  Irons still work though,  they just won&#x27;t last long. I should know,  this is my second set. Last one lasted about a year,  although those never burned Hmmm... Anyways, you get what you pay for.  Worth buying every year, especially if you don&#x27;t have the money to drop on a Chi or something like that</li>
            <li> cheap quality. Gave them to my daughter and got better ones.</li>
            <li> The curling iron loses heat while in use.  I only get about 1/2 of my hair curled before I need to stop and let curling iron heat up again. Additionally, the curl is very VERY loose regardless of what size I use.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t match photos. Item does not have an on/off switch nor does it adjust temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does get warm enough to curl. However, not hot enough for curls to stay. I gave two stars b/c I still use them in spite of the inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you want curls to last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my grand daughter who models and couldn&#x27;t find her hair curling iron. Was very impressed with how fast they shipped. My grand daughter loves that she can change the size of the curls she wants in her hair. Amazing price and of course,  as a Conair product, exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price. I bought them for a young teenager for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. All three lack temperature settings and take a very long time to warm up. I thought I was getting a great deal but these products are actually pretty poor.</li>
            <li> I received this item on time and it works great. The 3 barrel choices gave me plenty of options for creating hairstyles and curl volume.</li>
            <li> The price on this set of curling irons couldn&#x27;t be beat,but you get what you pay for. They don&#x27;t have on/off switches and they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair quickly or with a lasting effect. You have to hold each curl at least twenty seconds which is twice as long as my last curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is great but it takes a couple minutes to heat up but instead of using a clamp I use them as a wand to make pretty curls an I have extremely thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> perfect price. all 3 curling irons. i love the different sizes. they work perfect, conair is a good brand. great price.</li>
            <li> The curling irons came in on date, I used all three within a few days and they work great!! Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t curl with any iron because how thick it is but these worked wonders on my hair! It doesn&#x27;t have a temp setting or a on/off button which works perfect for me because I just plug it in and as it warms I can do my make up or take a shower while waiting for it to warm. It&#x27;s a great deal, I absolutely love these iron&#x27;s. Five Star definitely.</li>
            <li> when i read other people  reviwes i thought that this was going to be some s*** but i order it camed early and i tried it and it was great it dont take long to heat up like other say and i love how it let you have big curls or small ones i really love it i brought it on amazon prime dont listen to the other reviwes im telling you buy it its great and does the job</li>
            <li> These all work fine, especially for the money. I just wish it had a temperature control. They curl well and I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS IRON PACK. I got mine a while ago and they don&#x27;t hold my curls AT ALL. It was pure disappointment and I strongly suggest you not to make the same mistake I made. I&#x27;d give it 0 star if I could. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> These work, but not as well as Revlon and others.  The do not have a handle that you can set them up on, and no controls for high and low heat.</li>
            <li> their okay the directions say a white light will come on when ready to style but it never comes on so I guess their okay but I mean I just wish I knew what to do the directions are very explanatory</li>
            <li> Horrible. Doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all will not curl my 6 year olds hair and hers is very thin.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners with thin hair like me as they dont get super hot!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before I ordered.  No on/off switch, no temperature controls.  Not very practical for use.</li>
            <li> These work great love the product</li>
            <li> it doesnt heat that well and really doesnt curl i would not order it again it was a gift and got bad reviews</li>
            <li> I only use 1/2 inch, but passed 3/4 inch and 1 inch to others who use. Works fine for the price.</li>
            <li> works great I enjoy the handel and the short time it takes to heat up does a great job on long hair</li>
            <li> A XMAS LIST REQUEST FOR A 3/4&amp;#34; CURLING TURNED INTO A NICE SURPRISE.  A GOOD PRICE FOR ALL THREE SIZES 1/2, 3/4, AND 1 INCH.  ALL WORK WELL.  CONAIR IS A GOOD, WELL-KNOWN BRAND.</li>
            <li> When they heat up the glue melts and broke it was the same for all three wards they so bad the smell of burning hair too</li>
            <li> The curling irons do not curl my hair. Which defeats the whole purpose of my purchase. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does the job when I need to in between trips to the beauty salon. Keeps me from having a bad hair day!</li>
            <li> excellent product fulfills all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;recommend their quality is very good and the price even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying him his sevice and attention no comparison.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all. Irons were outdated. Very slow Heat up time and heat intensity was not hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Good value and fun color.  All options covered here, I would have never thought to try the larger size but this set offered the chance.</li>
            <li> Excellent! The curling iron gets hot really fast.</li>
            <li> Not enough heat at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because Conair products are usually great but these were somewhat disappointing especially not having a heat adjustment button, which it says it has and the picture shows a button... Quite disappointed. It did not heat as well as I would like either and since I opened it, it&#x27;s no longer eligible for send back.</li>
            <li> These curlers are worth the money, I will recommend these to anyone. The 3 different sizes make it so easy to curl the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good curlers....  Need to get hotter to hold a better curl.....</li>
            <li> I have relevantly short hair but it&#x27;s good iron curlers to start learning with, or current replacements.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a young lady of 13 years old...she love it.</li>
            <li> These are horrible and don&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, don&#x27;t heat well enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li> Great I love these I use them as much as I can and they do great</li>
            <li> excellent quality and temperature to made the curl !!&lt;br /&gt;arrive on time&lt;br /&gt;and good to hold</li>
            <li> I  needed all three sizes of curling iron as my hair is getting longer. The only thing is I have fine hair and with the finish on these my hair keeps slipping off before I get a good curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has so many bad reviews. Honestly I&#x27;ve recently bought this product and I love it so far! Although the long heat up time. Resolve that by doing everything else after plugging the iron in. Ex: wake up, plug in iron. While the iron is heating up brush teeth, get dressed, take a shower, etc. by the time you&#x27;re finished with that your iron is good to go!</li>
            <li> The item is affordable for the set of three. However, if the purchaser is expecting a high temperature iron - consider other options.</li>
            <li> does not heat very well</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little cousin learning how top do her hair...</li>
            <li> not at all what i expected from the description on line i returned it pronto</li>
            <li> Okay for curling but they are cheap and they do not get hit that quick and look and feel cheap</li>
            <li> Disappointed that there are no settings but on and off. Cannot control the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Worth for what we paid for them take a very long time to heat up and awkward to use</li>
            <li> As advertised - no complaints.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering something else, but this is exactly as described and does the job.  I am happy with this purchase, and it was  a great price.  Since I hate to go get my hair cut, I like that i can curl it when it is short (just after a haricut or long -- a few months late)</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get very hot and the barrel way to short for long hair. they were cheap so didn&#x27;t send back</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  No indicator light.  No on and off switch.  Not up to the standard of the Conair products I am use to.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my granddaughter for Christmas she was absolutely delighted that there were three sizes she said she even share one with her mom</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, they are using them and seem to like the different sizes. It is great for the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect and perfect sizes. I like the ones with teeth but it tangles my hair. Now I have the perfect size for my coiffure!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price plug in and there on nice and sturdy great for the hair dresser who keeps them hot all day</li>
            <li> What a TERRIFIC set!  Sometimes a person needs a different size curling iron, and this set give you three options.  I bought it to keep at my daughter&#x27;s house where I visit and stay often.  Now I will have what I need for hair in a handy 3-pack.</li>
            <li> I wish I could send these back, but I found out a little too late that they don&#x27;t really work. Opened the package, brought them on a trip and they don&#x27;t heat up or shut off automatically. Just buy a nice expensive one.</li>
            <li> The clips are weak. The heat element is unreliable. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Bought these curling irons as a gift for our daughter.  She is enjoying them a great deal.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Okay, I do not generally write reviews, but after using this product I just had to write one. I got this curling iron almost 2months back, on December 2012. The curler doesn&#x27;t curl, it makes circles in your hair. Then, one day, I after curling a little portion of my hair, I discovered dusts on the iron.. and yes... it was my hair, burned !!  IT BURNED MY HAIR !! It burned my bed sheet too. And I just noticed that my iron does not have any auto turn off. There is no switch to turn it off or to lower the temperature as it is shown in the picture. DO NOT BUY IT !! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND A SHAME FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> they dont get hot , yu have to plug them up for a long time in order for them to get hot and curly my hair</li>
            <li> My friend just wanted a larger curling iron however, I got her this three pack for the price of one and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> How nice to get three for the price of one! Since they all match, they can hang in my bathroom when not in use and look coordinated. It&#x27;s really great to have a choice of what size to use right at my fingertips. Makes doing my hair quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;I have even used them to curl my fall (be careful when curling artificial hair pieces!)</li>
            <li> Curling Iron Pack is an excellent investment and I am finding the three different sizes work so well for the different lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pack of curling irons and determined that I really only needed the smallest barrel iron., so I shared with my granddaughters. They love the new curling irons. This product made three people happy.</li>
            <li> I have the opposite problem with them... it burnt my hair!!!! It became way 2 hot and doesn&#x27;t have a temp automatic switch and so as I was doing my hair I suddenly found that the curl wrapped around it burnt and it came of as I was trying to unwrap it</li>
            <li> They work great there is three different sizes which is awesome.</li>
            <li> No problems here! Quick delivery! Excellent brand new packaging! My daughter loves the three different options for the size :)</li>
            <li> My wife love the set of curling iron.</li>
            <li> There is no on/off switch so you need to plug and unplug..not good. Also, no temperature adjustment.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my nieces birthday!  Arrived on time,  quality product and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The rolling drums are too short and these don&#x27;t work well with voluminous hair. Over these are okay.</li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I didnt know there wasn&#x27;t temperature control. Too weak for my hair. Curls fall out.</li>
            <li> There are no on/off switches on these. I knew there wouldn&#x27;t be temperature control but not being able to turn it off is not cool.</li>
            <li> I for sure give it a 5 star</li>
            <li> No temperature controls and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have 3 different sizes and these have the grips to hold the hair while curling.</li>
            <li> Horrible do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Was all excited to get three curling irons for just $12 -- too bad they take a loooong time to heat up, and even then they really aren&#x27;t hot enough.....would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair !!!</li>
            <li> The recipient of this gift was very happy with it. She has already experimented with the different sizes and has her daughter begging her to curl her hair. Nice to have 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> My hair was so flat all the time.  The different sizes gives me control over how I want to look each day.  They just work great.  I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, does not heat up well, OK for daughter to practice with...cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy if you want or need heat to curl your hair</li>
            <li> I was really excited when theses came but they take forever to heat up and they don&#x27;t curl my hair :(</li>
            <li> This was the perfect price to get all 3 irons and all of them worked. I used them for my wedding hair style and did not have any issues.</li>
            <li> good quality everithing works ok</li>
            <li> I like having a variety of barrel sizes.  However, I wish I could control the heat settings.  The irons are either on or off and they take a while to realy heat up.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t heat up very well. It was a great price for 3 different sizes. My pre-teen likes them enough to keep</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but doesn&#x27;t work best with my hair type. Over all it was a great expirience for online shopping.</li>
            <li> no temp control on the</li>
            <li> Just ok curling irons. Don&#x27;t have heat settings and don&#x27;t heat very well but ok for a tween.</li>
            <li> If your hair is already curly or wavy this product is great for adding some more structure or calming frizz, but it doesnt work well on straight hair. They take a really long time to heat up and they don&#x27;t even get very hot. If you do end up using this product i recommend using a lot of hair spray or mousse.</li>
            <li> Conair is a great product, and having a choice of sizes, is a bonus!  1/2, 3/4, and 1 inch, all for one low price.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  They arrived on time and as described.  Will be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product very cheap quality. Doesn&#x27;t have heating control buttons nor on/off. Heats very poorly</li>
            <li> The barrels are shorter than I may have wanted them but getting 3 for a cheap price made it worth buying. Why not buy it?</li>
            <li> Just like getting three for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Got this for my niece for Christmas , and she loves using it every day .. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brither who he work evrything about the hair he gonna love  this, and the prize you cant complain about it</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with them.</li>
            <li> I would not even give this one star! My daughter uses this and it doesn&#x27;t even work! None of them do! It is a waste of money! There&#x27;s a reason why the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK. HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY AND ALL WERE THE SAME. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK ANY MORE SORRY TO LET YOU ALL KNOW BUT THERE CRAP BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!</li>
            <li> Still using after all this time.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Great price and works great. I love the different sizes. They heat up quickly. Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> My cosmetology teacher bought these for our class, and they don&#x27;t even get hot enough to use. I tried using them on my hair and it barely curled, even after waiting forever for it to heat up. No one uses these anymore; they&#x27;re inefficient.</li>
            <li> Your standard curlers at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair for years and mine stopped working so I thought this would be the same quality, but it isn&#x27;t.  While it may give you 3 sizes of irons, they are poor quality and now I have to find another one.  It&#x27;s my fault for thinking it would be same quality..</li>
            <li> Works wonders. heats up in a good amount of time. doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn your hair. But it does give amazing curls. I don&#x27;t think this is for everyday usage because of the pricing amount but for quick hair curls every so often I would expect this to last. I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks and I curl my hair more now because its easier to achieve.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was buying one curling iron, but when I received the package I was shocked in a good way. This purchase was totally awesome. I had three sizes for all types of hairstyles and hair lengths. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Such a good value.  Shared. One. With. My daugther</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough to really set it in</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my wife and she really likes them. They appear to be durable and are at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t do anything! it takes forever to heat up forever to hold your hair and does not girlcurls at all</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  Takes forever to heat up and still not hot enough to curl straight fine hair.  Typically have always used Conair and been very happy with the little bit more expensive models - the $9-12 range per iron which in my mind a great price. I should have just bought the same model I knew worked great.  These will all be going to Good Will and maybe work for someone without totally straight hair. Waste of my  money on these would not recommend buying this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use all three of them. I use the big curl one for the back of my hair, the middle one goes for the sides, and then the small one goes for the front. I love this set all you do is plug it in that&#x27;s it. There are NO settings and does not damage your hair.</li>
            <li> These are the worst curling irons. Do not buy them. they are a absolute waste of money. Do not trust the company! do not true the seller at all. Poor customer service. I called them and they didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING to help me. worst experience. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> These are awful. The hardly heat up at all. I got what I paid for with these. Spend a little more to get a worthy product.</li>
            <li> I received it on time even early as I recall.  I guess it was the same item as was listed.  I was hoping for a higher quality product but I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> I got these three in a pack and only use the smallest one because I have very fine hair. I only paid $20 for the three and am happy with them.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking the fattest one is a large size, think again. They are all slim curlers. My wife is not satisfued, but I say thats her problem. They were purchased for our daughters months ago and my wife hasnt even opened the package.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these curling irons but when i got them i was really dissapointed about the quality.when i got them i plugged them in and none of them heated up i tried to curl my hair but it didn&#x27;t even curl it at all. DON&#x27;T BUY THE PRODUCT!!! its horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> Gran daughter loved it</li>
            <li> These curling irons barely have any heat at all. They take forever to heat up, and once they do they don&#x27;t hold heat at all. Definitely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just the sizes I needed.  I had been looking for a while to find a good size and here they were.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, but they&#x27;re not the best. My favorite one is the middle size because it heats up the fastest and actually curls my hair</li>
            <li> My daughter loved them.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves them, uses them every day.  Much cheaper then the stores and it arrived fast and packaged great.</li>
            <li> these are horrible curling irons! They don&#x27;t even curl your hair! I bought these thinking they would be good since they were from Conair. They don&#x27;t even have an on button!</li>
            <li> Was truly disappointed as I paid for the item advertised; but received a different style which is of no use to me, made a complaint but never got an acknowledgement from the supplier.</li>
            <li> The curling irons I purchased don&#x27;t get hot enough. There&#x27;s only one setting for the heat on it do there&#x27;s no way to adjust to make hotter.</li>
            <li> These curling irons do not have an on/off switch though based on the photo it appears they do. If these had been more expensive, I would have returned them based on the fact that the photo is not a good representation. However, the price is very low and the 1/2-inch iron I used today worked just fine. I just need to be super careful about unplugging the device when done.</li>
            <li> Nice set for nearly all size curls</li>
            <li> Fills my need for the small curling iron</li>
            <li> I got this at like  Cvs and I have thick long hair I use so much sculpting gel , mousse and hair spray after spending 3 hours doing my hair and only made it through like 2 hours of dinner the rest of the night my hair was normal and straight as always I thought my hair was just impossible but it wasn&#x27;t me it was the product!</li>
            <li> my curling irons arrived quicky an in good working condition&lt;br /&gt;i wish they had on off switch but i always remember to upplu oro click off my surge protector</li>
            <li> Tri pack curling irons: No  on/off Switch. Not sure if it turns off after sometime, I wouldn&#x27;t chance it. Seems like it could be a fire hazard if you forget to turn off. Cheaply made with a flimsey plastic stand.Recommend purchasing a single well made curling iron.</li>
            <li> No heat control and barrel is way to short.  did not get very hot at all.</li>
            <li> 1 of the 3 never worked. And on using the other 2, I have noticed that it was a bad purchase</li>
            <li> Now i know why they give you three instead of one? Because only one of the three works at all.</li>
            <li> No fancy settings.  You plug it in and it comes on.  Very reasonable price for 3 curling irons and they certainly serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> I needed an inexpensive set just like this for curling synthetic wigs. The barrels don&#x27;t get terribly hot, which I wanted. They have no on/off switch, but DO have an auto-shutoff safety feature. They&#x27;re cute, arrived fast, do what I need them to do, and the price is Amazing!!! Is a great starter kit as well for younger teens/tweens  just learning how to use them.</li>
            <li> The irons dont get hot enough to curl and there is no auto shut off.</li>
            <li> Terrible purchase. Curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The grip don&#x27;t hold the hair correctly; does not have heat settings.  Will keep as a spare set.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and brilliant technology. It give off enough heat to keep your hair from heat abuse, that causes dryness and breakage. I use it for a slight bend to enhance volume.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected. Great product and I would highly recommend. Packaging was as it would be if purchased in a Brick and Mortar store - tamper proof, original Conair packaging.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but they do not get hot enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> great for the price and I am getting use to them.  can use for different sizes</li>
            <li> The different sizes are awesome.. bur they don&#x27;t seem to heat up quickly or stay hot.</li>
            <li> very cheap, barely gets hot.</li>
            <li> Super convenient that I got three for the price of one. It takes a bit to heat up (not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn&#x27;t an on/off switch; which I actually like since I can just plug it in, do something else (like change my clothes or whatever) then come back to work on my hair.  I have curly/wavy hair so holding a curl isn&#x27;t a problem at all. All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this product. Usually, curling irons that work for people with straight hair never seem to work for my hair. So maybe this iron is the opposite of the usual. Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.</li>
            <li> Curling irons take SOO long to get hot, and even then they aren&#x27;t that hot. Sucky product. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I should have never bought these it takes forever to heat up and when it finally does it does the worst curl on my hair.</li>
            <li> it takes too long to heat</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get that hot, the sizes are great but not the highest quality curling irons.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like and the cord is very short.</li>
            <li> Can not turn on and off , other than that great for the price</li>
    </ol>
