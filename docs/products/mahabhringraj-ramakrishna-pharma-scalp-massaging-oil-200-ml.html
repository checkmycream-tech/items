    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for me at all. Am returning it after realizing how oily, sticky and rough it makes the hair. While home-made amla oil gives you a nice deep sleep, this oil can cause strange dreams and unrestful sleep! The oil didn&#x27;t go away easily with shampooing! It took me two days to get the oil out. If you can stick to this oil, nothing like it, because it does have great ingredient list!</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff really puts me in a deep sleep. I awake feeling very well rested.</li>
            <li> need to use it for a month or so to see the results</li>
            <li> Love it. Not too greasy, smell good. Make my hair perfect shine.</li>
            <li> This product works. I have new growth. My hair has stopped shedding.  I also sleep better when I apply the oil, brush my hair for a couple of minutes then massage my scalp for 5-10 minutes. My brother used it and it&#x27;s starting to re-grow hair where it was very thin. I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a YouTuber. Read the ingredients on the bottle, then research each oil. Yeah . . . Works for me❤️</li>
            <li> yes and no.  I mean, I do like the oil.  I like how my hair looks and feels as far as shine and texture.  very shiny.  and slick n smooth but you can&#x27;t use too too much.  also if you are natural like I am you will have to clarify and clarify more often.  also I mixed alittle castor oil in mine. idk if this added beneficial to the mix of already ingredients or not.  lastly.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me or the product, but I know it&#x27;s supposed to cure headaches but seems like everytime I use it sooner or later in the day I end up getting one.  maybe I use too much ? which I don&#x27;t believe is the case or maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t do it right before bed time idk.  but yeah I&#x27;ll order again.  overall I like it.  it&#x27;s like nessasary food for my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging and super fast shipping and product as described. Will use again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a big change in my hair, I no longer use this oil, grape-seed oil is just as good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am using this to help regrow hair for my male pattern baldness. I have not yet seen any regrowth after 1 month, but the ingredients in this are very good for your hair. I put it on at night, and wash it in the morning. I will keep using it for 2-3 more months and post an update.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome just wish you sold it in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much but my hairloss is slowing decreasing. Maybe in a few months from now all see more prominent results</li>
            <li> The product did arrive at my residence this time and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, however I like the way my hair looks after putting it on my scalp.  I think I&#x27;ll have to use it for a while to see if my hair stops breaking and graying.  Anyway until next time.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 30 days, I notice some breakage in the top of my natural hair from something different I use, thought this product would help. it didn&#x27;t hurt and it didn&#x27;t help. I will continue to mix it with other hair oils to use it up</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Helps African American hair feel soft, silkier, and takes the frizzies. A little drop will do ya. Btw, try finding it at a local Indian grocery story because Amazon&#x27;s markup is rediculous. Bought a bottle for $3.49 at a nearby grocery.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and very excited to use it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve almost finished the bottle and there were no significant changes in my hair,no softer, no growth,nothing. it smells like an herbal oil not too pungent, will not be purchasing it again, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Help taken out of my feet.. Also helps me go to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Great as a body massage oil or hair moisturizing scalp massage oil. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor which is very nice. Good product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, to use for  Damage hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the original formula better but am using this...seems way too oily as compared with the original formula.</li>
            <li> My BFF suggested so I bought and it actually works for me. Not a great smell, but sometimes things that stink, works the best.....sometimes that is.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Started using the product and will verify results at a later date.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about 2 weeks now.  Too early to claim any results. Smells like chicken soup but it surely moisturizers your hair.  Will continue using it and hope to see results by my 3rd month.  Will keep everyone posted!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil.  It reminds me of the oil my grandmother used all the time in her hair. My husband loves the smell too!  I can&#x27;t comment on the benefits yet, but if it gives me memories of a loved one no longer around, then I&#x27;m sold !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, product received as expected and delivery was great!!!!! This item is a very effective item, I really like that it helps in my hair in so many ways, I would recomend this item to anyone working to improve their hair care.</li>
            <li> It solved dandruff problems in my family almost overnight (two days).  I believe my hair is growing faster lately and the scalp seems healthier. My family and I are using for about three months (not every day) and we are happy about results.  Please, keep in mind that this oil is NOT a dye for the hair, the gray hair will remain gray; however, it seems that less gray hair is showing.  Ayurvedic medicine has good formulas and I would recommend everybody to buy a reference book and understand better the relationship between gray hair and scalp, and possible solutions.</li>
