    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Is an excellent product , I recommended  100%</li>
            <li>Densifique smells great, each vial contains 6mL x 30.</li>
            <li>Works great, I and my friends have seen a difference.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but does nothing and shame on Loreal for marketing it as the &amp;#34;holy grail for thinning hair, bald.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>In one month I am already feeling a great difference..</li>
            <li>I have seen good results to date and would recommned this product for anyone in my situation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Good for hair density....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen pretty excellent results.</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>It is best to  use/apply before any real balding happends</li>
            <li>Gives a nice volume when applying it, nice packaging, and nice scent.  </li>
            <li>They sleep for a reason and then wake up again on their own.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing in this product or their research that says the hairs they are waking up our hair is that wouldn&#x27;t have woken up on their own.</li>
            <li>I’d have to say the Kerastase range was the most effective in hair regrowth and some thickening.</li>
            <li>and I find it more effective that minoxidil.  </li>
            <li>So this is a huge relief!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more tnan a year</li>
            <li>and I am seeing better results now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find any information on using it longer.</li>
            <li>When I saw family over Thanksgiving--who I hadn&#x27;t seen in three months--everyone commented that it looked like I had more hair.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll give it a couple more months just to see what happens.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll give it a couple more months just to see what happens.</li>
            <li>I love it , reallyreallyreally love</li>
            <li>I love it , reallyreallyreally love</li>
            <li>I love the way the product makes my hair feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 months and it does thicken my hair up a BIT.</li>
            <li>After doing a bit more research I found....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, been using it for around 7 months, it helps with hair density and stops shedding.</li>
            <li>Like this product I am using it for over a month and filling better about my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a thyroid condition which is responsible for my thinning hair, so I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work,  but it did!!</li>
            <li>(To be honest minoxidil significantly outperforms this product, its just butchers the skin in exchange).</li>
            <li>In the grand scheme of my hair loss journey, this product has been just one more marginally effective treatment that may have slowed my hair loss or temporarily improved things but didn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss.</li>
            <li>In the grand scheme of my hair loss journey, this product has been just one more marginally effective treatment that may have slowed my hair loss or temporarily improved things but didn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss.</li>
            <li>I kind of works as a product in itself really giving volume and thickening my hair.</li>
            <li>…sound familiar?</li>
            <li>Even my hair stylest noticed that my hair is better and there isn&#x27;t that much of hair falling.</li>
            <li>when use nonstop for three months....and feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I would have never heard or thought of using this product until my hair dresser recommended it to me after noticing some mild thining in my hair.</li>
            <li>As you can see above, I was making excellent progress after a couple of months--lots of vellus hairs growing in and overall my hair looked thicker and my scalp healthier than it had in years.</li>
            <li>I have a better diet now with more proteins in the morning and started taking Biotin supplements at the same time as well</li>
            <li>The hair loss reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>Do the treatment right, and wash every day to keep the scalp clean</li>
            <li>I have pretty advanced balding, so there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question I have lots of new hairs, most of which are colorless but seem to be growing longer.  </li>
            <li>It is a 3 months course, I have completed the first month and have noticed baby hair!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased, but results are inconclusive.</li>
            <li>but development continues on its own without further use.</li>
            <li>So far I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>It seems like a lot of work, but hey if you want results you need to work at it right?</li>
            <li>I start the sencond round, and will do a third month which is recommended for best results.</li>
            <li>so I bought the first pack with 30 vials and tomorrow</li>
            <li>I first used the Kerastase treatment for thinning hair for about a year.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m more bald now than I was 1.5 years ago, during which time I&#x27;ve been taking Propecia and using Densifique on a regular (although not every day) basis.</li>

            <li>The key here is to more apply in attention (thinning or bald) areas.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that is giving me results!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I paid a lot of money (3 months bottles) for a product that eventually did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>I am seeing positive results using it for close to 2 months.</li>
            <li>and I nearly have a full beard.</li>
            <li>Let that dry then apply more product.</li>
            <li>but i really believe it is the Kerastase Densifique product which helped.</li>
            <li>My hair is also in much healthier condition.  </li>
            <li>I really needed it.</li>
            <li>very goood ,very gnice&lt;br</li>
            <li>goood ,very gnice&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what the hold up really is.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two years, have gone from very short hair to long hair, plus thicker hair, and I&#x27;m an older person, so hair growth is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used the first 30 day package some new hairs are growing.</li>
            <li>Her hair does look healthier and per other reviews, it takes about three months for most users to see any results.</li>
            <li>I put it on for the first time today and it smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can live with that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen excellent limited results, although I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to fully grow back my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neogenic for around 5 months and it does work decently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels thicker all the way around, and overall my hair looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>and i noticed lots of new hair growing.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hairloss have reduced and the new hair growth is stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle product by any means and definitely not worth the huge price tag.</li>
            <li>after first 30 bottles, there is absolutely no visual change at all.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether this will work for sure, but I have ordered the item and have been using it for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Put it on for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Now I am using Densifique and see a marked difference after one month.</li>
            <li>which is the only place I can really examine).</li>
            <li>I didnt see a real difference till the beginning of the third month.</li>
            <li>but so far it has made a difference to the thickness and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>, my brows and eyelashes are EPIC</li>
            <li>I continue to use it because I think it makes my hair look somewhat fuller and healthier by giving me some vellus hair growth, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t grown back my hair or halted my male-pattern baldness--which is apparently unstoppable.p healthier than it had in years.</li>

            <li>The only problem with this particular version is that it is made for women.</li>
            <li>Will more vellus hairs grow in the spots that are currently bald, and will those velllus hairs eventually turn into full, thick, dark hairs?</li>
            <li>I have had thinning hair since my mid twenties, so nearly a decade now!!</li>
            <li>Usually I would dread a hair cut, as id have to come in without toppik on and have my thinning hair in the spot light of a hairdressers attention.  </li>
            <li>what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on l&#x27;oreal, it is a pity that such company would go for such cheap tactics to rob distressed ppl coz of hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the key is just to get new growth going.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say that it worth that amount of money, IMO it is a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li>So maybe it will reinvigorate recently lost hairs but not dead hair follicles.</li>
            <li>I would have given it five stars but feel it&#x27;s a bit too early in the treatment to properly evaluate it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li>A real waste of money, I have used this product for full 6 months with no difference</li>
            <li>Lots of new hairs growing in the front and center area of the head.</li>
            <li>Although a completely unique mechanism, it&#x27;s the closest you’ll get to minoxdil in terms of hair “regrowth” without tight skin, dark puffy eyes pimples and ozzing skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would have never heard or thought of using this product until my hair dresser recommended it to me after noticing some mild thining in my hair. It is best to  use/apply before any real balding happends so I bought the first pack with 30 vials and tomorrow I start the sencond round, and will do a third month which is recommended for best results. I wash my hair every morning with the Densifique shampoo, towel dry my hair, apply the vial, and then massage the scalp. I don&#x27;t put anything else in my hair, no product and let it work all day long. I kind of works as a product in itself really giving volume and thickening my hair. I have seen good results to date and would recommned this product for anyone in my situation. Do the treatment right, and wash every day to keep the scalp clean so the product can be well aborbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month so far.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work- I can see some small new hair at the hair line.</li>
            <li> I am using it only two weeks and my hair is no falling like before . Is an excellent product , I recommended  100%</li>
            <li> I would say that the jury is still out on this product. It seems like a lot of work, but hey if you want results you need to work at it right?</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more tnan a year and I have not seen any results yet</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and half and I am seeing better results now. Lots of new hairs growing in the front and center area of the head. I have used minoxidil based product in the past and it did not help. I will post an update after few months.</li>
            <li> I first used the Kerastase treatment for thinning hair for about a year. Now I am using Densifique and see a marked difference after one month. Even my shampoo person at the salon commented on hair growth in areas that had not grow hair since I removed my extensions several years ago.</li>
            <li> This was purchased on behalf of my friend. She&#x27;s been using it for about a month. Her hair does look healthier and per other reviews, it takes about three months for most users to see any results. I wasn&#x27;t able to find any information on using it longer. I&#x27;ll update this if she decided to reorder.</li>
            <li> Nov. 14. I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month now. I&#x27;ve seen excellent limited results, although I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to fully grow back my hair. I have pretty advanced balding, so there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels thicker all the way around, and overall my hair looks better than it has in a long time. I can see numerous vellus hairs growing in front (which is the only place I can really examine). I also notice tons of smaller, micro-hairs that seem to be sprouting, although whether they are actually going to come in is unclear (and perhaps they&#x27;ve always been there?). Will more vellus hairs grow in the spots that are currently bald, and will those velllus hairs eventually turn into full, thick, dark hairs? Also, does the product continue to work AFTER three months? So far I&#x27;m pleased, but results are inconclusive. I will post an update in another month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Dec. 4: Have been using the product for about 7 weeks. I&#x27;ve seen pretty excellent results. When I saw family over Thanksgiving--who I hadn&#x27;t seen in three months--everyone commented that it looked like I had more hair. It could partly be that my hair is longer now than I typically wear it, which makes it look thicker (especially on the sides), but I think it&#x27;s definitely also the Densifique. There&#x27;s no question I have lots of new hairs, most of which are colorless but seem to be growing longer.  On the other hand, on patches of my scalp where I&#x27;m completely bald, I haven&#x27;t seen anything sprouting yet. So maybe it will reinvigorate recently lost hairs but not dead hair follicles. Feeling optimistic, but we&#x27;ll see in another month where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 21. Have used the product for over three months (about 13 weeks), and honestly, after a hopeful start, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the results. As you can see above, I was making excellent progress after a couple of months--lots of vellus hairs growing in and overall my hair looked thicker and my scalp healthier than it had in years. Unfortunately the progress did not continue. Over the last 5 or 6 weeks it didn&#x27;t get noticeably thicker at all, and in fact, I think I went backwards and lost quite a few hairs. Overall, I&#x27;m a little bit ahead of where I started but the improvement has been minimal. The questions I have now are: Is the product only supposed to work for three months? (and is that why the clinical trial was only for three months and not longer?). If you stop using the product will you lose any gains you made (as you do with Rogaine)? Does the product actually re-activate dormant hair follicles or is it just shortening the resting phase of the hair cycle, or what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I should keep using the product or not, but I think I&#x27;ll give it a couple more months just to see what happens. Overall, though, a disappointing result after a promising start. As a result, I&#x27;ve downgraded the rating from 4 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: April, 2015. In the grand scheme of my hair loss journey, this product has been just one more marginally effective treatment that may have slowed my hair loss or temporarily improved things but didn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss. I think I&#x27;m more bald now than I was 1.5 years ago, during which time I&#x27;ve been taking Propecia and using Densifique on a regular (although not every day) basis. I continue to use it because I think it makes my hair look somewhat fuller and healthier by giving me some vellus hair growth, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t grown back my hair or halted my male-pattern baldness--which is apparently unstoppable.p healthier than it had in years.

            <li> That&#x27;s maybe a premature review but ive been using the product for two weeks now and i noticed lots of new hair growing. I have a better diet now with more proteins in the morning and started taking Biotin supplements at the same time as well but i really believe it is the Kerastase Densifique product which helped. I lost loads of hair over last few years due to stress and extensions but they seem to start regrowing. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> After the third week hair loss has stopped by 90%. This product is a must buy. Even my hair stylest noticed that my hair is better and there isn&#x27;t that much of hair falling.</li>
            <li> I just completed this program, 90 days.  I am amazed at results.  I didnt see a real difference till the beginning of the third month. I have had thinning hair since my mid twenties, so nearly a decade now!! I have a thyroid condition which is responsible for my thinning hair, so I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work,  but it did!! At first all I noticed was an increase in little baby hairs around the hair line/temple/forehead,  and this was slightly annoying to be ( it my hair part that shows the visible signs of thinning,  and thats the area I wanted filled in!!) I gathered that maybe the program wasn&#x27;t going to work for me, but I continued none the less! During the end part of the second month however,  I noticed I was using less and less toppik (a hair loss concealer that blends with your hair. I usually use it on the hair just before my centre part, so it binds there and makes my part less wide).on completing the program im not using toppik at all! My hair part now looks relatively normal,  not abundant,  but it no longer screams thinning hair, if u know wat I mean,  and I can live with that! My hair is also in much healthier condition.  Im so relieved I found a product that works for me. Expensive, yes, but at least I know I haven&#x27;t wasted my money.  Ill do the 90 days treatment again in time when I have the cash to spare. I have a hair cut appointment today and im looking forward to it. Usually I would dread a hair cut, as id have to come in without toppik on and have my thinning hair in the spot light of a hairdressers attention.  So this is a huge relief!</li>
            <li> Stemoxydine no matter the brand works if you’re patient enough to regrow you’re hair.  Although a completely unique mechanism, it&#x27;s the closest you’ll get to minoxdil in terms of hair “regrowth” without tight skin, dark puffy eyes pimples and ozzing skin…sound familiar? Anyways, I’m not talking just maintaining hair growth but actually REGROWING hairs in vacant zones.  Biggest downfall is the product takes too long to see visible results. Not sure about 1,700 new hairs in 3 months but development continues on its own without further use. Everything else out there is just a scam (L-arginine, Har Vokse, Copper Peptides, Nanoxidil, Growth Factors, even Phytolium 4) I’ll try to make this review as informative as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying Densifique, Neogenic (currently on Redken Cerafill) I’d have to say the Kerastase range was the most effective in hair regrowth and some thickening. (To be honest minoxidil significantly outperforms this product, its just butchers the skin in exchange). Densifique smells great, each vial contains 6mL x 30. I made my routine 2mL per mornings and night lasting me waaaay over a month. The key here is to more apply in attention (thinning or bald) areas. Let that dry then apply more product. Don’t just exhaust it everywhere to get it over with! I take the time to get the product in the areas I really needed it. I used on the beard and I nearly have a full beard. The hairs are so slow in transitioning to terminal no matter how much of the product is applied. However the key is just to get new growth going. Two months into my journey I see the tinniest hairs getting the strength to grow! 4 months later the baby hairs continued to get thicker and thicker even without the product. Would I recommend this product? Yes, but don’t expect any overnight miracles. I was frustrated with the lengthy time it took but it works!</li>
            <li> Works great, I and my friends have seen a difference. Only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive and have noticed my hair shed really bad when you discontinue use for a week.</li>
            <li> after first 30 bottles, there is absolutely no visual change at all.</li>
            <li> very goood ,very gnice&lt;br /&gt; I love it , reallyreallyreally love so much!&lt;br /&gt;I will wont to buy again ~!&lt;br /&gt;very goood ,very gnice&lt;br /&gt; I love it , reallyreallyreally love so much!&lt;br /&gt;I will wont to buy again ~!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product a short time but so far it has made a difference to the thickness and texture of my hair. I would have given it five stars but feel it&#x27;s a bit too early in the treatment to properly evaluate it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neogenic for around 5 months and it does work decently. The only problem with this particular version is that it is made for women. I put it on for the first time today and it smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This low rating is not a reflection on its effectiveness, but rather in that it should say &#x27;for women&#x27; or whatever. It&#x27;s so expensive that I will continue to smell like my grandmother until its gone. However, I will then go back to Neogenic. The downfall for Neogenic is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in the US. Don&#x27;t know what the hold up really is.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this will work for sure, but I have ordered the item and have been using it for 2 weeks now. I am posting the pictures on my  blog here..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving  5 star for this only because i am seeing the thin hair strands getting a little firm after using it for 2 weeks and i seem some change. I do not understand how few reviewers say that it does not work, when the product just got into the market few months ago and the the test period suggested by the company is 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 9/10 - I have started seeing a lot of tiny hairs showing up after One and half months of use. Will they grow longer and thicker is the question I have now..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 9/21 - I should say.. I am seeing positive results using it for close to 2 months. This is the first product that is giving me results!!&lt;br /&gt;The 30 vials is lasting 2 months for me - may vary for others. Today I have ordered for the second one.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few days and made the texture of my hair too soft and mushy.  This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a 3 months course, I have completed the first month and have noticed baby hair! Will update my review after completing the 3 months</li>
            <li> I love the way the product makes my hair feel and smell.  It also is similar to the other product the Loreal sells of the same type of formula for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth It!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 months and it does thicken my hair up a BIT. Not a miracle product by any means and definitely not worth the huge price tag.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot of money (3 months bottles) for a product that eventually did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> I used the first 30 day package some new hairs are growing. My hairdresser says I have to use it at least for 3 months to see the change. this is my 2nd month. Hope it works and stays.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice volume when applying it, nice packaging, and nice scent.  Havent seen dramatic changes though</li>
            <li> kullanmaya henuz basladigim icin etkisini henuz goremedim. kullanimi tamamlayinca tekrar yazacagim.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on this product.  Smells great, but does nothing and shame on Loreal for marketing it as the &amp;#34;holy grail for thinning hair, bald.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a good thing FDA warned them against using such claims and using stem cells to market it.</li>
            <li> Put it on for the first time last night. I smell like a Vogue magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re male, I hear there&#x27;s a man&#x27;s version that&#x27;s not designed for sale in the US. I&#x27;d suggest trying it instead. This version, seriously, Vogue.... yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. After doing a bit more research I found.... this stuff just wakes up sleeping hairs. They sleep for a reason and then wake up again on their own. there&#x27;s nothing in this product or their research that says the hairs they are waking up our hair is that wouldn&#x27;t have woken up on their own. It could be this product is giving you a short-term benefit and long-term burnout. I decided to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition.  I have used this product before and I find it more effective that minoxidil.  A little pricey, though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using it for around 7 months, it helps with hair density and stops shedding.</li>
            <li> In one month I am already feeling a great difference.. The hair loss reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I love this product! Good for hair density....when use nonstop for three months....and feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for about 1 month now. I noticed my hairloss have reduced and the new hair growth is stronger and thicker. So far I am enjoying this product. Looking forward to finishing the 3 months of treatment.</li>
            <li> A real waste of money, I have used this product for full 6 months with no difference what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on l&#x27;oreal, it is a pity that such company would go for such cheap tactics to rob distressed ppl coz of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I genuinely doubt the ratings and other reviews for this product, now I am starting to believe that they hire ppl to give fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A RIP OFF</li>
            <li> This product works well in combination with Minoxidil and Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice increase in density, also, my brows and eyelashes are EPIC (i was specifically applying it to them). It also makes my beard a little bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Tho, I can&#x27;t say that it worth that amount of money, IMO it is a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> Like this product I am using it for over a month and filling better about my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years, have gone from very short hair to long hair, plus thicker hair, and I&#x27;m an older person, so hair growth is pretty amazing.  It works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Kerastase Densifique for several months now and I definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless product, did not make any difference...</li>
