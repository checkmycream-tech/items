            <li>I thought it would be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for daily body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If I could get it out of the bottle I would LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil....</li>
            <li>Love it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Would be better in a jar instead of  bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product to protect my hair from static electricity and damage through the winter months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to a friend! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>perfect for my acne prone skin and  will last for a lonng time !</li>
            <li>I am sooo pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the consistency.  </li>
            <li>The coconut oil is a much better quality than others I&#x27;ve used on skin.</li>
            <li>I try to find the most refined better stuff..</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair and skin soft and smelling good!</li>
            <li>very good products I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li>other oils didn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes phenomenally!</li>
            <li>Overall really great.</li>
            <li>It really would be nice if it were in a glass container and a bit more accessible, but it&#x27;s worth it for now.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a small amount of this on my acne and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it though to use on my face</li>
            <li>make sure the cap is closed good.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more, amazing</li>
            <li>Awesome after taking a nice hot shower, relaxes your muscles, great for massages, also for dry skin, and the aroma is real coconut, must use very little, since is very oily.</li>
            <li>Too skinny to get out when cooled so other than that it was great.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Does not leave an oily residue, soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Though it seems coconut oil absorbs abnormally quickly.</li>
            <li>I have 40 inches of virgin hair that I&#x27;ve been growing for 12 years and this product helps me keep my long hair detangled and in good condition.</li>
            <li>This product definitely my new FAVORITE ingredient in home-made bath and body products.  </li>
            <li>Having to melt it in hot water for each use is a pain!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into skin easily and makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use it from the bottle.just put it flat on top of the stove.the heat</li>
            <li>when I opened it I noticed how fresh the smell</li>
            <li>more then what i expected :)</li>
            <li>The bottle is a plastic jail for it though, good luck figuring that one out.</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to squeeze out of the bottle and melts instantly with the warmth of your hands for easy application head to toe.</li>
            <li>Very pure.</li>
            <li>Lovely natural scent, very natural and clean feeling on skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent oil, but you can plainly see the bottle, and yes it is solid at room temperature, so keep that in mind before you purchase.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It even works pretty well on spots where I see something forming.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>you will need to put the bottle in some hot water to make it liquified.</li>
            <li>(I melted mine with hot water and then poured it into a mason jar)</li>
            <li>Use it quickly if you live in a very humid environment.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this and would recommend it for anyone bothered by dry skin.</li>
            <li>Works really well in my hair</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making a product so beneficial and</li>
            <li>I really like this coconut</li>
            <li>oil.it smells really</li>
            <li>10 seconds later it&#x27;s like a light moisturizer and</li>
            <li>and I use it for oil pulling, tastes better than other oils.</li>
            <li>taste is rich but not overwhelming, and my skin has demonstrated a change for the better within the last month.</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily on face and body--especially right after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, however once it gel back up its hard to ge out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Use it on skin or scalp, makes my skin very soft and gives shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more bought some over the counter absolutely no comparison!</li>
            <li>I just run the bottle under hot tap water for several seconds to allow a little to melt, then it dispenses easily.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product,  I had bought a different brand that was supposed to be organic, 100% pure</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh and it does NOT smell like fake coconut.</li>
            <li>It is quite thick in the bottle but, melts down to a very fine oil.</li>
            <li>Good product but very difficult to extract.</li>

            <li> It is quite thick in the bottle but, melts down to a very fine oil.</li>
            <li> Good product but very difficult to extract.</li>
            <li> I have used your product cooking, bath oil, deep conditioner for my hair and even for the dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it in various ways, I use it to make soap or apply small amounts directly to my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s minor.</li>
            <li> You can barely stick your finger down in it to get some out.  </li>
            <li> Saved my skin from this dry winter season.</li>
            <li> However, I use it on dry patches of skin and stretch marks</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin though and have to be careful about over applying as it will dry out my face.</li>
            <li> The product, coconut oil is partially coagulated.</li>
            <li> but I actually prefer this bottle to the messy jars.</li>
            <li> (A little bit goes a long way).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with it!</li>
            <li> Your product however, WAS pure organic and a big difference in the other product was that your product is cold pressed and Unrefined (where the other was not).</li>
            <li> got hard or solid.</li>
            <li> Comes out of the bottle thick, instantly begins to melt and turn to oil.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, not easy to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Not good for use with essential oils just in case</li>
            <li> use it to cook and even to put a little in my hair or hands.</li>
            <li> Not as messy as the ones that come in a jar that sometimes leak.</li>
            <li> and I have never been so broken out, not since middle school.</li>
            <li> will melt the hard oil and it will turn in to liquid.but</li>
            <li> I use it for everything from cooking to my hair, skin and even to condition leather and some hard wood surfaces..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold pressed which means it&#x27;s solid</li>
            <li> Bottle sucks but</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard plastic with a very small opening.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY thick in the bottle, so it is a bit hard to get out</li>
            <li> How dumb is that?  </li>
            <li> but I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> no oily residue behind it absorbs as its suppose to .</li>
            <li> This oil will be hard if it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> Also, with any cold pressed organic oils, it will mold.</li>
            <li> Seriously so bad.</li>
            <li> It is cold pressed and it&amp;#34;s not refined.....perfect!</li>

            <li> Good product but very difficult to extract.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works so good in my hair and on my face</li>
            <li> Awesome after taking a nice hot shower, relaxes your muscles, great for massages, also for dry skin, and the aroma is real coconut, must use very little, since is very oily. Definitely a great buy is you are looking for Coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my hair</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It keeps my skin very moisturized. I just love the way it smells ..👍👍</li>
            <li> Use for everything great product</li>
            <li> I have been using a small amount of this on my acne and I am very impressed. It even works pretty well on spots where I see something forming. I do have dry skin though and have to be careful about over applying as it will dry out my face. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it change colors. got hard or solid. must be my fault! I gave it away</li>
            <li> Too skinny to get out when cooled so other than that it was great.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I used this on my legs one time..... what a difference!! Saved my skin from this dry winter season.</li>
            <li> when I got the bottle I noticed it was hand made. when I opened it I noticed how fresh the smell is.&lt;br /&gt;it seems as though this hand made product was made it a loving grandmothers backyard delivered to your door.&lt;br /&gt;my food tastes great as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair and skin soft and smelling good!</li>
            <li> Best all natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin and I use it for oil pulling, tastes better than other oils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil.  I use it on my skin and hair as well as making wonderful moisturizers and lip balms!  Ive tried many different brands and this one is the best ive found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not quite what I expected.  I thought it would be more moisturizing.  But in all it is and OK product, shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Great deal I got three the smell is awesome</li>
            <li> Great for skin! Does not leave an oily residue, soaks in quickly. Perfect for daily body moisturizer. G G G</li>
            <li> This is wonderful...I use it on my face and teeth!! Thanks for making a product so beneficial and pure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Hutchens&lt;br /&gt;President of SABORAM INC</li>
            <li> Just as expected, not easy to get out of the bottle but that&#x27;s minor. Great product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> very good products I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product definitely my new FAVORITE ingredient in home-made bath and body products.  It congeals, but it melts rapidly on contact with skin</li>
            <li> great oil....i cooked an egg with it and it was great....i also put in my hair and its so shiny, and my daughter used on skin......will buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold pressed which means it&#x27;s solid and it&#x27;s in a bottle that&#x27;s hard plastic with a very small opening.  You can barely stick your finger down in it to get some out.  How dumb is that?  If I could get it out of the bottle I would LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I also use this item on my hair to combat dryness and change up every now and then.</li>
            <li> Great for skin hair even cooking. Loving it !!!!</li>
            <li> How do you get it out of the bottle--it&#x27;s solid.Having to melt it in hot water for each use is a pain!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil....I keep it in the shower so when I am done with my shower I can slather it on. (A little bit goes a long way). My skin is loving it, it is soft and moisturized (I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I am prone to breakouts) and it is doing an amazing job at keeping my eczema in check!! My bff put some in a homemade sugar scrub she made and the results were AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling.  Not as messy as the ones that come in a jar that sometimes leak. Love it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> smells like coconuts! other oils didn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes phenomenally!</li>
            <li> I really like this coconut oil.it smells really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use it from the bottle.just put it flat on top of the stove.the heat will melt the hard oil and it will turn in to liquid.but make sure the cap is closed good.</li>
            <li> Bottle sucks but product is great</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just put the bottle in some warm water and in no time it is liquid and can be poured out of the bottle. It really would be nice if it were in a glass container and a bit more accessible, but it&#x27;s worth it for now.  And if you are needing a lot, just cut the top off and it slides out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. One of the best I have ever used.The smell is amazing and the quality of the oil is great. It is quite thick in the bottle but, melts down to a very fine oil. A little goes a long way with it! I use iT for scalp massage. Definitely reccommend! Fast shipping as well! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, however once it gel back up its hard to ge out of the bottle</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this four start and not five is because it is a pain to get out of the container. Would be better in a jar instead of  bottle. Other than that this is a great product. Used it for a body scrub.</li>
            <li> Lovely natural scent, very natural and clean feeling on skin and hair.  Easy to squeeze out of the bottle and melts instantly with the warmth of your hands for easy application head to toe. I&#x27;m using this product to protect my hair from static electricity and damage through the winter months. I have 40 inches of virgin hair that I&#x27;ve been growing for 12 years and this product helps me keep my long hair detangled and in good condition. I&#x27;d recommend this product to a friend! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more, amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cook and even to put a little in my hair or hands. Not kidding.</li>
            <li> perfect for my acne prone skin and  will last for a lonng time ! more then what i expected :)</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product,  I had bought a different brand that was supposed to be organic, 100% pure but I was not happy with it. Your product however, WAS pure organic and a big difference in the other product was that your product is cold pressed and Unrefined (where the other was not). I have used your product cooking, bath oil, deep conditioner for my hair and even for the dry spots on my face. I am sooo pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor! thanks!</li>
            <li> I love it. Will be buying more. Bought it for my hair. Its doing a great job. Even using it on my braids.</li>
            <li> This oil will be hard if it&#x27;s cold. you will need to put the bottle in some hot water to make it liquified. Also, with any cold pressed organic oils, it will mold. Use it quickly if you live in a very humid environment.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. I use it for a skin moisturizer, hair conditioner and  oil pulling. It is cold pressed and it&amp;#34;s not refined.....perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the consistency.  I use it twice daily on face and body--especially right after getting out of the shower.  It absorbs into skin easily and makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle had an indentation as a likely result of air pressure changes. The product, coconut oil is partially coagulated. I set the bottle in my shower and after I showered, shook the bottle until it dissolved and mixed. The coconut oil is a much better quality than others I&#x27;ve used on skin.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product non greasy makes skin and hair look fabulous! Will definitely buy more bought some over the counter absolutely no comparison!</li>
            <li> Very nice product - smells great too!!</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of Coconut oil.. I try to find the most refined better stuff.. I use it for everything from cooking to my hair, skin and even to condition leather and some hard wood surfaces.. This is by far one of the best I have found and it smells amazing leaves no oily residue behind it absorbs as its suppose to . Great Stuff plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> Overall really great. I originally bought it though to use on my face but I have acne at age 21 and oily skin and I have never been so broken out, not since middle school. Seriously so bad. However, I use it on dry patches of skin and stretch marks and I like it a lot. Though it seems coconut oil absorbs abnormally quickly. You put it on and it&#x27;s like melted butter then 10 seconds later it&#x27;s like a light moisturizer and then 20 minutes later it&#x27;s as if I never put it on. Anyway, smells nice and I like it. The bottle is a plastic jail for it though, good luck figuring that one out. (I melted mine with hot water and then poured it into a mason jar)</li>
            <li> I use it in various ways, I use it to make soap or apply small amounts directly to my hair and skin. I also add it to melted bees wax for a mixture that once it cools is solid.Then I apply as needed to  help control my overly curly  hair.</li>
            <li> This is excellent oil, but you can plainly see the bottle, and yes it is solid at room temperature, so keep that in mind before you purchase. Not good for use with essential oils just in case that&#x27;s not obvious.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The scent is light and fresh and it does NOT smell like fake coconut. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle but I actually prefer this bottle to the messy jars. I just run the bottle under hot tap water for several seconds to allow a little to melt, then it dispenses easily.</li>
            <li> Very good, so glad I ordered it.  Have found cheaper place to buy it now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but this is an awesome product. Use it on skin or scalp, makes my skin very soft and gives shine to my hair. It is VERY thick in the bottle, so it is a bit hard to get out but so worth it. Comes out of the bottle thick, instantly begins to melt and turn to oil. Love it, Love it, Love it. I will be ordering more of this and would recommend it for anyone bothered by dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by this product , I&#x27;ve ordered it twice in bigger bottles , and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful on skin as well in consumption .The taste is rich but not overwhelming, and my skin has demonstrated a change for the better within the last month. Delivery and package was great . Simply great service over all. Very pleased will order again. A little goes a long way. Very pure.</li>
