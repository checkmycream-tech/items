They are definitely worth it and I am very pleased with them. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> As soon as my order arrived, I opened it. My sister said she never had this product before and wants to try. She was blessed with decent skin, but having reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27; she was slightly disturbed by the little lines and bagging under my eyes. My sister finds this mask easy to use. She loves it and thinks it is a fabulous product. When she applied this mask, she looked silly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  LOL After half an hour, when she removed it, Voilà no more bags or tiny lines. All gone! I could see and feel the difference, immediately. Her skin felt silky and soft. This product worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Product was received complimentary for review purposes. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this mask was that it was Korean made, which made me super excited. Korea is known for being innovators in the beauty community. I&#x27;ve worn 2 of the masks and was pleased with the results both times. After each application my face felt soft, smooth, and seemed to glow. The instructions are easy to follow. Wear for a half hour, remove, rub excess into face or gently wipe off. I&#x27;m not sure how much the results last or if using them is more of a luxury thing, but I really enjoy these masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> I have used 2.  As it made my skin super soft and silky for the moments after; I have not noticed any lasting benefits or differences in my skin. The next day my skin didn&#x27;t seem changed.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, just love it.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow. My skin is clarified and smoother... When I use this product makes a remarkable difference on my clogged pores and overall texture. Highly recommended. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love that this product was made in Korea and was excited to try it out.I heard lots of good things about products made their specifically beauty products.I am always looking for ways to stay youthful so I was excited to get this in.It really does make my face feel much cleaner,tighter,&amp; radiant after applying I have already used up 2 of my masks from this 4 pack and it feels very nice on my skin when I use it.I can even do other things while I am waiting for the time to pass which is 30minutes is the time to leave this on.I really love that this mask comes in 2 pieces, one for the mouth and jaw area &amp; the other part for your nose and above.It really makes the application part easier and you can really line everything up correctly.It is very easy to apply just peel away from the plastic it is on and apply.You do not even have to wash it off.After you are done with the 30minutes you just rub in the gel left on the face which was not much into your skin and voila you are done.It does feel a little sticky but after awhile it dried up and felt much better.It has a cutout for your eye and mouth, the nose part just lays over your nose so it does not cover your nostril area.Very easy use which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> The part that is meant to go on your nose does not stick.The top part of the mask also slides, so it becomes a problem seeing anything. I don&#x27;t know if it really worked because I ended up taking it off and throwing it away. I will eventually give it another chance, when I run out of a clay mask I also got from Amazon. But it is not something I will waste more money on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey--but it is so worth the money. From the first day, I saw a difference in the softness of my skin. Perfect to take on vacation. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not worth a penny.  It was so messy and difficult to use.  In addition,  didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>

            <li> not what I  thought my friends love it</li>
            <li> So I tried out this  ULTIMATE COLLAGEN FACIAL APPLICATOR ,MASK FOR SKIN REJUVENATION. This one goes around the whole outer part of your eye. Let me say that these collagen eye mask work fantastic!! After 45 minutes of use. Your skin will look better. Its almost like having a mini facelift! i would use them a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen protein is present in the connective tissue of the human body. It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production of collagen is slowed around the age of 25. After that with each passing year the body produces less and less collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is not rapid but gradually the signs start showing on your face in the form of dullness, fine lines, age spots, bags and dark circles under eyes and later on sadly wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of collagen for skin are that you will slow down all the conditions mentioned above and hence reduce the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution For All Your Skin Care Problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are not using the collagen that is specifically designed to eliminate the dark circles and bags under your eyes. This will rejuvenate your skin making it radiant, youthful, and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum can offer a wide range of benefits. It is definitely effective in helping to produce healthier, younger looking skin. A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure. Hyaluronic serum is actually an excellent antioxidant, and when your serum is capable of reaching the deepest layers of your skin, it can be incredibly effective at reversing damage to your cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that makes your skin soft and fresh, and smooth. Fast delivery. I feel my face more tight and fresh, and skin is not as dry as before . Recommended</li>
