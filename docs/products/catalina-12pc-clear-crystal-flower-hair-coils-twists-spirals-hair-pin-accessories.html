            <li> These hair coils are very pretty. I wanted to give her extra bling under her veil for her wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;I received them very quickly and the seller contacted me within a week to see if I got them and if I was happy with the purchase.

            <li> These are so cute but they are tuff to get out your hair once in for hole day I put them in my hair when I do a bun for work and everyone loves them but I loss hair when it comes time to take them out because they get caught in my hair and pull some out but over all I keep using them to cute</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Great value. Two stones were loose and I had to glue them in.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Design and craftsmanship are good for this price.  Only drawback is that the end of the curling wire is not processed to avoid scratching.</li>
