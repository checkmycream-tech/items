            <li>I am very happy with the color, I have never been a redhead, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got Great coverage! &#x27;</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how great this product is</li>
            <li>I think it looks great, but I would have preferred a lighter result as pictured on the box.  </li>
            <li>This product has great conditioner and all</li>
            <li>THIS DEAL WAS GREAT ...</li>
            <li>It colors gray great.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it if you don&#x27;t want to be embarrassed by your own smell!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased at the results for under $10.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;!&#x27;</li>
            <li>I will never buy again, even if after my hair dries it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Does the job, is a nice color.</li>
            <li>Over all though it put some dimension of colors into it which was nice.</li>
            <li>I also liked the bee pollen treatment.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again, the results were nice</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want them to be permanent.e nice</li>
            <li>Thinking I may even start trying to cover it by adding lavendar oil or something else that smells strong but good.  </li>
            <li>it will really give you a beautiful color....</li>
            <li>A friend suggested that I try L&#x27;Oreal Healthy Color</li>
            <li>I decided to try 5R healthy look (</li>
            <li>I love how it did that.</li>
            <li>Maybe a more ask color with darken it just a tad better.</li>
            <li>I love Healthy Look Chestnut Brown.</li>
            <li>Healthy Look</li>
            <li>In order to fix it, I bought the chestnut color again and it turned out ok, a bit lighter at the roots</li>
            <li>So what it did was it bleached my hair to a rusty orange colour so that the chestnut color could go on top.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for many years and have gotten to be quite the pro at it.</li>
            <li>the color is very natural looking and my hair looks beautiful and healthy with the Feria product.</li>
            <li>Cat piss is a very unique scent, so you&#x27;ll have to wonder if the makers of the conditioner emulated it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been good but during the summer gets too light too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now onto the most important part: the color.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was great , made my hair shiney amd soft.</li>
            <li>5CB - Chestnut Brown was so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>No breakage on fine hair and easy .</li>
            <li>Instead I ended up with a head full of orange hair (that I had to cover with a better product) and the stinky-stink smell did not come out for days.</li>
            <li>I pray that this is truly temporary color and that I have my beautiful hair back in 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a light brown</li>
            <li>I used spiced praline (light reddish brown) and like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>just wish there were a shade lighter available.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair for years using L&#x27;oreal 6rb light reddish brown</li>
            <li>I wanted to lighten my hair to light brown.</li>
            <li>I could always count on good gray coverage and soft hair from this brand.</li>
            <li>... VERY DISSATISFIED!!!</li>
            <li>Been coloring for years, and trying Healthy Look was my first in the 10-minute, semi-permanent realm.  </li>
            <li>do a strand test, follow the timing directions, and have fun with it!</li>
            <li>Arrived super-fast and exactly as described :)</li>
            <li>so I decided to go with a lighter, cooler brown colour, like a light cool ash brown, and that&#x27;s when the disasters started.</li>
            <li>This color turned my gray roots bright orange and left my brown hair with a strage orange hue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed and won&#x27;t use Healthy Look again.</li>
            <li>No bad smell, no burning, no stinging.....</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Feria user, but I fell for the tv ad for this product.  </li>
            <li>It turned out a bit more redddish than I thought it would be, but not a bad result - it still looks natural and the grays just look like highlights.  </li>
            <li>They came promptly and were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell (compared to other hair colors).  </li>
            <li>and you cannot find a red to get a nice shade...</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had used this on her hair and it turned out to be a beautiful natural color - exactly the same color as the model on the box!  </li>
            <li>, ive always loved the soft feel after coloring, but that does not happen with this brand, my hair felt brittle, dry, and knotted really easy.</li>
            <li>So I was a HUGE fan of Healthy Look for a very long time, then they changed the formula or something.</li>
            <li>so Im glad I ran across Healthy Look because its less damaging.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the color of my hair, and love that it is super shiny for at least a week or so after coloring.  </li>
            <li>This was my first try</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I watched the video, read the directions and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>I may use another dye that has more of an ash blonde.</li>
            <li>First of all the box showed that a darker brown hair color could achieve a lighter color.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used a box colour.  </li>
            <li>The healthy look gloss actually made my hair feel \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>That being said, I found it easy to use, and my hair came out soft and VERY shiny.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and fast!! :)</li>
            <li>For using this for the first time for coloring my hair, it is not dramatic at all.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after coloring was that my hair was very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use the dark chestnut shades because they come out so rich, and so shiny, and truly healthy looking.</li>
            <li>my hair tends to damage easy so this product help improve overall appearance and texture.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product because I have had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal hair color in the past.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this product unless you really don&#x27;t care what your hair looks like, smells like or feels like when you are done using it.</li>
            <li>I was VERY suprised reading through reviews to the contrary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair 20 times and it&#x27;s been in my hair for over a month and has not lightened much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it helped relax the frizz a whole lot.</li>
            <li>It is still very shiny and has not faded.  </li>
            <li>My roots turned orange, and the rest of my hair turned a dark rusty colour, nowhere near the nice ashy medium brown I chose.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give my (premature) grays that baboon&#x27;s ass red quality so many brands of similar colors do.</li>
            <li>The color seems less harsh than permanent color like L&#x27;Oreal Preference or Nice N Easy.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomment this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, creamy, thick dye, but it sure is a mess nonetheless.</li>
            <li>i started on the top of my hair but the bottom turned out a little nicer</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try - the color that you are supposed to get is exactly my natural color (without all the grays!!).  </li>
            <li>Will stick to my normal brand that doesnt make me feel like ive damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually use a light blonde shade by natural instincts but thought I&#x27;d be adventurous and try something new (the shade on the box (</li>
            <li>Just colored my hair five days ago with this new product.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair for years with Loreal products and thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for many years and never liked a  product this much.</li>
            <li>I used Light Brown/Chocolate Praline for my medium to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on dark hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you&#x27;re blonde, don&#x27;t take any chances!  </li>
            <li>Stay far, far away from this one!</li>
            <li>8.5) looked like a gorgeous sunlit blonde, but when I rinsed I was horrified to see that my hair was a vey DULL ASH GRAY (sort of like CEMENT!) .</li>
            <li>It was a complete disaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for years, both at home and professionally.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t last on grays</li>
            <li>I work out and wash my hair at least 5 times a week, and the Healthy Look color lasts about 4 weeks for me, which is about what I would expect.    </li>
            <li>but it fixed the orange and the rust.</li>
            <li>She also noticed that the color lasts very well and didn&#x27;t fade quickly like Natural Instincts had for her in the past.   </li>
            <li>Right now, the color looks like it should, but it is still wet.</li>
            <li>Frankly, if my hair turned out black, I would have been lucky.</li>
            <li>Get over it -- no hair color in the world, not even the most expensive salon treatment -- is going to give a consistent color result on every person&#x27;s hair, in every climate or condition, type of tap water, etc.  </li>
            <li>I used Soft Golden Blonde, and I actually feel like it came out darker and brought the red out.</li>
            <li>I had gorgeous shiny dark brown hair with a little bit of grey in it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping after another wash it will go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I thought this product had the least offensive smell of any I have used, and it rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li>It kinda turned my natural dark blond hair a little lighter on top for some reason, like a reddish tent.</li>
            <li>I was nervous after reading all the other reviews, but I purchased two boxes and did a strand test first.</li>
            <li>My hair looks SO unhealthy right now I am stuck with this for the next month - I don&#x27;t dare put any other product on top of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Excellence for years (Soft Ash Brown, 6aa), I tried this product (chocolate praline) last night and my hair is</li>
            <li>The colour turned out WAY darker than the picture, and I&#x27;ve washed my hair with baking soda twice and it barely faded at all.</li>
            <li>My natural color is strawberry blonde, but it has gotten a little \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I get older, so I was looking for something to birghten the tone.  </li>
            <li>Well, Vanilla Creme turned my shiny, soft, light beige blonde hair into a dull dark ash gray.  </li>
            <li>This one seemed to be fairly neutral and unlikely to turn out all to close to a black shade on my hair.</li>
            <li>but if you keep it in even a little bit longer it will be MUCH darker then what its suppose to be.</li>

            <li> I used Light Brown/Chocolate Praline for my medium to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on dark hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you&#x27;re blonde, don&#x27;t take any chances!  </li>
            <li> Stay far, far away from this one!</li>
            <li> 8.5) looked like a gorgeous sunlit blonde, but when I rinsed I was horrified to see that my hair was a vey DULL ASH GRAY (sort of like CEMENT!) .</li>
            <li> It was a complete disaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years, both at home and professionally.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t last on grays</li>
            <li> I work out and wash my hair at least 5 times a week, and the Healthy Look color lasts about 4 weeks for me, which is about what I would expect.    </li>
            <li> but it fixed the orange and the rust.</li>
            <li> She also noticed that the color lasts very well and didn&#x27;t fade quickly like Natural Instincts had for her in the past.   </li>
            <li> Right now, the color looks like it should, but it is still wet.</li>
            <li> Frankly, if my hair turned out black, I would have been lucky.</li>
            <li> Get over it -- no hair color in the world, not even the most expensive salon treatment -- is going to give a consistent color result on every person&#x27;s hair, in every climate or condition, type of tap water, etc.  </li>
            <li> I used Soft Golden Blonde, and I actually feel like it came out darker and brought the red out.</li>
            <li> I had gorgeous shiny dark brown hair with a little bit of grey in it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping after another wash it will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I thought this product had the least offensive smell of any I have used, and it rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li> It kinda turned my natural dark blond hair a little lighter on top for some reason, like a reddish tent.</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading all the other reviews, but I purchased two boxes and did a strand test first.</li>
            <li> My hair looks SO unhealthy right now I am stuck with this for the next month - I don&#x27;t dare put any other product on top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Excellence for years (Soft Ash Brown, 6aa), I tried this product (chocolate praline) last night and my hair is</li>
            <li> The colour turned out WAY darker than the picture, and I&#x27;ve washed my hair with baking soda twice and it barely faded at all.</li>
            <li> My natural color is strawberry blonde, but it has gotten a little \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I get older, so I was looking for something to birghten the tone.  </li>
            <li> Well, Vanilla Creme turned my shiny, soft, light beige blonde hair into a dull dark ash gray.  </li>
            <li> This one seemed to be fairly neutral and unlikely to turn out all to close to a black shade on my hair.</li>
            <li> but if you keep it in even a little bit longer it will be MUCH darker then what its suppose to be.</li>
            <li> But first you&#x27;ll have to deal with the fact that it looks like you murdered someone in your bathroom, or at least tried to cut them up in your bathtub afterwards.</li>
            <li> Since I have some grey I left the color on for 15 mins after applications.......</li>
            <li> Just spent the last half hour rinsing out my eyes and tossing a brand new contact lens - I think this product touts itself as no-drip</li>
            <li> My hair came out darker than expected and the roots were inhomogeneously covered, even tho I left on roots for 10 minutes instead of suggested 5.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t get over that I don&#x27;t have any grey in my hair.</li>
            <li> My roots came out the exact same color that they were before and worst of all my hair feels dry and more coarse than before!  </li>
            <li> My hair is now very dark brown almost black, that part doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal could not have gotten it more WRONG!  </li>
            <li> It last longer than any other hair color I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After one year, after the hairdresser dyed my hair dark brown because there was nothing else she could do to get rid of the rusty red hues, my hair is a medium rust color now.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Healthy Look hair coloring smells bad and left my hair dried out.  </li>
            <li> the color bears absolutely NO resemblance to the color on the box.  </li>
            <li> It smells like wet sheep -- I assume it is lanolin based or something.  </li>
            <li> and I bought the dark blonde, and my hair came out a dark brown!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to tone down the blonde a little, but cried when I saw these results.  </li>
            <li> Now I have dull, lifeless, dark brown hair with the same amount of grey in it.  </li>
            <li> For those who are upset the color is not exactly like the color on the box?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s PEROXIDE, or in other words BLEACH.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday due to the heat.i have really dry wavy hair</li>
            <li> Previously I always spent $100 at the salon.  </li>
            <li> so she gave me a really dark, almost black brown.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re coloring at home for less than $10 a pop --</li>
            <li> I will admit that the color came out a little darker than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> It is SOOOO dark and burgundy!  </li>
            <li> a little cause</li>
            <li> I always go a shade or two lighter for non-permanent colors since they can come out very dark.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that this is the worst product out there.</li>
            <li> It even covered  a few grays.</li>
            <li> My hair does not have a dried out feeling to it - it even feels silky.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m constantly aware of the awful smell that resembles cat urine and poo at the same time.</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars anyway, but would give 4.5 if I could, just for that small drawback.  </li>
            <li> I just used the Medium brown and it made my hair BLACK!!</li>
            <li> I found this hard to apply, needing two hands to squeeze the bottle as the product is quite sticky.</li>
            <li> have been coloring my hair at home for at least 15 years now</li>
            <li> The smell was the least obnoxious of any color I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The dye was very thick like and hard to get through to all of my head and hair</li>
            <li> After a few years though, I got bored of this colour</li>
            <li> Worse, my roots are orange.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin and very soft so its horrible to feel it how it is now.</li>
            <li> Maybe the previous reviewer got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I made the silly choice of trying a semi-permanent box color again.</li>
            <li> completely, completely black, I look like a witch, just awful.</li>
            <li> I will never use this product again and recommend that no one take the risk of this dangerous and unsatisfactory product.</li>
            <li> I now have to use a hair removal kit to remove this horrible color and dye my hair all over again, what a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Since they are both L&#x27;Oreal products, I decided to try it - how bad could it be?  </li>
            <li> I bought it in part because it contains no ammonia, but somehow it leaves your hair smelling bad days after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I just used it and the smell makes me feel sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> I HATE</li>

            <li> This is a terrible product!!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t match the color on the box and the conditioner smells absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So I was a HUGE fan of Healthy Look for a very long time, then they changed the formula or something. This color turned my gray roots bright orange and left my brown hair with a strage orange hue. I&#x27;m very dissapointed and won&#x27;t use Healthy Look again. I could always count on good gray coverage and soft hair from this brand. That is no longer the case. My hair feels like straw.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Feria user, but I fell for the tv ad for this product.  Since they are both L&#x27;Oreal products, I decided to try it - how bad could it be?  Well, Vanilla Creme turned my shiny, soft, light beige blonde hair into a dull dark ash gray.  I wanted to tone down the blonde a little, but cried when I saw these results.  My hair looks SO unhealthy right now I am stuck with this for the next month - I don&#x27;t dare put any other product on top of it. L&#x27;Oreal needs to take this product off the market!  Maybe it works better on dark hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you&#x27;re blonde, don&#x27;t take any chances!  I will stick with Feria from now on - the color is very natural looking and my hair looks beautiful and healthy with the Feria product.</li>
            <li> Does the job, is a nice color. If your hair is already red....and you cannot find a red to get a nice shade...use this. Even though it is chestnut brown....it will really give you a beautiful color....not &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; at all. BUT your hair has to be red already!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Healthy Look hair coloring smells bad and left my hair dried out.  The color also does not match what the box says it is.  I used L&#x27;oreal ColorSpa for years and this product was supposed to be the replacement when L&#x27;Oreal discontinued Color Spa.  L&#x27;oreal could not have gotten it more WRONG!  Don&#x27;t use this product unless you really don&#x27;t care what your hair looks like, smells like or feels like when you are done using it.</li>
            <li> I just used the Medium brown and it made my hair BLACK!! I had to use a color removal kit and recolor my hair. This is a terrible product!! Do not buy this. This was my first try and I will never do it again. I will stick with Revlon Colorsilk. You can trust the color and it is prices 1/2 of this product.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product because I have had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal hair color in the past. I used Light Brown/Chocolate Praline for my medium to dark brown hair. I always go a shade or two lighter for non-permanent colors since they can come out very dark. This one seemed to be fairly neutral and unlikely to turn out all to close to a black shade on my hair. Frankly, if my hair turned out black, I would have been lucky. Instead I ended up with a head full of orange hair (that I had to cover with a better product) and the stinky-stink smell did not come out for days. It was a complete disaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been coloring my hair at home for at least 15 years now and I can honestly say that this is the worst product out there. Stay far, far away from this one!</li>
            <li> My hair is a light brown and I bought the dark blonde, and my hair came out a dark brown!  I will never buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  I combed it through and left it on for 15 minutes.  I had gorgeous shiny dark brown hair with a little bit of grey in it.  Now I have dull, lifeless, dark brown hair with the same amount of grey in it.  I pray that this is truly temporary color and that I have my beautiful hair back in 6 weeks.  I HATE HATE HATE this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it in part because it contains no ammonia, but somehow it leaves your hair smelling bad days after you&#x27;ve used it. I also noticed I broke out in a rash when I was rinsing in the shower. I will never use this product again and recommend that no one take the risk of this dangerous and unsatisfactory product.</li>
            <li> I have been paying to color my hair for the last 30 years until today.....A friend suggested that I try L&#x27;Oreal Healthy Color so I did!!  I selected a color close to what I have my stylist use.......Chestnut Brown 5CB.... I watched the video, read the directions and followed them exactly. Since I have some grey I left the color on for 15 mins after applications.......No bad smell, no burning, no stinging.....and my hair looks GREAT !!!    I cannot believe how great this product is and I will keep using it and save $100 every 6 weeks.....</li>
            <li> I made the silly choice of trying a semi-permanent box color again. I have been using Clairol Radiance Colorgloss for some time, but saw this on sale. I just used it and the smell makes me feel sick to my stomach. Like cat urine. I even washed my hair and reconditioned with another product and can still smell it. I will never buy again, even if after my hair dries it looks amazing. Right now, the color looks like it should, but it is still wet.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t match the color on the box and the conditioner smells absolutely horrible. I can&#x27;t get rid of the smell for days now and I&#x27;m constantly aware of the awful smell that resembles cat urine and poo at the same time. Don&#x27;t get it if you don&#x27;t want to be embarrassed by your own smell!</li>
            <li> Cat piss is a very unique scent, so you&#x27;ll have to wonder if the makers of the conditioner emulated it. Then you&#x27;ll wonder why. But first you&#x27;ll have to deal with the fact that it looks like you murdered someone in your bathroom, or at least tried to cut them up in your bathtub afterwards. It&#x27;s a nice, creamy, thick dye, but it sure is a mess nonetheless. Now onto the most important part: the color. I used spiced praline (light reddish brown) and like it quite a bit. It doesn&#x27;t give my (premature) grays that baboon&#x27;s ass red quality so many brands of similar colors do. I will use it again, but I&#x27;m going to be wearing a poncho and a gas mask.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the color came out a little darker than I had hoped for. My natural color is strawberry blonde, but it has gotten a little \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I get older, so I was looking for something to birghten the tone.  I used Soft Golden Blonde, and I actually feel like it came out darker and brought the red out. I think it looks great, but I would have preferred a lighter result as pictured on the box.  That being said, I found it easy to use, and my hair came out soft and VERY shiny.  I have colored my hair for years, both at home and professionally.  I thought this product had the least offensive smell of any I have used, and it rinsed out easily.  I was VERY suprised reading through reviews to the contrary.  Maybe they have just improved the formula.  Anyway, I like it a lot-just wish there were a shade lighter available.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years using L&#x27;oreal 6rb light reddish brown and it&#x27;s been good but during the summer gets too light too quickly.  I decided to try 5R healthy look (just one shade darker supposedly)... the color bears absolutely NO resemblance to the color on the box.  It is SOOOO dark and burgundy!  BURGUNDY like a glass of red wine (as my friends teased when i met them just after dying.) Worse, my roots are orange. I cannot believe how untrue the color is... I have no idea what to do now... VERY DISSATISFIED!!!</li>
            <li> This product has great conditioner and all but if you keep it in even a little bit longer it will be MUCH darker then what its suppose to be.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t last on grays</li>
            <li> Just colored my hair five days ago with this new product. I am very happy with the color, I have never been a redhead, but I like it. I was please with the application ease only 10 minute It even covered  a few grays. The conditioner was great , made my hair shiney amd soft. I have been coloring my hair for many years and never liked a  product this much.</li>
            <li> Been coloring for years, and trying Healthy Look was my first in the 10-minute, semi-permanent realm.  I LOVE the color of my hair, and love that it is super shiny for at least a week or so after coloring.  I have now used both Spiced Tuffle and Iced Chocolate.  The color seems less harsh than permanent color like L&#x27;Oreal Preference or Nice N Easy.  I work out and wash my hair at least 5 times a week, and the Healthy Look color lasts about 4 weeks for me, which is about what I would expect.    The only drawback of this product for me is the smell of the conditioner.  It smells like wet sheep -- I assume it is lanolin based or something.  This is not enough to make me stop using it -- I just use a different conditioner I have on hand, or (if I don&#x27;t have to see anyone the day I color) just grin and bear the smell.  Thinking I may even start trying to cover it by adding lavendar oil or something else that smells strong but good.  I give 5 stars anyway, but would give 4.5 if I could, just for that small drawback.  For those who are upset the color is not exactly like the color on the box?  Get over it -- no hair color in the world, not even the most expensive salon treatment -- is going to give a consistent color result on every person&#x27;s hair, in every climate or condition, type of tap water, etc.  You&#x27;re coloring at home for less than $10 a pop -- do a strand test, follow the timing directions, and have fun with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Excellence for years (Soft Ash Brown, 6aa), I tried this product (chocolate praline) last night and my hair is completely, completely black, I look like a witch, just awful. I now have to use a hair removal kit to remove this horrible color and dye my hair all over again, what a waste of time and money. L&#x27;oreal should take this product off the market, it does not work.  Mary, Boston, MA</li>
            <li> Just spent the last half hour rinsing out my eyes and tossing a brand new contact lens - I think this product touts itself as no-drip but it dripped all over the place, including my eye and floor.  Plastic glove broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR COLOR WORKS FOR ME AND IT COVERS THE GRAY.  THIS DEAL WAS GREAT ...I HOPE HE HAS THE SAME DEAL NEXT MONTH. IT ALWAYS COMES ON TIME.</li>
            <li> The colour turned out WAY darker than the picture, and I&#x27;ve washed my hair with baking soda twice and it barely faded at all. I&#x27;ve washed my hair 20 times and it&#x27;s been in my hair for over a month and has not lightened much. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of L&#x27;Oreal Excellence (I especially like the multi-prong applicator),  so wanted to try another L&#x27;Oreal product without ammonia for touch-ups.  I found this hard to apply, needing two hands to squeeze the bottle as the product is quite sticky. My hair came out darker than expected and the roots were inhomogeneously covered, even tho I left on roots for 10 minutes instead of suggested 5.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It kinda turned my natural dark blond hair a little lighter on top for some reason, like a reddish tent. its like the longer you keep it on the lighter it gets. Over all though it put some dimension of colors into it which was nice.I also liked the bee pollen treatment. I dont like the smell of the conditioner. For using this for the first time for coloring my hair, it is not dramatic at all. I really liked it. Its time to do it again soon though maybe before 28 days cause I wash my hair everyday due to the heat.i have really dry wavy hair and it helped relax the frizz a whole lot. I love how it did that. Yes I would use it again over any foam products because of the no ammonia in it. my hair tends to damage easy so this product help improve overall appearance and texture. Maybe it turned it lighter a little cause it has hydrogen peroxide. i started on the top of my hair but the bottom turned out a little nicer but you cant notice a difference unless you look at it. I may use another dye that has more of an ash blonde. Maybe a more ask color with darken it just a tad better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and fast!! :)</li>
            <li> They came promptly and were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had used this on her hair and it turned out to be a beautiful natural color - exactly the same color as the model on the box!  She also noticed that the color lasts very well and didn&#x27;t fade quickly like Natural Instincts had for her in the past.   I decided to give it a try - the color that you are supposed to get is exactly my natural color (without all the grays!!).  It turned out a bit more redddish than I thought it would be, but not a bad result - it still looks natural and the grays just look like highlights.  The smell was the least obnoxious of any color I have ever used.  Maybe the previous reviewer got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell (compared to other hair colors).  It takes 10 minutes.  It colors gray great.  My hair does not have a dried out feeling to it - it even feels silky.  The first thing I noticed after coloring was that my hair was very shiny.  I thought - I&#x27;ll see how it is in 6 weeks.  It is still very shiny and has not faded.  I only have to color because my roots are showing.</li>
            <li> This hair color is awful!  I have been dying my hair for years with Loreal products and thought I&#x27;d try something new.  First of all the box showed that a darker brown hair color could achieve a lighter color.  This was not the case for me!  The dye was very thick like and hard to get through to all of my head and hair and I had no change of color whatsoever!  My roots came out the exact same color that they were before and worst of all my hair feels dry and more coarse than before!  I will never buy this hair dye again!!</li>
            <li> I love Healthy Look Chestnut Brown. It looks just like the shade I was born with. My mother doesn&#x27;t know I color my hair. She can&#x27;t get over that I don&#x27;t have any grey in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used a box colour.  Previously I always spent $100 at the salon.  I was very pleased at the results for under $10. L&#x27;oreal Healthy Look 5CB - Chestnut Brown was so easy to use.  10 minutes and I was done.  I will however try leaving the colour on additional 5 minutes (15 minutes total) on my roots.  It has a auburn brown look to it ... if you are looking for a touch of auburn then this is your colour.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived super-fast and exactly as described :)</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading all the other reviews, but I purchased two boxes and did a strand test first. I think it just depends on what color your hair is before applying this product because my hair came out just like the image on the box. The healthy look gloss actually made my hair feel \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;! I have done every color you can image to my hair, which has left it brittle so Im glad I ran across Healthy Look because its less damaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color ever since it was introduced on the market. I mainly use the dark chestnut shades because they come out so rich, and so shiny, and truly healthy looking. After a few years though, I got bored of this colour so I decided to go with a lighter, cooler brown colour, like a light cool ash brown, and that&#x27;s when the disasters started. My roots turned orange, and the rest of my hair turned a dark rusty colour, nowhere near the nice ashy medium brown I chose. In order to fix it, I bought the chestnut color again and it turned out ok, a bit lighter at the roots but it fixed the orange and the rust. But, that&#x27;s not what what I wanted. I wanted to lighten my hair to light brown. So I went to the hair dresser and she could not get the rust out of my hair using double ash so she gave me a really dark, almost black brown. Again, that&#x27;s not what I wanted. The hair salon said that the problem is the hair color I used at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I called L&#x27;Oreal and explained my situation. The rep. said that although the product is not permanent, doesn&#x27;t contain ammonia,  and it washes out in 28 shampoos, it does contain PEROXIDE. So what it did was it bleached my hair to a rusty orange colour so that the chestnut color could go on top. The L&#x27;Oreal rep. said that peroxide is permanent and the only way to get rid of it is to grow out your hair and cut it. Now I did not expect that from a non-permanent, wash out in 28 shampoos haircolor and i wanted to write this review to let everyone know that this haircolor makes a PERMANENT change to your hair and you can&#x27;t fix it. It&#x27;s PEROXIDE, or in other words BLEACH. I got this information from a L&#x27;Oreal rep. After one year, after the hairdresser dyed my hair dark brown because there was nothing else she could do to get rid of the rusty red hues, my hair is a medium rust color now. So the peroxide effects are still visible in my hair and I haven&#x27;t even tried to change the color since then. I won&#x27;t buy it again, the results were nice but I don&#x27;t want them to be permanent.e nice but I don&#x27;t want them to be permanent.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for many years and have gotten to be quite the pro at it. I usually use a light blonde shade by natural instincts but thought I&#x27;d be adventurous and try something new (the shade on the box (8.5) looked like a gorgeous sunlit blonde, but when I rinsed I was horrified to see that my hair was a vey DULL ASH GRAY (sort of like CEMENT!) . I had to use a color remover and re-do my hair! Never sgsin, bad stuff!!!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. No breakage on fine hair and easy . The only issue is that last order seemed to be the last four in stock</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got Great coverage! &#x27;Love it&#x27;!&#x27; It last longer than any other hair color I&#x27;ve used. I highly reccomment this product.</li>
            <li> So i decided to give this a try because of the chocolatey shades. I got a medium brown and left it on for around 15 mins. My hair is now very dark brown almost black, that part doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. Its the feeling of my hair, ive always loved the soft feel after coloring, but that does not happen with this brand, my hair felt brittle, dry, and knotted really easy. Ive just coloured so I&#x27;m hoping after another wash it will go back to normal. My hair is naturally thin and very soft so its horrible to feel it how it is now. Will stick to my normal brand that doesnt make me feel like ive damaged my hair.</li>
