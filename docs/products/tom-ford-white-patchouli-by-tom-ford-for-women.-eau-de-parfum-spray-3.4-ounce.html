            <li>My favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it would be more of a floral.  </li>
            <li>My co-workers said they love the sent on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many perfumes, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most comparable to Fresh&#x27;s Cannabis Rose, which doesn&#x27;t turn on me.</li>
            <li>It is really strong</li>
            <li>I love it smell&#x27;s very fresh and clean.  </li>

            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>and I am glad to see it back in the stores and on line.</li>
            <li>I love Tom Ford and this is one of my favorite fragrancies and hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this fragrance to work.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents not over powering like some other patchouli oils and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>peace, love, bell bottoms, black leather, Jim Morrison and victory.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for a few years now and I love it.</li>
            <li>My wife has found a new friend in Tom Ford after years of being a Chanel girl.</li>
            <li>Guys get your gal to try it in a store first, as perfumes are individual.  </li>

            <li> If she likes it, it is an expensive but fantastic gift.  </li>
            <li> This I&#x27;d one of those fragrances that you must put on long before you leave the house.  </li>
            <li> I was devastated when my suitcase was broken into on my last flight from Africa to the States and one of the items stolen was a practically new bottle of Tom Ford, White Patchouli!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Rated four star for the fact the wife is addicted to it and to find Tom Ford brand is difficult in many department stores and botiques.</li>
            <li> Finishes nasty and weak on me, anyway.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear this scent without both men and women commenting on it (drives men crazy!)</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worst purchase I&#x27;ve made through amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Great price! I cannot wear this scent without both men and women commenting on it (drives men crazy!) it&#x27;s been my signature scent since &#x27;09.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  Starts off strong, but settles in nicely.</li>
            <li> It was just what she wanted!</li>
            <li> White Patchouli is hands down my favorite perfume, I am happy I can get it on Amazon. I wish I could find the body lotion and bath gel!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! The girls at work complemented me on the perfume, and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> My wife has found a new friend in Tom Ford after years of being a Chanel girl. I think this smells pretty good too, but in the end if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and since she&#x27;s happy I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it! Great price too!</li>
            <li> I went into Saks Fifth Avenue in Palm Desert and smelled all the different fragrances.  Loved this one!!!  Won a Gift Card as a raffle prize for $100.00 at Amazon, so this was the perfect gift to myself.  I always get a lot of compliments when I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> I truly adore the incredible richness of this scent! its definitely an upgrade from our mom&#x27;s or grandmom&#x27;s version of patchouli.</li>
            <li> What are you wearing will be a regular question</li>
            <li> I bought from a third party seller and regret it. This was not white patchouli, it was some cheapo men&#x27;s cologne. Really disappointed. I had a sample and the two are nothing alike. Absolutely worst purchase I&#x27;ve made through amazon.</li>
            <li> Finishes nasty and weak on me, anyway. After wearing it for about four hours, I just want to go home and wash it off of me because it has &amp;#34;turned&amp;#34; so.  I like the way it starts out, though. What a shame. I really wanted this fragrance to work. It&#x27;s most comparable to Fresh&#x27;s Cannabis Rose, which doesn&#x27;t turn on me.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.  The product is authentic and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Rated four star for the fact the wife is addicted to it and to find Tom Ford brand is difficult in many department stores and botiques.</li>
            <li> This scent will send you somewhere wonderful.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent.  Guys get your gal to try it in a store first, as perfumes are individual.  If she likes it, it is an expensive but fantastic gift.  Well worth the extra money.  My wife gets compliments often, and people will ask her what she is wearing.</li>
            <li> I love Tom Ford and this is one of my favorite fragrancies and hard to find.  Ordering and receiving was a great experience.</li>
            <li> This I&#x27;d one of those fragrances that you must put on long before you leave the house.  It is really strong and I thought it would be more of a floral.  NOT</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents not over powering like some other patchouli oils and perfumes.  It was discontinued for awhile but has been brought back and I am glad to see it back in the stores and on line.</li>
            <li> I love it smell&#x27;s very fresh and clean.  My co-workers said they love the sent on me.</li>

            <li> My wife smells like 1967......peace, love, bell bottoms, black leather, Jim Morrison and victory. It&#x27;s her favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many perfumes, but not this one. I love the scent, and receive many compliments when I wear it. A little bit goes a long way, and it lasts all day.</li>
