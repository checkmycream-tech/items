            <li>/&gt;Update:  Amazingly, this product lasted me 10 months!  </li>
            <li>This product was amazing until makers changed it !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look real healthy and dewy.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this, I&#x27;ve really liked it!</li>
            <li>For most days though, this is perfect!</li>
            <li>Really nice moisturier!</li>
            <li>Pleasant moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very good item, cheap in my opinion and works wonders!</li>
            <li>Then I began shopping around for a good anti-aging moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be fair to give this item one star.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of some of the good reviews</li>
            <li>The package arrive in 3 business days and in good condition, however the product expiration date is 8/2015 just 3 months from now.</li>
            <li>One of the best product available in market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>Good results for the money.</li>
            <li>People tell me I hold my looks good</li>
            <li>I always loved Olay products..</li>
            <li>My mother in law loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now with good results.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>Feels good, not greasy, protects my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good one with SPF for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cc cream and night cream from olay, and they were both good.</li>
            <li>It is effective, odorless and works great on my face.</li>
            <li>It might be good to use during summer time.</li>
            <li>I just wish it were as good for me in the summer</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference (a good one) after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Olay</li>
            <li>They are a good value compared to the department store brands.  </li>
            <li>she loved it.....</li>
            <li>Good for those of us over 35.</li>
            <li>, I purchased at Costco - loved it, it was lightweight, and I did not break out, and I went on to use it for years.  </li>
            <li>protects skin, smells good.</li>
            <li>olay always provides good products with good prices.</li>
            <li>This is a good line and product.  </li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, silky and rich but doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>(I am very fair skinned and burn easily) -- it has prevented a lot of sun damage.</li>
            <li>This one is exceptional..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s a really great product, love the SPF in it also.</li>
            <li>spf makes it smell not so good and doesn&#x27;t go on as nice a the one without spf</li>
            <li>Love, love it!!</li>
            <li>I love rhis product!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love the SPF that protects my face all day!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy over and over!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this !</li>
            <li>I started noticing a change within the first week itself and I absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the SPF is a bonus!</li>
            <li>I love that it is unscented!</li>
            <li>Truly love this!</li>
            <li>You will love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed as it seemed to address all my needs.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>and I look forward to using it more!</li>
            <li>It is very light and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing if you use it as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After seeing all the supposedly amazing benefits of this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I guess thats for effective sun protection.</li>
            <li>No acne and just really nice looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I even saw a nice improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about UV rays when I have this on as well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Amazon for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Of course it won&#x27;t stop the aging process, but it does make your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely, keeps my face moisturized without being greasy, and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>when it dries it kind of wipes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to apply SPF and lotion</li>
            <li>Kept my skin feeling nice all day.</li>
            <li>spf versions do not play well with makeups foundations or tinted creams of any kind that I have found; causes pilling and flaking.</li>
            <li>I liked this product as it worked at the time, but it contains alcohol</li>
            <li>It was otherwise an excellent product with a nice texture, moisturized perfectly without being too heavy to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not anything outstanding.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin and want a nice glow throughout the day I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li>It felt so good and makes me feel safe that it has SPF 15</li>
            <li>My skin looked nice than it ever has.</li>
            <li>It made me look orange kind of.</li>
            <li>First off, I love Oil of Olay products they are great!</li>
            <li>I loved it but the scent was way to strong.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my very sensitive, rosacea-prone, over 50 skin.  </li>
            <li>I like the SPF 15 also since I sunburn very easily.</li>
            <li>It smells very strongly like sun lotion.</li>
            <li>so I break out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I have never felt better! :)</li>
            <li>Olay is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best that I have used.</li>
            <li>This is great for me,doesn&#x27;t take forever to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>The most effective Vitamin C in cosmetic products is Asorbic Acid.</li>
            <li>It has effective amounts of niacinamide (a really potent cell communicating anti ager) and sunscreen, and no scent which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all women that are looking for a day moisturizer, I have tried all brands from Chanel, Lanc√¥me, Dior, ect, and I found that this product is the most effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>Just what I ordered and very quick!  </li>
            <li>Easy all in one !&lt;</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free, i am very allergic and it has worked awesome.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for the summers and temperatures where it&#x27;s just hot.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true . . .</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth and gives me that \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>We are both very fair and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The description says it&#x27;s unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin--dry and oily but mostly oily--and this moisturizer worked well with my skin type.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but not with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I reccommend trying this product and leaving it on for 2-3 days before deeming it safe.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay brand and have been using Olay products.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I will buy it any more.</li>
            <li>I love the sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>My wife love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it is on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will probably change that to every 3 months since the product has impressed me and now know that I will be using it daily.</li>
            <li>Cream is light and effective - been using it for years</li>
            <li>I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash.</li>
            <li>but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>And Im so glad to have it on automatic delivery frim Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I love that it&#x27;s unscented, that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li>This is the cheapest I have ever been able to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of months now, and felt that my skin was looking better</li>
            <li>used for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>but I like this moisturizer so much better.      </li>
            <li>I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After i bought this found better price at costco..</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Been using Olay for many years.</li>
            <li>When I abuse it, this lotion makes it feel better.  </li>
            <li>the Regenerist may be slightly better forcoloration issues, but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years I love the way it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li>I make sure that I exfoliate before use and voila - perfectly smooth and dewy skin!</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels and how my makeup goes on over this.  </li>
            <li>but I do see it making my skin look more youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li>either of us have ever been able to find that&#x27;s worked, ever.</li>
            <li>But most of the creams promise that effect and none hold it.</li>
            <li>I kept using thinking my skin would get used to it, used most of the bottle with no change.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work okay as sunscreen, but it causes breakouts (acne) for me.</li>
            <li>The price when on sale is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is one of my top two favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love that it also has SPF 15.</li>
            <li>most AcneFree products)</li>
            <li>In addition, all of the paraben studies were conducted on people who already have cancer and not on people who are healthy.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love OTE.</li>

            <li>Love the feel of this lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>It just okay.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it unless I find something I like better</li>
            <li>I like that this product is on the safe to use list according to Environmental Working Group guide to safe cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros - night cream is better than the day and provides hydration without provoking acne/redness.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this anti-aging moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And my forehead lines seem better too.</li>
            <li>It can feel more like sunscreen than lotion.</li>
            <li>but this is one of my favorite products from them.</li>
            <li>I love my Olay products.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite moisturizer in years.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I&#x27;m going to try to go</li>
            <li>am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount</li>
            <li>, I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this.  </li>
            <li>Many days I have to blot it off.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 months, I got so many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I think Neutrogena and Roc products are ok.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like Olay takes care of more than just wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I think I would not buy it again because I did not fell in love with it</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, wish it had more firming properties</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>This is more of a sunscreen than a lotion.</li>
            <li>It really is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>, I noticed that the SPF 15 was available once again!  </li>
            <li>So I need to get something more targeted to deal with that.</li>
            <li>so than if you use a sponge (better for your skin anyway).</li>
            <li>I love having the bonus UV protection.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I saw it recommended on another website as a best choice for facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used it for many months with no issues.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I did love it and</li>
            <li>Love purchasing Olay products with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>anything that purports to do what a serum does and more (antioxidants, brightening, even skin tone)  </li>
            <li>okay as face lotions go</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Used Olay for more than 40 years and switched to Clinique.  </li>
            <li>And, it does smooth out the wrinkles.  !</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; great product I use it day &amp; night</li>
            <li>My wife uses it always, It is a good product and the price is right compared to stores</li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels great, and I do love the \\&quot;scent free\\&quot; because it kind of smells like sunscreen (SPF 15 in it) which I love because psychologically it makes me feel like I am on vacation</li>
            <li>Olay with sunscreen was amazing; no irritation...sunscreen...a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Pretty good moisturizer for the price and ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Used to give a nice cool feeling when applied now</li>
            <li>This product is a nice moisturizer but hasnt done anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li>As effective and much more cost effective than comparable high end department store items.</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to apply, with the special push-cap.</li>
            <li>while i haven&#x27;t noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a very good price for this product, so I see no need to run around trying to catch it on sale locally.  </li>
            <li>Over the years that cream has been great on my sensitive, ruddy, rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>As far as moisturizer goes, it was great, did the job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sticking with just the fragrance free day and night version of this product, and I have to say while I love the one intended for night</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with the presentation and texture of the cream.</li>
            <li>Neva too early to take precautions lol</li>
            <li>So far this is great</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone that wants a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad scent, it sort of reminds me of a high-end perfume, but very light.  </li>
            <li>One of the most economical of the Olay products in retail, purchase here provides even more cost savings.  </li>
            <li>The dispencer is easy to \\&quot;squeeze\\</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is easy to use with the pump.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>, I doubt the CDC would allow parabens to side that easily.</li>
            <li>I can moisturize my face and apply sunscreen in one easy step.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have not seen any evening, brightening features, but is a good decent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>i love Olay products and this one is perfect for aging skin/ use everyday on fine wrinkles and it WORKS...</li>
            <li>Smells good and does an okay job, but for the price, its not conquering any major skin issues.  </li>
            <li>consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply, it&#x27;s very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist UV and aging!</li>
            <li>and this works fine</li>
            <li>Minimize the appearance of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to its anti-aging qualities because I am 20, and do not have fine lines or wrinkles, though I have been using it as a &amp;#34;preventative medicine&amp;#34; of sorts.  </li>
            <li>I saw this 7 in 1 product and saw that it had a tint in it, and SPF, and took away fine lines, and it might help with my ruddy complexion, so I paid the $21 and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have a combination skin with some fine lines.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will be fine.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s totally fine for any age.</li>
            <li>The lotion helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and even pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m 40 and started noticing some fine lines/wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>My face went from being a mess to smooth, radiant and dare I say perfect.</li>
            <li>the SPF is a huge bonus since I don&#x27;t like wearing our sunscreen but one has to to prevent premature aging.</li>
            <li>Smooth, non-greasy, product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about, but otherwise I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Male user here, and it makes a great post-shave lotion on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance FREE -</li>
            <li>/&gt;6) Defense against free radicals</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using this product because it is fragrance free</li>
            <li>it is a nice gentle sunscreen,</li>
            <li>I think this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall great investment.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for two years, it is comfortable lightweight and helps protect against sun damage.  </li>
            <li>My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect combination of moisturizer and SPF protection for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to be with my Olay moisturizer again once back home and won&#x27;t be found without it again!  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle-free.  </li>
            <li>I know I sound like a girl.</li>
            <li>Effective product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would put on a light coat over my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light feeling and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I like the light consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>It gives skin a smooth glow.</li>
            <li>&quot; Given that these are anti-aging products, and I (and I think most women) use them around the eyes, it is a warning worth noting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my skin went from acne prone, blackheads, and spots to smooth radiant skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to apply SPF every day, even in the summer, and so I do.</li>
            <li>It does not give the silky smooth finish Olay cream is renound for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also meant to be fragrance free</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on great, isn&#x27;t greasy and has an SPF which we ladies should use daily.</li>
            <li>The pump is nice because it helps prevent pouring out too much at once.</li>
            <li>It blends in efforlessly and makes my face feel moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Almost a year later, I still use it and my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer with lots of extra benefits - SPF 15.</li>
            <li>Feels light on my skin</li>
            <li>and I got the fragrance free one and there is no scent.</li>
            <li>Soft and bright skin</li>
            <li>Not such a great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is creamy, smells good, &amp; it doesnt make my sensitive skin breakout.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone looking for a facial moisturizer that works as good or better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absolutely helped even out my skin tone and from someone who&#x27;s used a million different face moisturizers, this has boded as the best for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>here we are, I tried the Olay today and so far so good.</li>
            <li>When Olay first came out with this line I started using it!!</li>
            <li>, is amazing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My best friend recommended this product and she has really oily skin, I have dry skin</li>
            <li>Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System (twice a week for microdermabrasion, twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days, once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days)&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li>This olay daily moisturizer is very natural looking and perfect underneath make-up.</li>
            <li>I love Olay Total Effects because it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and provides great moisturization.</li>
            <li>Not sure what has combined to create the perfect storm this time.  </li>
            <li>It was originally listed as a product I could receive as often as I wanted it sent to me.</li>
            <li>Nourish the skin with rich moisturization&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I just looked back on some old photos and happened to notice that there is a huge difference in my skin, so very happy I started using this.</li>
            <li>My sister originally told me about this product.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used so many different products for her sunspots and loves this one the best especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I could immediate tell a difference when touching my face after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li>Creamy, light, true to being fragrance</li>
            <li>(at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li>Once the product came in, I was so excited to begin using it.  </li>
            <li>Decent UV protection, light moisture that absorbs pretty quickly and creates a good surface for makeup or powder, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my combination skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a busy mother of 4 to feel like I am taking proper care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, absorbs quickly and well, does not have overpowering scent and even comes unscented.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry and oily skin.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many high and low end and am very satisfied with this purchase :).</li>
            <li>It really make my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not any better than other products that I have used.</li>
            <li>I still love Olay products though will try other ones next time, i guess oil free is best.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works better than most with the Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>The price on amazon is very competitive and on top of that I receive an additional discount by signing up to  </li>
            <li>love this soo much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I also have rosacea and it has no acids and actually has vitamins that are good for rosacea.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving it too.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up hope until my mother, who likes to shop at dollar stores, came to visit and bought me this at the full $20 price.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets dryer in cool weather and</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than anticipated so the automatic mailings should have more selections of timeframes.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I eat food so much, drink soda more than water</li>
            <li>The 15spf Olay Total Effects causes anything I apply to my face - makeup wise - to pill and flake.</li>
            <li>All Olay&#x27;s products are good - especially for the price as compared to others.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s absorbed quickly by skin, it evens out my skin tone and minimized my lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and blends right into my skin leaving it feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pump out the exact amount</li>
            <li>I really like oil of olay products, this one is light weight, doesnt cause skin irritation, doesnt have a strong smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Very light, helps with wrinkles (fine fine ones - not for deep ones), and has SPF!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>blocks the sun and moisturizes in one quick step.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I notice a change in my skin yet, but we will see how well the SPF works once I am able to spend more time outside now that it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; in Chicago anymore!</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Believe me I am super picky w products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I love products that a fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Being a loyal user of Olay, I give this purchase 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ole Henricksen&#x27;s \\&quot;truth revealed super creme SPF 15\\&quot;, which is $55 a jar.  </li>
            <li>It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out.  </li>
            <li>Drys very fast!</li>
            <li>THE ONE FROM THE USA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONES FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES</li>
            <li>It is a reliable product and really not very expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for normal to oily skin and has SPF 15 in it :) but wash your hands before you touch your eyeliner brush it really stings if it gets in your eyes, a lot of moisturizers in the past haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great.  </li>
            <li>The regular version without sunscreen is still a pretty darned good lotion.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t remember exactly when I started or how I was introduced but ever since, I&#x27;ve been using it!  </li>
            <li>With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better!</li>
            <li>Plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles! :)</li>
            <li>which is why I can&#x27;t really attest to Olay&#x27;s claim to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go into the skin like it used to just sits on top in kind of a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>I saw some pretty significant results on my laugh lines and blotchy skin within a week or so.</li>
            <li>Felt great to put on, had a slight sunscreen smell at first, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Packaging is awesome too doesn&#x27;t leave a drop behind in the bottle</li>
            <li>I apply once every day, in the morning, and it provides me with soft and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>Nice product overall.</li>
            <li>In the end, it seems the most important thing to do for your skin is just wear a daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops and spreads so nicely that the 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li>container is sufficient and, actually, cost effective when you consider it contains an SPF 15 sunscreen too.</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It also helps my foundation look more natural looking because the moisturizer is so hydrating.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have minimal wrinkling and my skin feels good.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the SPF built in is better than using a separate heavier sunblock.</li>
            <li>Well worth it .</li>
            <li>I have been using Oil of Olay Total Effects fragrance free for many years.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it not only helps keep my skin feeling smoother, it isn&#x27;t greasy but feels nice going on and provides a touch of foundation as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily but fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling really soft healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It does smell like sunblock because of the spf, but the smell does go away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good product by Olay; I like their other products, but when I put it on, it made my face break out in hives.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier feeling on my skin, not lightweight like the original, my eyes burn and tear after applying it (</li>
            <li>Good product but the price is not as competitive as other sites.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for anyone over the age of 55 for the just right amount of moisture without grease.</li>
            <li>The price is right and would recommend it to everyone who loves Olay products</li>
            <li>Ordered it right away with the automatic refill option.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>But, being the frugal person I am, I decided to pry open the bottle top, I removed all the pieces, and I discovered the bottle was full of lotion.</li>
            <li>Instead I would highly recommend Garnier Ultra-Lift, it&#x27;s light, and does not irritate or make you skin break out.</li>
            <li>After many trials, this was the best moisturizer I could find that properly moisturized my skin (protecting it against Canada&#x27;s cold) and didn&#x27;t cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>May skin feels baby soft after I put this on it and it does not burn and itch, in the dry weather it brings great relief.  </li>
            <li>No scent, which is good, since my nose is delicate to strong smells.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft and with a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>After five years of living 10 degrees north of the equator, my skin has held up remarkably well, with few signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>so I have to wait and kill time before I do my makeup which is a bummer when I am in a hurry, but it probably just means it is more moisturizing of a cream in general.</li>
            <li>It was a nice treat, but the regular Oil of Olay daily moisturizer (about $8) does just as well.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best moisturizer I have used in a long time, plus it has other advantages.</li>
            <li>I really like the Olay moisturizers, they work very well for the fine lines and is not greasy like some.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>It is really light and not greasy at all, and the SPF 15 was what sealed the deal for me since I live in California.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  </li>
            <li>I loved Complete and finished the entire jar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products.</li>
            <li>It soaks in into skin very fast and while leaving a silky feel, it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>My favorite twice daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t break out when I first started using this product.</li>
            <li>I would like to see a higher SPF content though.</li>
            <li>I put it on Sunday evening and by Monday evening my face felt hot</li>
            <li>I think my skin looks only better, though.  </li>
            <li>I tried powder on top of the moisturizer to reduce the shiny look, only to find that if I touched my face (at all!)</li>
            <li>My skin has a much more youthful look after using Total Effects.</li>
            <li>I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li>My makeup still blends well over it and it seems to hold up pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than the majority of drugstore daily moisturizers in price and quality.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite moisturizer - I use this daily throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I have been usingOlay Total Effects for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is better for moisturizing my face especially in the northeast winter time.</li>
            <li>When Olay Total Effects was launched, I was intrigued because of the many benefits it claims that it gives.</li>
            <li>I was recently in Tanzania for research and mistakenly thought I would be able to find a bottle somewhere along the way.  </li>
            <li>I only use it at night, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>My skin thanked me after the first application.  </li>
            <li>I almost never need more than a tiny amount the size of a pencil eraser to cover my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>so, u have to try first to find out if it will work for u or not.</li>
            <li>I use Olay total effects for more than 5 years, this was the first time that I buy this product from amazon,</li>
            <li>Some aging spots have significantly faded and the moisturizing effect is even better than the other product from a salon.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a suspicious package and thought about reporting it to the post office.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries to a non-sticky soft texture.</li>
            <li>and I love how it improves my skin condition with constant use and</li>
            <li>Cannot go anywhere without first applying and when going on vacation it can be applied under the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>okay product, only used a couple of weeks, no visible change yet!</li>
            <li>It was more liquidy and smelled different.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been on Clinique Dramatically Diff Moisturizer for about 5 years now and at first i thought i&#x27;ll be using it for the rest of my ife..</li>
            <li>well the obvious, but mostly because I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C (in the form of Ascorbic Acid) and/or Antioxidants.</li>
            <li>Glad I found the moisturizer with SPF 15 since I&#x27;m outside with my horse a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well.</li>
            <li>In this case, the night is worth it, day not so much.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li>I also know that toward the end of this, there&#x27;s going to be some left in the bottom that I&#x27;ll never be able to access or use.  </li>
            <li>My younger sister has more wrinkles than I do.  </li>
            <li>Instead of spending a lot more for the higher name brands my wife uses this and feels it works well for her; especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am Lesley McKee, not Charles.  </li>
            <li>The sun gets scorching hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while, this is not my first purchase, &amp; I like it.</li>
            <li>Offers sun protection, stellar ingredients and the added bonus of fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I wish i could rate this higher.  </li>
            <li>First time online &amp; w SPF.  </li>
            <li>Love product, although it&#x27;s the only non-Vegan item I use, wish Olay would change that!</li>
            <li>threw it away after first use would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>First day I used it</li>
            <li>It is not oily at all, has spf in it, and is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to pry open the top and use a Q-tip to get to the rest of the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am only 27 and don&#x27;t have many problem areas, but my thoughts are I should start before there are problem areas</li>
            <li>I waited until I used this product for a few months before writing a review, to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>It is effective, but certainly not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been one week, so maybe I&#x27;ll notice some amazing effect, but so far, I&#x27;m unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, Olay has helped me completely turn my skin around.  :)</li>
            <li>Now note, my skin was never sensitive and I was able to use any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Friends which have not seen me a long time complement me on my more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>and it will work wonders pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine</li>
            <li>After many years of not caring the sun was starting to make me look older than my age.</li>
            <li>update: Still using this product and still highly recommend it, but sometimes switch it up with the Regenerist (comes in a similar container but squirts out the top) which I can now also recommend.  </li>
            <li>leaves skin smooth for the whole day and prevents advanced premature aging due to the sun.</li>
            <li>Obviously I&#x27;m aware the actual seller didn&#x27;t personally deliver it, but maybe they should be more involved/conscientious of how their packing and shipping services handle their products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lotions before that feel great at first, but then leave my skin feeling tight minutes later.</li>
            <li>I generally put on a light coat after showering and then mix the moisturizer with my foundation when getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>the dry areas around my eyes seem better.</li>
            <li>I have combination (most of the time dry) skin, and</li>
            <li>So easy to use, especially the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tried the maybelline tinted BB cream, didn&#x27;t like it, felt like my skin was more dry wearing it or something.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a longterm review of the product, however I&#x27;m almost certain</li>
            <li>While I certainly can&#x27;t fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day, I cannot in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions.  </li>
            <li>Any husband, of long standing, who expresses an opinion on an anti-aging products effectiveness better make sure he weighs his words carefully.  </li>
            <li>After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>Previously I used Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer SPF 30 for sensitive skin, which is a great product, but I have fine lines on my forehead now and wanted to try to combat them.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine because I don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s mainly the reason for the review!</li>
            <li>My friend also pointed out something similar the other day, so feeling pretty good about it.</li>
            <li>my first application, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the original beauty fluid, that it in fact felt thicker, almost like the consistency of your basic sunscreen (it even smells like one).  </li>
            <li>The more I try to rub it in, the more it clumps up into little white bits all over my face.</li>
            <li>I had no lines near my eyes, my skin feels soft and comfortable unless I abuse it.  </li>
            <li>Just had several people my age (near 40 now, when did that happen?), and the lady doing my facial tell me that I have wonderful, young looking skin and again guess that I&#x27;m years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>I expected more, and won&#x27;t be spending so much again.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and really noticed a difference when I have stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the lotion I use every day now for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m in my 30s and living in the tropics, and I&#x27;m still happy with it; the SPF factor is essential for my daily routine, as I prefer to use the heavier sunblocks only when I&#x27;m out in the sun for prolonged periods as it really clogs my pores.  </li>
            <li>It really works well in her skin.</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>I love olay products, but this moisturizer was heavy and made my face shiny and greasy feeling--very similar to how most sunscreens feel on your face.  </li>
            <li>as a gentle sunscreen for the face, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oil of Olay products for years now and decided to try the Olay Total Effects - Advanced anti-aging skin care.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t sell Olay in the Philippines then and you could only find this product at duty free shops.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have that much lines on my face YET,</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very convenient.</li>
            <li>I found the subscription option at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it for at least $5 cheaper than anywhere I can find it locally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>I can fool you in the spring time when it can be really cloudy but can get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>So i really dont trust this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading this review</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>As for the anti-aging claims - who really knows if any lotion is working?</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps my face moisturized, so the lines probably don&#x27;t show as much and the UV element probably helps too.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free</li>
            <li>Olay Total Effect&#x27;s facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>However, it is moisturizing my skin very well and is helping my scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>i can really see the difference in my face</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li>Received in very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this in the winters and it moisturized my skin very well.</li>
            <li>so you have to really rub this in</li>
            <li>As aforementioned, I purchased this primarily because it is a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C  (Ascorbic Acid).</li>
            <li>and it really does work</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I always use Total Effects fragrance free with SPF.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is very competitive so that&#x27;s why I get it through subscription.</li>
            <li>really like it for my face</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school.  </li>
            <li>I never know how much I&#x27;m going to get per pump</li>
            <li>I really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face.  </li>
            <li>It makes my whole face all one shade and controls sagging and just makes me look radiant.  </li>
            <li>I in turn gave it to my mother who really likes it, though.  </li>
            <li>would much prefer to go to a retail shop to purchase this item, but none in my area carry the tinted variety.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t smell or feel like sunscreen, but both of my concerns were real - this product looks, smells and feels like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d try it again because i really like the product when it works and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The SPF works very well</li>
            <li>I found this moisturizer very creamy but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>BUT... After using it for a while my skin has become very oily...</li>
            <li>I even bought some oil control powder to try to control it, but that doesn&#x27;t work very well...</li>
            <li>I really like serums, so</li>
            <li>and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using my face is really smooth and clear, I am 39 years old</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay, the original Oil of Olay, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing gel.  </li>
            <li>So, my daily makeup routine is to put on my original Olay SPF-15 moisturing cream, and then put this 7 in 1 product on,</li>
            <li>Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application.</li>
            <li>i realized that my skin needed special treatment to not only control signs of aging, but also not exacerbate my acne.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I am very new to a skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>This lotion goes on very smoothly, though does have a slight scent to it of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Honestly the price-point for what you get is comparable to other similar products promising to cater to aging skin issues.</li>
            <li>SLIGHTLY more even skin (less age spots appearance).  </li>
            <li>It made my skin look refreshed and the wrinkles seemed less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I think it helped with the fine lines (I am 35 years old, normal to mixed skin).</li>
            <li>today&#x27;s products are all too heavily scented, and I pay good money for actual perfume already.    </li>
            <li>I am mainly using it to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I found Olay&#x27;s Total Effects.</li>
            <li>Went back to this and got that healthy glow back.</li>
            <li>As I grew older</li>
            <li>convenient and quick way to get necessary household items</li>
            <li>I particularly like the unscented version with UV protection.  </li>
            <li>Olay Total Effects with SPF 15 used to be my and my daughter&#x27;s favorite daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but my skin remained dry, hot, itchy, flaky, and I was seeing laugh lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would rate it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream at night and would highly recommend you use the two products together.  </li>
            <li>I did not mean to get the one with the SPF sunscreen as I have ordered the one without it for years.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my favorite daytime facial moisturizer that&#x27;s available at the drugstore at a reasonable price (although the local warehouse had it at half the price for</li>
            <li>I use clean and clear morning burst morning and night with the proactive face cleansing brush followed by olay 7 in 1 total effects moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the subtle fragrance and the smooth creaminess of this product.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, smooth and honestly, apart from a few soft lines on my forehead, I have absolutely no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to really speak for any miraculous anti-aging properties, but I have noticed my face seems well-hydrated and</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling young for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smooth, isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and doesn&#x27;t burn/sting as some SPF moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>so, I will give it a few more try</li>
            <li>Nothing about this formula stands out enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li>So i really thank  olay total effects so much!</li>
            <li>Maybe it has crazy good ingredients or is good for your skin, but I will never come to enjoy putting thick, greasy feeling, white sunscreen on my face or body.</li>
            <li>Also as you use it do some facial exercises, and smile.</li>
            <li>I love this everyday face/neck cream.</li>
            <li>My mom has been using Olay for as long as I can remember, which is why I&#x27;m very familiar with its beauty fluid&#x27;s packaging and the scent.</li>
            <li>In fact it kept my skin soft and supple enough for the blemishes to heal quickly.      </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using their original beauty fluid since I was 16) and how gentle it&#x27;s been on my skin, I decided to see what they had to offer and came across the Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>I started using this when I was pregnant and noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t responding well to my normal foundation and was extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      </li>
            <li>I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer, they saw results in two weeks, this that and the other.  </li>
            <li>I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>Olay is producing a new formula.</li>
            <li>the event that Olay his producing a new formula, Amazon needs to update the photos of the product on this page.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the day, night, and new feather-weight day, fragrance-free versions of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good SPF that included anti-aging with SPF which is, oddly enough, rather hard to find in a drugstore brand that&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li>If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>i truly enjoy using product and am switching to such and was a former Avon Rep .</li>
            <li>I will be more careful next time!</li>
            <li>I am now in my late twenties and believe I owe my good skin to Olay Total Effects.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it since long but purchased first time from Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>shall let this product review serve as a cautionary tale to people with sensitive skin that the Olay Total Effects line may not be the right choice for them.  </li>
            <li>I shall let this product review serve as a cautionary tale to people with sensitive skin that the Olay Total Effects line may not be the right choice for them.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this product has made my skin very soft after once-twice daily use, I have not broken out from it, and would buy again!</li>
            <li>I wish there was a higher SPF for this product (it&#x27;s only SPF 15)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the results!  </li>
            <li>Been using Oil of Olay since my early twenties and am 71 now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic.</li>
            <li>but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter!</li>
            <li>It took me 6 more months after switching back to erase those other wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I live in northern New England, and have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I had heard such good reviews about this product I assumed it was something else that was making my face break out, so I used it a few more times and each time the hives got worse.</li>
            <li>I do not normally have sensitive skin, but I felt a mild burn after using it.  </li>
            <li>My first application was last night after my shower and I woke up this morning,my face still feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>They were each only  one fourth full.  </li>
            <li>After the first application, it did seem to make a positive difference but a couple of days later, my skin turned red and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t broken out or found myself to be any more oily than normal (and I have very oily skin).</li>
            <li>:) The only thing I do not like about this product is that I typically wash my face, apply moisturizer, put on my makeup, and head off to work in the morning.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not wearing a full load of makeup, i.e. foundation, I usually follow it up with a few brushstrokes of Benefit&#x27;s face powder such as Dandelion or Georgia for a quick and easy out-the-door look.  </li>
            <li>I am a redhead with very sensitive skin, and most moisturizers either look really greasy and turn my face red with irritation, or just absorb and leave my skin dry with no real improvement.</li>
            <li>I do get a little oily with it in the T-zone throughout the day if I don&#x27;t apply it sparingly there, but it does keep my skin smooth and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream)</li>
            <li>I love being in my late twenties and sporting a twelve year old like acne breakout.</li>
            <li>47 years old here.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so far.</li>
            <li>However, I still do use this as a middle of the day moisturezer when needed, and it still works very well.</li>
            <li>So far no changes to my forehead.</li>
            <li>Since the time has come for my 32-year-old skin to start receiving some boost to retain its young looks, I thought this product would help.</li>
            <li>All aspects of the purchase were professionally handled with emphasis on custumer relations.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day and it keeps my face moisturized and soft without feeling greasy or making my face break out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this</li>
            <li>My skin now feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>So, I recommend it but not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and appreciate that this lotion does not have a greasy feel or make break out.</li>
            <li>I started using Olay when my mom went on a trip to Canada and brought home a bottle of Olay Complete for me.</li>
            <li>I love Olay Total Effects and have been using the regular Total Effects daily moisturizer for years.  </li>
            <li>Antiaging UV Mosistrizer softens the skin and firms up the skin of a 79 year old.</li>
            <li>But I am quite sensitive to makeup</li>
            <li>Because my face is extremely soft and clear ever since using this product.  </li>
            <li>So far (3 days use) it has not no adverse reaction on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old....</li>
            <li>Before using this I did not think my skin was that sensitive because I never broke out into hives before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem using either product near my eyes.</li>
            <li>After shielding my face from the sun and washing my face everyday with a light exfoliating  </li>
            <li>Was surprised to see the result of this the minute I applied.</li>
            <li>have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But then realized it was the cream that I ordered nearly a month ago.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and the sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old.</li>
            <li>Not heavily perfumed, for which I am thankful.  </li>
            <li>The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed fewer wrinkles, but have not used it longer than a week so far.</li>
            <li>I have always had a young face</li>
            <li>Her words, &amp;#34;It isn&#x27;t too much moisture, and it absorbs quickly enough for my makeup application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Always leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but never greasy.</li>
            <li>...if your skin is sensitive; this is not the sunscreened-lotion for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years young but have passed for, between 48 and 52, my daughter is 47.  </li>
            <li>It helps my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>This package arrived early, and was well protected inside the box.  </li>
            <li>Also not for sensitive skin caused redness.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t think that this product would effect it since everyone said how \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; Olay products are.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, or you think you might have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>: if I magically appear 10 years younger in a few weeks I&#x27;ll edit this review - don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li>Seemed a little thick at first, but now I love the creamy feeling!</li>
            <li>I say I think because currently I am not really experiencing much of a difference yet, but it is still early in my use of it and it is starting out better than my other facial cream experiments have been thus far.</li>
            <li>Subtle \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; of the skin for a more youthful appearance&lt;</li>
            <li>for mild but noticeable smoother skin results, and slightly plumped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular moisturizer in Olay&#x27;s vast line of products is purported to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m nearly 31 now, I&#x27;ve begun to notice my skin looking aged, with fine lines and age spots taking center stage.</li>
            <li>They are all pretty much tiny little bottles that cost a pretty penny.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free products are less likely to irritate the skin than perfumed</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, and I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly, leaves no greasiness afterward, and prevents my face from feeling tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with larger than normal pores.</li>
            <li>but it took couple weeks for my skin to return back to normal.</li>
            <li>Yes, some of it is genetic, but I&#x27;ve temporarily switched to other products and within 4 weeks saw my skin looking less healthy.  </li>
            <li>Although there were many other Olay products available in the area I was unable to find this one.  </li>
            <li>I double checked the bottle to see if it was a new formula or something.</li>
            <li>I just opened my new box of Olay Total Effects--it DOES NOT contain sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the local RiteAid about a month ago because a young teenager told me that I look like their Grandma(I am 40 years old).  </li>
            <li>People consistently guess my age to be 5-8 years younger than I am even though I have grey hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed with choosing this product, I trusted a well known brand and a more expensive price.</li>
            <li>I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  </li>
            <li>so would appreciate it if the packaging was a little more obvious, but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li>This is the first Olay product I&#x27;ve tried and I plan to keep using it and also try other Olay products.  </li>
            <li>If I put it on right after a shower, it still takes half an hour for the greasy appearance that I get with sunscreen to go away.  </li>
            <li>am a senior citizen, 77 years old, and my skin is thin, sensitive, and bruises easy.  </li>
            <li>and you didn&#x27;t have to use much - I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>great product‚Ä¶ unless you get a bad batch.</li>
            <li>I generally beleive in Olay products.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and looking dewy.</li>
            <li>Im surprised that it actually minimized my pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing my personal history and the fact that I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(Olay Complete UV Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 15) and did not have a reaction</li>
            <li>(Olay Complete UV Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 15) and did not have a reaction</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t as smooth and clear as usual and the affects of the sun on my face without the daily facial sunscreen was undeniably noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE NO REGRETS</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd purchase but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any anti-aging results.</li>
            <li>No need to apply separate serums with this lotion, especially on your busy days.</li>
            <li>but apparently there is always room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use this as my a.m. moisturizer and then apply Bare Minerals powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>the product is not too thick nor too light.</li>
            <li>Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts!</li>
            <li>I have used this amazing moisturizer for years and was excited to find it at such a reduced price but was disappointed when told that I would not be receiving it at the same price on an ongoing basis.  </li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.speculated whether this rash could possibly be due to the combination of sunscreen agents in the product (4% octisalate, 2% avobenzone, 1% ensulizole, 1% octocrylene, all of which can cause rashes in some people).  </li>
            <li>This winter has been especially brisk, so my skin was still dry no matter how much product I put on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Also I developed a dry patch of skin near my chin.</li>
            <li>Lately, I have noticed more blemishes popping upand my skin looks dry and lifeliess.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear regular Oil of Olay stuff; makes me have allergic break-outs like a sun-of-a-gun, but Total Effects is worth a try if you&#x27;ve had problems with other lines.</li>
            <li>so is this saying much for other Co.</li>
            <li>When I used other face creams they would make my face super greasy or not enough and my skin tended to be dry.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have fair/dry skin that I usually classify as sensitive and live in a dry hot climate.</li>
            <li>I live in the high mountain deserts and this product gives your face a break from the harsh elements here.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and this product made my skin look really oily about half way through the day.</li>
            <li>This comment hit me pretty hard as I usually do not wear any makeup, but ever since I was a teenager I have worn the Oil of Olay Moisturizing SPF-15 Cream.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not very much in this container and unless you&#x27;re up to smooshing your face, it does not go very far.  </li>
            <li>I like how it feels (lightweight) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a general moisturizer to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive moisturizers, and I still keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its the classic Olay.</li>
            <li>My skin was red and so sensitive, I could not even use my regular cleanser or a Cortisone cream, the only thing that would not hurt when using was a local organic soap and Nivea cream.</li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s high price (compared to other brands)</li>
            <li>really like this day lotion with sunscreen, though I wish it had just a bit less shine to it for combo skin.  </li>
            <li>the ones i&#x27;ve previously ordered worked really well.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s definitely the moisturizer and not dry skin)</li>
            <li>my face (mostly temple areas, forhead, chin, apple of cheeks, tip of nose and neck) had swollen hovey area, is tight, extremely hot to the touch, and overall uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is not too heavy and it absorbs really well leaving my skin feeling soft and silky and keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li>Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning.</li>
            <li>Every moisturizer I have tried soaks right in and my skin is back to feeling tight and dry within hours.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin though I notice after applying my skin gets a slight-greasy sheen to it, which would normally be a deal breaker, but it goes away once the product fully sinks in, usually a half hour.  </li>
            <li>I switched back to my other brand of moisturizer and my skin went back to normal.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 bottles for a great price.</li>
            <li> People comment on how my skin has a glow--it has helped greatly the reddness on my noses/ckeeks.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin or hands greasy, which is great for me, as I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Great products at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>

            <li> This is my go to Oil of Olay lotion - and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  Amazingly, this product lasted me 10 months!  </li>
            <li> This product was amazing until makers changed it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look real healthy and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this, I&#x27;ve really liked it!</li>
            <li> For most days though, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturier!</li>
            <li> Pleasant moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very good item, cheap in my opinion and works wonders!</li>
            <li> Then I began shopping around for a good anti-aging moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be fair to give this item one star.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of some of the good reviews</li>
            <li> The package arrive in 3 business days and in good condition, however the product expiration date is 8/2015 just 3 months from now.</li>
            <li> One of the best product available in market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> Good results for the money.</li>
            <li> People tell me I hold my looks good</li>
            <li> I always loved Olay products..</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now with good results.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> Feels good, not greasy, protects my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good one with SPF for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cc cream and night cream from olay, and they were both good.</li>
            <li> It is effective, odorless and works great on my face.</li>
            <li> It might be good to use during summer time.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were as good for me in the summer</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference (a good one) after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> It smells so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Olay</li>
            <li> They are a good value compared to the department store brands.  </li>
            <li> she loved it.....</li>
            <li> Good for those of us over 35.</li>
            <li> , I purchased at Costco - loved it, it was lightweight, and I did not break out, and I went on to use it for years.  </li>
            <li> protects skin, smells good.</li>
            <li> olay always provides good products with good prices.</li>
            <li> This is a good line and product.  </li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, silky and rich but doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> (I am very fair skinned and burn easily) -- it has prevented a lot of sun damage.</li>
            <li> This one is exceptional..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s a really great product, love the SPF in it also.</li>
            <li> spf makes it smell not so good and doesn&#x27;t go on as nice a the one without spf</li>
            <li> Love, love it!!</li>
            <li> I love rhis product!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the SPF that protects my face all day!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy over and over!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love this !</li>
            <li> I started noticing a change within the first week itself and I absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the SPF is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I love that it is unscented!</li>
            <li> Truly love this!</li>
            <li> You will love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed as it seemed to address all my needs.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> and I look forward to using it more!</li>
            <li> It is very light and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing if you use it as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the supposedly amazing benefits of this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I guess thats for effective sun protection.</li>
            <li> No acne and just really nice looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I even saw a nice improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about UV rays when I have this on as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Amazon for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Of course it won&#x27;t stop the aging process, but it does make your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> It smooths on nicely, keeps my face moisturized without being greasy, and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> when it dries it kind of wipes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to apply SPF and lotion</li>
            <li> Kept my skin feeling nice all day.</li>
            <li> spf versions do not play well with makeups foundations or tinted creams of any kind that I have found; causes pilling and flaking.</li>
            <li> I liked this product as it worked at the time, but it contains alcohol</li>
            <li> It was otherwise an excellent product with a nice texture, moisturized perfectly without being too heavy to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not anything outstanding.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin and want a nice glow throughout the day I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> It felt so good and makes me feel safe that it has SPF 15</li>
            <li> My skin looked nice than it ever has.</li>
            <li> It made me look orange kind of.</li>
            <li> First off, I love Oil of Olay products they are great!</li>
            <li> I loved it but the scent was way to strong.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my very sensitive, rosacea-prone, over 50 skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the SPF 15 also since I sunburn very easily.</li>
            <li> It smells very strongly like sun lotion.</li>
            <li> so I break out very easily.  </li>
            <li> I have never felt better! :)</li>
            <li> Olay is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best that I have used.</li>
            <li> This is great for me,doesn&#x27;t take forever to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> The most effective Vitamin C in cosmetic products is Asorbic Acid.</li>
            <li> It has effective amounts of niacinamide (a really potent cell communicating anti ager) and sunscreen, and no scent which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all women that are looking for a day moisturizer, I have tried all brands from Chanel, Lanc√¥me, Dior, ect, and I found that this product is the most effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and very quick!  </li>
            <li> Easy all in one !&lt;</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free, i am very allergic and it has worked awesome.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for the summers and temperatures where it&#x27;s just hot.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true . . .</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very smooth and gives me that \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> We are both very fair and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The description says it&#x27;s unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin--dry and oily but mostly oily--and this moisturizer worked well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but not with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I reccommend trying this product and leaving it on for 2-3 days before deeming it safe.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay brand and have been using Olay products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I will buy it any more.</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li> My wife love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that it is on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will probably change that to every 3 months since the product has impressed me and now know that I will be using it daily.</li>
            <li> Cream is light and effective - been using it for years</li>
            <li> I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash.</li>
            <li> but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> And Im so glad to have it on automatic delivery frim Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I love that it&#x27;s unscented, that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li> This is the cheapest I have ever been able to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li> What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of months now, and felt that my skin was looking better</li>
            <li> used for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> but I like this moisturizer so much better.      </li>
            <li> I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After i bought this found better price at costco..</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li> Been using Olay for many years.</li>
            <li> When I abuse it, this lotion makes it feel better.  </li>
            <li> the Regenerist may be slightly better forcoloration issues, but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years I love the way it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li> I make sure that I exfoliate before use and voila - perfectly smooth and dewy skin!</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin feels and how my makeup goes on over this.  </li>
            <li> but I do see it making my skin look more youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> either of us have ever been able to find that&#x27;s worked, ever.</li>
            <li> But most of the creams promise that effect and none hold it.</li>
            <li> I kept using thinking my skin would get used to it, used most of the bottle with no change.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work okay as sunscreen, but it causes breakouts (acne) for me.</li>
            <li> The price when on sale is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is one of my top two favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love that it also has SPF 15.</li>
            <li> most AcneFree products)</li>
            <li> In addition, all of the paraben studies were conducted on people who already have cancer and not on people who are healthy.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love OTE.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> She being using for 2 years and love it</li>
            <li> this way I can carry it with me in my carry on :-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in unsented because I have alot of allergies.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> It just okay.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it unless I find something I like better</li>
            <li> I like that this product is on the safe to use list according to Environmental Working Group guide to safe cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros - night cream is better than the day and provides hydration without provoking acne/redness.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And my forehead lines seem better too.</li>
            <li> It can feel more like sunscreen than lotion.</li>
            <li> but this is one of my favorite products from them.</li>
            <li> I love my Olay products.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite moisturizer in years.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I&#x27;m going to try to go</li>
            <li> am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount</li>
            <li> , I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this.  </li>
            <li> Many days I have to blot it off.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 months, I got so many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena and Roc products are ok.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like Olay takes care of more than just wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I think I would not buy it again because I did not fell in love with it</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, wish it had more firming properties</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> This is more of a sunscreen than a lotion.</li>
            <li> It really is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that the SPF 15 was available once again!  </li>
            <li> So I need to get something more targeted to deal with that.</li>
            <li> so than if you use a sponge (better for your skin anyway).</li>
            <li> I love having the bonus UV protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I saw it recommended on another website as a best choice for facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used it for many months with no issues.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I did love it and</li>
            <li> Love purchasing Olay products with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> anything that purports to do what a serum does and more (antioxidants, brightening, even skin tone)  </li>
            <li> okay as face lotions go</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used Olay for more than 40 years and switched to Clinique.  </li>
            <li> And, it does smooth out the wrinkles.  !</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; great product I use it day &amp; night</li>
            <li> My wife uses it always, It is a good product and the price is right compared to stores</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great, and I do love the \\&quot;scent free\\&quot; because it kind of smells like sunscreen (SPF 15 in it) which I love because psychologically it makes me feel like I am on vacation</li>
            <li> Olay with sunscreen was amazing; no irritation...sunscreen...a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer for the price and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Used to give a nice cool feeling when applied now</li>
            <li> This product is a nice moisturizer but hasnt done anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li> As effective and much more cost effective than comparable high end department store items.</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to apply, with the special push-cap.</li>
            <li> while i haven&#x27;t noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a very good price for this product, so I see no need to run around trying to catch it on sale locally.  </li>
            <li> Over the years that cream has been great on my sensitive, ruddy, rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> As far as moisturizer goes, it was great, did the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sticking with just the fragrance free day and night version of this product, and I have to say while I love the one intended for night</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the presentation and texture of the cream.</li>
            <li> Neva too early to take precautions lol</li>
            <li> So far this is great</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone that wants a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad scent, it sort of reminds me of a high-end perfume, but very light.  </li>
            <li> One of the most economical of the Olay products in retail, purchase here provides even more cost savings.  </li>
            <li> The dispencer is easy to \\&quot;squeeze\\</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is easy to use with the pump.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> , I doubt the CDC would allow parabens to side that easily.</li>
            <li> I can moisturize my face and apply sunscreen in one easy step.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have not seen any evening, brightening features, but is a good decent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> i love Olay products and this one is perfect for aging skin/ use everyday on fine wrinkles and it WORKS...</li>
            <li> Smells good and does an okay job, but for the price, its not conquering any major skin issues.  </li>
            <li> consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply, it&#x27;s very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist UV and aging!</li>
            <li> and this works fine</li>
            <li> Minimize the appearance of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to its anti-aging qualities because I am 20, and do not have fine lines or wrinkles, though I have been using it as a &amp;#34;preventative medicine&amp;#34; of sorts.  </li>
            <li> I saw this 7 in 1 product and saw that it had a tint in it, and SPF, and took away fine lines, and it might help with my ruddy complexion, so I paid the $21 and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have a combination skin with some fine lines.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will be fine.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s totally fine for any age.</li>
            <li> The lotion helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and even pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m 40 and started noticing some fine lines/wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> My face went from being a mess to smooth, radiant and dare I say perfect.</li>
            <li> the SPF is a huge bonus since I don&#x27;t like wearing our sunscreen but one has to to prevent premature aging.</li>
            <li> Smooth, non-greasy, product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about, but otherwise I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Male user here, and it makes a great post-shave lotion on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance FREE -</li>
            <li> /&gt;6) Defense against free radicals</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this product because it is fragrance free</li>
            <li> it is a nice gentle sunscreen,</li>
            <li> I think this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall great investment.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for two years, it is comfortable lightweight and helps protect against sun damage.  </li>
            <li> My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect combination of moisturizer and SPF protection for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to be with my Olay moisturizer again once back home and won&#x27;t be found without it again!  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle-free.  </li>
            <li> I know I sound like a girl.</li>
            <li> Effective product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would put on a light coat over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light feeling and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I like the light consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> It gives skin a smooth glow.</li>
            <li> &quot; Given that these are anti-aging products, and I (and I think most women) use them around the eyes, it is a warning worth noting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my skin went from acne prone, blackheads, and spots to smooth radiant skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to apply SPF every day, even in the summer, and so I do.</li>
            <li> It does not give the silky smooth finish Olay cream is renound for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also meant to be fragrance free</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on great, isn&#x27;t greasy and has an SPF which we ladies should use daily.</li>
            <li> The pump is nice because it helps prevent pouring out too much at once.</li>
            <li> It blends in efforlessly and makes my face feel moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Almost a year later, I still use it and my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with lots of extra benefits - SPF 15.</li>
            <li> Feels light on my skin</li>
            <li> and I got the fragrance free one and there is no scent.</li>
            <li> Soft and bright skin</li>
            <li> Not such a great product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is creamy, smells good, &amp; it doesnt make my sensitive skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone looking for a facial moisturizer that works as good or better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absolutely helped even out my skin tone and from someone who&#x27;s used a million different face moisturizers, this has boded as the best for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> here we are, I tried the Olay today and so far so good.</li>
            <li> When Olay first came out with this line I started using it!!</li>
            <li> , is amazing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My best friend recommended this product and she has really oily skin, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System (twice a week for microdermabrasion, twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days, once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days)&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> This olay daily moisturizer is very natural looking and perfect underneath make-up.</li>
            <li> I love Olay Total Effects because it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and provides great moisturization.</li>
            <li> Not sure what has combined to create the perfect storm this time.  </li>
            <li> It was originally listed as a product I could receive as often as I wanted it sent to me.</li>
            <li> Nourish the skin with rich moisturization&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I just looked back on some old photos and happened to notice that there is a huge difference in my skin, so very happy I started using this.</li>
            <li> My sister originally told me about this product.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used so many different products for her sunspots and loves this one the best especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I could immediate tell a difference when touching my face after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li> Creamy, light, true to being fragrance</li>
            <li> (at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> Once the product came in, I was so excited to begin using it.  </li>
            <li> Decent UV protection, light moisture that absorbs pretty quickly and creates a good surface for makeup or powder, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my combination skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a busy mother of 4 to feel like I am taking proper care of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, absorbs quickly and well, does not have overpowering scent and even comes unscented.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry and oily skin.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many high and low end and am very satisfied with this purchase :).</li>
            <li> It really make my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not any better than other products that I have used.</li>
            <li> I still love Olay products though will try other ones next time, i guess oil free is best.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works better than most with the Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> The price on amazon is very competitive and on top of that I receive an additional discount by signing up to  </li>
            <li> love this soo much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I also have rosacea and it has no acids and actually has vitamins that are good for rosacea.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving it too.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up hope until my mother, who likes to shop at dollar stores, came to visit and bought me this at the full $20 price.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets dryer in cool weather and</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than anticipated so the automatic mailings should have more selections of timeframes.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I eat food so much, drink soda more than water</li>
            <li> The 15spf Olay Total Effects causes anything I apply to my face - makeup wise - to pill and flake.</li>
            <li> All Olay&#x27;s products are good - especially for the price as compared to others.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s absorbed quickly by skin, it evens out my skin tone and minimized my lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and blends right into my skin leaving it feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pump out the exact amount</li>
            <li> I really like oil of olay products, this one is light weight, doesnt cause skin irritation, doesnt have a strong smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Very light, helps with wrinkles (fine fine ones - not for deep ones), and has SPF!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> blocks the sun and moisturizes in one quick step.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I notice a change in my skin yet, but we will see how well the SPF works once I am able to spend more time outside now that it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; in Chicago anymore!</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Believe me I am super picky w products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I love products that a fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Being a loyal user of Olay, I give this purchase 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ole Henricksen&#x27;s \\&quot;truth revealed super creme SPF 15\\&quot;, which is $55 a jar.  </li>
            <li> It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out.  </li>
            <li> Drys very fast!</li>
            <li> THE ONE FROM THE USA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONES FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES</li>
            <li> It is a reliable product and really not very expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for normal to oily skin and has SPF 15 in it :) but wash your hands before you touch your eyeliner brush it really stings if it gets in your eyes, a lot of moisturizers in the past haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great.  </li>
            <li> The regular version without sunscreen is still a pretty darned good lotion.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember exactly when I started or how I was introduced but ever since, I&#x27;ve been using it!  </li>
            <li> With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better!</li>
            <li> Plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles! :)</li>
            <li> which is why I can&#x27;t really attest to Olay&#x27;s claim to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go into the skin like it used to just sits on top in kind of a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I saw some pretty significant results on my laugh lines and blotchy skin within a week or so.</li>
            <li> Felt great to put on, had a slight sunscreen smell at first, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Packaging is awesome too doesn&#x27;t leave a drop behind in the bottle</li>
            <li> I apply once every day, in the morning, and it provides me with soft and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> In the end, it seems the most important thing to do for your skin is just wear a daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops and spreads so nicely that the 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> container is sufficient and, actually, cost effective when you consider it contains an SPF 15 sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> makes my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It also helps my foundation look more natural looking because the moisturizer is so hydrating.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have minimal wrinkling and my skin feels good.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t laugh.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the SPF built in is better than using a separate heavier sunblock.</li>
            <li> Well worth it .</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay Total Effects fragrance free for many years.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it not only helps keep my skin feeling smoother, it isn&#x27;t greasy but feels nice going on and provides a touch of foundation as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily but fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really soft healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It does smell like sunblock because of the spf, but the smell does go away pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product by Olay; I like their other products, but when I put it on, it made my face break out in hives.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier feeling on my skin, not lightweight like the original, my eyes burn and tear after applying it (</li>
            <li> Good product but the price is not as competitive as other sites.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone over the age of 55 for the just right amount of moisture without grease.</li>
            <li> The price is right and would recommend it to everyone who loves Olay products</li>
            <li> Ordered it right away with the automatic refill option.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> But, being the frugal person I am, I decided to pry open the bottle top, I removed all the pieces, and I discovered the bottle was full of lotion.</li>
            <li> Instead I would highly recommend Garnier Ultra-Lift, it&#x27;s light, and does not irritate or make you skin break out.</li>
            <li> After many trials, this was the best moisturizer I could find that properly moisturized my skin (protecting it against Canada&#x27;s cold) and didn&#x27;t cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> May skin feels baby soft after I put this on it and it does not burn and itch, in the dry weather it brings great relief.  </li>
            <li> No scent, which is good, since my nose is delicate to strong smells.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very soft and with a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li> After five years of living 10 degrees north of the equator, my skin has held up remarkably well, with few signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> so I have to wait and kill time before I do my makeup which is a bummer when I am in a hurry, but it probably just means it is more moisturizing of a cream in general.</li>
            <li> It was a nice treat, but the regular Oil of Olay daily moisturizer (about $8) does just as well.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer I have used in a long time, plus it has other advantages.</li>
            <li> I really like the Olay moisturizers, they work very well for the fine lines and is not greasy like some.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It is really light and not greasy at all, and the SPF 15 was what sealed the deal for me since I live in California.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  </li>
            <li> I loved Complete and finished the entire jar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products.</li>
            <li> It soaks in into skin very fast and while leaving a silky feel, it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> My favorite twice daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out when I first started using this product.</li>
            <li> I would like to see a higher SPF content though.</li>
            <li> I put it on Sunday evening and by Monday evening my face felt hot</li>
            <li> I think my skin looks only better, though.  </li>
            <li> I tried powder on top of the moisturizer to reduce the shiny look, only to find that if I touched my face (at all!)</li>
            <li> My skin has a much more youthful look after using Total Effects.</li>
            <li> I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li> My makeup still blends well over it and it seems to hold up pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than the majority of drugstore daily moisturizers in price and quality.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite moisturizer - I use this daily throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> I have been usingOlay Total Effects for many years now.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is better for moisturizing my face especially in the northeast winter time.</li>
            <li> When Olay Total Effects was launched, I was intrigued because of the many benefits it claims that it gives.</li>
            <li> I was recently in Tanzania for research and mistakenly thought I would be able to find a bottle somewhere along the way.  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My skin thanked me after the first application.  </li>
            <li> I almost never need more than a tiny amount the size of a pencil eraser to cover my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> so, u have to try first to find out if it will work for u or not.</li>
            <li> I use Olay total effects for more than 5 years, this was the first time that I buy this product from amazon,</li>
            <li> Some aging spots have significantly faded and the moisturizing effect is even better than the other product from a salon.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a suspicious package and thought about reporting it to the post office.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries to a non-sticky soft texture.</li>
            <li> and I love how it improves my skin condition with constant use and</li>
            <li> Cannot go anywhere without first applying and when going on vacation it can be applied under the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> okay product, only used a couple of weeks, no visible change yet!</li>
            <li> It was more liquidy and smelled different.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been on Clinique Dramatically Diff Moisturizer for about 5 years now and at first i thought i&#x27;ll be using it for the rest of my ife..</li>
            <li> well the obvious, but mostly because I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C (in the form of Ascorbic Acid) and/or Antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Glad I found the moisturizer with SPF 15 since I&#x27;m outside with my horse a lot.  </li>
            <li> I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well.</li>
            <li> In this case, the night is worth it, day not so much.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> I also know that toward the end of this, there&#x27;s going to be some left in the bottom that I&#x27;ll never be able to access or use.  </li>
            <li> My younger sister has more wrinkles than I do.  </li>
            <li> Instead of spending a lot more for the higher name brands my wife uses this and feels it works well for her; especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am Lesley McKee, not Charles.  </li>
            <li> The sun gets scorching hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while, this is not my first purchase, &amp; I like it.</li>
            <li> Offers sun protection, stellar ingredients and the added bonus of fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I wish i could rate this higher.  </li>
            <li> First time online &amp; w SPF.  </li>
            <li> Love product, although it&#x27;s the only non-Vegan item I use, wish Olay would change that!</li>
            <li> threw it away after first use would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> First day I used it</li>
            <li> It is not oily at all, has spf in it, and is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to pry open the top and use a Q-tip to get to the rest of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am only 27 and don&#x27;t have many problem areas, but my thoughts are I should start before there are problem areas</li>
            <li> I waited until I used this product for a few months before writing a review, to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li> It is effective, but certainly not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been one week, so maybe I&#x27;ll notice some amazing effect, but so far, I&#x27;m unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, Olay has helped me completely turn my skin around.  :)</li>
            <li> Now note, my skin was never sensitive and I was able to use any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Friends which have not seen me a long time complement me on my more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> and it will work wonders pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine</li>
            <li> After many years of not caring the sun was starting to make me look older than my age.</li>
            <li> update: Still using this product and still highly recommend it, but sometimes switch it up with the Regenerist (comes in a similar container but squirts out the top) which I can now also recommend.  </li>
            <li> leaves skin smooth for the whole day and prevents advanced premature aging due to the sun.</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m aware the actual seller didn&#x27;t personally deliver it, but maybe they should be more involved/conscientious of how their packing and shipping services handle their products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lotions before that feel great at first, but then leave my skin feeling tight minutes later.</li>
            <li> I generally put on a light coat after showering and then mix the moisturizer with my foundation when getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> the dry areas around my eyes seem better.</li>
            <li> I have combination (most of the time dry) skin, and</li>
            <li> So easy to use, especially the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tried the maybelline tinted BB cream, didn&#x27;t like it, felt like my skin was more dry wearing it or something.</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a longterm review of the product, however I&#x27;m almost certain</li>
            <li> While I certainly can&#x27;t fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day, I cannot in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions.  </li>
            <li> Any husband, of long standing, who expresses an opinion on an anti-aging products effectiveness better make sure he weighs his words carefully.  </li>
            <li> After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer SPF 30 for sensitive skin, which is a great product, but I have fine lines on my forehead now and wanted to try to combat them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine because I don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s mainly the reason for the review!</li>
            <li> My friend also pointed out something similar the other day, so feeling pretty good about it.</li>
            <li> my first application, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the original beauty fluid, that it in fact felt thicker, almost like the consistency of your basic sunscreen (it even smells like one).  </li>
            <li> The more I try to rub it in, the more it clumps up into little white bits all over my face.</li>
            <li> I had no lines near my eyes, my skin feels soft and comfortable unless I abuse it.  </li>
            <li> Just had several people my age (near 40 now, when did that happen?), and the lady doing my facial tell me that I have wonderful, young looking skin and again guess that I&#x27;m years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> I expected more, and won&#x27;t be spending so much again.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and really noticed a difference when I have stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the lotion I use every day now for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m in my 30s and living in the tropics, and I&#x27;m still happy with it; the SPF factor is essential for my daily routine, as I prefer to use the heavier sunblocks only when I&#x27;m out in the sun for prolonged periods as it really clogs my pores.  </li>
            <li> It really works well in her skin.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I love olay products, but this moisturizer was heavy and made my face shiny and greasy feeling--very similar to how most sunscreens feel on your face.  </li>
            <li> as a gentle sunscreen for the face, I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products for years now and decided to try the Olay Total Effects - Advanced anti-aging skin care.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t sell Olay in the Philippines then and you could only find this product at duty free shops.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that much lines on my face YET,</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very convenient.</li>
            <li> I found the subscription option at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it for at least $5 cheaper than anywhere I can find it locally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> I can fool you in the spring time when it can be really cloudy but can get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> So i really dont trust this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading this review</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> As for the anti-aging claims - who really knows if any lotion is working?</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my face moisturized, so the lines probably don&#x27;t show as much and the UV element probably helps too.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effect&#x27;s facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> However, it is moisturizing my skin very well and is helping my scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> i can really see the difference in my face</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> Received in very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have very oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this in the winters and it moisturized my skin very well.</li>
            <li> so you have to really rub this in</li>
            <li> As aforementioned, I purchased this primarily because it is a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C  (Ascorbic Acid).</li>
            <li> and it really does work</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I always use Total Effects fragrance free with SPF.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is very competitive so that&#x27;s why I get it through subscription.</li>
            <li> really like it for my face</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school.  </li>
            <li> I never know how much I&#x27;m going to get per pump</li>
            <li> I really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face.  </li>
            <li> It makes my whole face all one shade and controls sagging and just makes me look radiant.  </li>
            <li> I in turn gave it to my mother who really likes it, though.  </li>
            <li> would much prefer to go to a retail shop to purchase this item, but none in my area carry the tinted variety.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t smell or feel like sunscreen, but both of my concerns were real - this product looks, smells and feels like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d try it again because i really like the product when it works and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The SPF works very well</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer very creamy but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> BUT... After using it for a while my skin has become very oily...</li>
            <li> I even bought some oil control powder to try to control it, but that doesn&#x27;t work very well...</li>
            <li> I really like serums, so</li>
            <li> and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using my face is really smooth and clear, I am 39 years old</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay, the original Oil of Olay, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing gel.  </li>
            <li> So, my daily makeup routine is to put on my original Olay SPF-15 moisturing cream, and then put this 7 in 1 product on,</li>
            <li> Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application.</li>
            <li> i realized that my skin needed special treatment to not only control signs of aging, but also not exacerbate my acne.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I am very new to a skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> This lotion goes on very smoothly, though does have a slight scent to it of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Honestly the price-point for what you get is comparable to other similar products promising to cater to aging skin issues.</li>
            <li> SLIGHTLY more even skin (less age spots appearance).  </li>
            <li> It made my skin look refreshed and the wrinkles seemed less prominent.  </li>
            <li> I think it helped with the fine lines (I am 35 years old, normal to mixed skin).</li>
            <li> today&#x27;s products are all too heavily scented, and I pay good money for actual perfume already.    </li>
            <li> I am mainly using it to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I found Olay&#x27;s Total Effects.</li>
            <li> Went back to this and got that healthy glow back.</li>
            <li> As I grew older</li>
            <li> convenient and quick way to get necessary household items</li>
            <li> I particularly like the unscented version with UV protection.  </li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects with SPF 15 used to be my and my daughter&#x27;s favorite daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but my skin remained dry, hot, itchy, flaky, and I was seeing laugh lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would rate it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream at night and would highly recommend you use the two products together.  </li>
            <li> I did not mean to get the one with the SPF sunscreen as I have ordered the one without it for years.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my favorite daytime facial moisturizer that&#x27;s available at the drugstore at a reasonable price (although the local warehouse had it at half the price for</li>
            <li> I use clean and clear morning burst morning and night with the proactive face cleansing brush followed by olay 7 in 1 total effects moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the subtle fragrance and the smooth creaminess of this product.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, smooth and honestly, apart from a few soft lines on my forehead, I have absolutely no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to really speak for any miraculous anti-aging properties, but I have noticed my face seems well-hydrated and</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling young for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smooth, isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and doesn&#x27;t burn/sting as some SPF moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> so, I will give it a few more try</li>
            <li> Nothing about this formula stands out enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> So i really thank  olay total effects so much!</li>
            <li> Maybe it has crazy good ingredients or is good for your skin, but I will never come to enjoy putting thick, greasy feeling, white sunscreen on my face or body.</li>
            <li> Also as you use it do some facial exercises, and smile.</li>
            <li> I love this everyday face/neck cream.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using Olay for as long as I can remember, which is why I&#x27;m very familiar with its beauty fluid&#x27;s packaging and the scent.</li>
            <li> In fact it kept my skin soft and supple enough for the blemishes to heal quickly.      </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using their original beauty fluid since I was 16) and how gentle it&#x27;s been on my skin, I decided to see what they had to offer and came across the Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15.  </li>
            <li> I started using this when I was pregnant and noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t responding well to my normal foundation and was extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      </li>
            <li> I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer, they saw results in two weeks, this that and the other.  </li>
            <li> I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> Olay is producing a new formula.</li>
            <li> the event that Olay his producing a new formula, Amazon needs to update the photos of the product on this page.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the day, night, and new feather-weight day, fragrance-free versions of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good SPF that included anti-aging with SPF which is, oddly enough, rather hard to find in a drugstore brand that&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> i truly enjoy using product and am switching to such and was a former Avon Rep .</li>
            <li> I will be more careful next time!</li>
            <li> I am now in my late twenties and believe I owe my good skin to Olay Total Effects.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since long but purchased first time from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li> shall let this product review serve as a cautionary tale to people with sensitive skin that the Olay Total Effects line may not be the right choice for them.  </li>
            <li> I shall let this product review serve as a cautionary tale to people with sensitive skin that the Olay Total Effects line may not be the right choice for them.  </li>
            <li> All in all, this product has made my skin very soft after once-twice daily use, I have not broken out from it, and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a higher SPF for this product (it&#x27;s only SPF 15)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the results!  </li>
            <li> Been using Oil of Olay since my early twenties and am 71 now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic.</li>
            <li> but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> It took me 6 more months after switching back to erase those other wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I live in northern New England, and have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I had heard such good reviews about this product I assumed it was something else that was making my face break out, so I used it a few more times and each time the hives got worse.</li>
            <li> I do not normally have sensitive skin, but I felt a mild burn after using it.  </li>
            <li> My first application was last night after my shower and I woke up this morning,my face still feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> They were each only  one fourth full.  </li>
            <li> After the first application, it did seem to make a positive difference but a couple of days later, my skin turned red and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out or found myself to be any more oily than normal (and I have very oily skin).</li>
            <li> :) The only thing I do not like about this product is that I typically wash my face, apply moisturizer, put on my makeup, and head off to work in the morning.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not wearing a full load of makeup, i.e. foundation, I usually follow it up with a few brushstrokes of Benefit&#x27;s face powder such as Dandelion or Georgia for a quick and easy out-the-door look.  </li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very sensitive skin, and most moisturizers either look really greasy and turn my face red with irritation, or just absorb and leave my skin dry with no real improvement.</li>
            <li> I do get a little oily with it in the T-zone throughout the day if I don&#x27;t apply it sparingly there, but it does keep my skin smooth and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li> I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream)</li>
            <li> I love being in my late twenties and sporting a twelve year old like acne breakout.</li>
            <li> 47 years old here.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so far.</li>
            <li> However, I still do use this as a middle of the day moisturezer when needed, and it still works very well.</li>
            <li> So far no changes to my forehead.</li>
            <li> Since the time has come for my 32-year-old skin to start receiving some boost to retain its young looks, I thought this product would help.</li>
            <li> All aspects of the purchase were professionally handled with emphasis on custumer relations.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day and it keeps my face moisturized and soft without feeling greasy or making my face break out.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this</li>
            <li> My skin now feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> So, I recommend it but not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and appreciate that this lotion does not have a greasy feel or make break out.</li>
            <li> I started using Olay when my mom went on a trip to Canada and brought home a bottle of Olay Complete for me.</li>
            <li> I love Olay Total Effects and have been using the regular Total Effects daily moisturizer for years.  </li>
            <li> Antiaging UV Mosistrizer softens the skin and firms up the skin of a 79 year old.</li>
            <li> But I am quite sensitive to makeup</li>
            <li> Because my face is extremely soft and clear ever since using this product.  </li>
            <li> So far (3 days use) it has not no adverse reaction on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old....</li>
            <li> Before using this I did not think my skin was that sensitive because I never broke out into hives before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem using either product near my eyes.</li>
            <li> After shielding my face from the sun and washing my face everyday with a light exfoliating  </li>
            <li> Was surprised to see the result of this the minute I applied.</li>
            <li> have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li> But then realized it was the cream that I ordered nearly a month ago.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and the sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old.</li>
            <li> Not heavily perfumed, for which I am thankful.  </li>
            <li> The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed fewer wrinkles, but have not used it longer than a week so far.</li>
            <li> I have always had a young face</li>
            <li> Her words, &amp;#34;It isn&#x27;t too much moisture, and it absorbs quickly enough for my makeup application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Always leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but never greasy.</li>
            <li> ...if your skin is sensitive; this is not the sunscreened-lotion for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years young but have passed for, between 48 and 52, my daughter is 47.  </li>
            <li> It helps my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> This package arrived early, and was well protected inside the box.  </li>
            <li> Also not for sensitive skin caused redness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t think that this product would effect it since everyone said how \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; Olay products are.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, or you think you might have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> : if I magically appear 10 years younger in a few weeks I&#x27;ll edit this review - don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick at first, but now I love the creamy feeling!</li>
            <li> I say I think because currently I am not really experiencing much of a difference yet, but it is still early in my use of it and it is starting out better than my other facial cream experiments have been thus far.</li>
            <li> Subtle \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; of the skin for a more youthful appearance&lt;</li>
            <li> for mild but noticeable smoother skin results, and slightly plumped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> particular moisturizer in Olay&#x27;s vast line of products is purported to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m nearly 31 now, I&#x27;ve begun to notice my skin looking aged, with fine lines and age spots taking center stage.</li>
            <li> They are all pretty much tiny little bottles that cost a pretty penny.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free products are less likely to irritate the skin than perfumed</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, and I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs quickly, leaves no greasiness afterward, and prevents my face from feeling tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with larger than normal pores.</li>
            <li> but it took couple weeks for my skin to return back to normal.</li>
            <li> Yes, some of it is genetic, but I&#x27;ve temporarily switched to other products and within 4 weeks saw my skin looking less healthy.  </li>
            <li> Although there were many other Olay products available in the area I was unable to find this one.  </li>
            <li> I double checked the bottle to see if it was a new formula or something.</li>
            <li> I just opened my new box of Olay Total Effects--it DOES NOT contain sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the local RiteAid about a month ago because a young teenager told me that I look like their Grandma(I am 40 years old).  </li>
            <li> People consistently guess my age to be 5-8 years younger than I am even though I have grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed with choosing this product, I trusted a well known brand and a more expensive price.</li>
            <li> I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so would appreciate it if the packaging was a little more obvious, but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> This is the first Olay product I&#x27;ve tried and I plan to keep using it and also try other Olay products.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on right after a shower, it still takes half an hour for the greasy appearance that I get with sunscreen to go away.  </li>
            <li> am a senior citizen, 77 years old, and my skin is thin, sensitive, and bruises easy.  </li>
            <li> and you didn&#x27;t have to use much - I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> great product‚Ä¶ unless you get a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I generally beleive in Olay products.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and looking dewy.</li>
            <li> Im surprised that it actually minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing my personal history and the fact that I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (Olay Complete UV Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 15) and did not have a reaction</li>
            <li> (Olay Complete UV Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 15) and did not have a reaction</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as smooth and clear as usual and the affects of the sun on my face without the daily facial sunscreen was undeniably noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE NO REGRETS</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any anti-aging results.</li>
            <li> No need to apply separate serums with this lotion, especially on your busy days.</li>
            <li> but apparently there is always room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use this as my a.m. moisturizer and then apply Bare Minerals powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> the product is not too thick nor too light.</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> I have used this amazing moisturizer for years and was excited to find it at such a reduced price but was disappointed when told that I would not be receiving it at the same price on an ongoing basis.  </li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.speculated whether this rash could possibly be due to the combination of sunscreen agents in the product (4% octisalate, 2% avobenzone, 1% ensulizole, 1% octocrylene, all of which can cause rashes in some people).  </li>
            <li> This winter has been especially brisk, so my skin was still dry no matter how much product I put on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Also I developed a dry patch of skin near my chin.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have noticed more blemishes popping upand my skin looks dry and lifeliess.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear regular Oil of Olay stuff; makes me have allergic break-outs like a sun-of-a-gun, but Total Effects is worth a try if you&#x27;ve had problems with other lines.</li>
            <li> so is this saying much for other Co.</li>
            <li> When I used other face creams they would make my face super greasy or not enough and my skin tended to be dry.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have fair/dry skin that I usually classify as sensitive and live in a dry hot climate.</li>
            <li> I live in the high mountain deserts and this product gives your face a break from the harsh elements here.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and this product made my skin look really oily about half way through the day.</li>
            <li> This comment hit me pretty hard as I usually do not wear any makeup, but ever since I was a teenager I have worn the Oil of Olay Moisturizing SPF-15 Cream.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not very much in this container and unless you&#x27;re up to smooshing your face, it does not go very far.  </li>
            <li> I like how it feels (lightweight) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a general moisturizer to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive moisturizers, and I still keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its the classic Olay.</li>
            <li> My skin was red and so sensitive, I could not even use my regular cleanser or a Cortisone cream, the only thing that would not hurt when using was a local organic soap and Nivea cream.</li>
            <li> Despite it&#x27;s high price (compared to other brands)</li>
            <li> really like this day lotion with sunscreen, though I wish it had just a bit less shine to it for combo skin.  </li>
            <li> the ones i&#x27;ve previously ordered worked really well.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s definitely the moisturizer and not dry skin)</li>
            <li> my face (mostly temple areas, forhead, chin, apple of cheeks, tip of nose and neck) had swollen hovey area, is tight, extremely hot to the touch, and overall uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and it absorbs really well leaving my skin feeling soft and silky and keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li> Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning.</li>
            <li> Every moisturizer I have tried soaks right in and my skin is back to feeling tight and dry within hours.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin though I notice after applying my skin gets a slight-greasy sheen to it, which would normally be a deal breaker, but it goes away once the product fully sinks in, usually a half hour.  </li>
            <li> I switched back to my other brand of moisturizer and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Expensive to buy in a drugstore but a good dead to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After a few days, it looked better, was less red, less chapped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that other people didn&#x27;t experience the same thing.</li>
            <li> I see on the ingredients list that the other form of vitamin C, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is still present but the Ascorbic Acid has been completely removed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this along with my other Olay products leaves my skin soft, tighter and protected.</li>
            <li> But just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t look past was a light dermatitic rash over almost all of my face just a few days into a once-daily application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only wish it could have higher UV protection, at least +50.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my main moisturizer for a few years.</li>
            <li> It did not help, however, with the few older sun spots that I have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it only that it&#x27;s pretty thick and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> and I feel this won&#x27;t last me long at all</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but it lasts a very long time, you only need a bit to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves my face feeling moisturized instead of dry and irritable.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not super sensitive and I&#x27;ve never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before.</li>
            <li> This was the most money I have ever spent on a face lotion, and unfortunately in this case you do NOT get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> When the weather is so dry in the winter, this one is not enough to keep the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not keeping it long enough to find out if it works well long term.</li>
            <li> This is really my beauty secret for looking young...</li>
            <li> Very fancy bottle, when you pump it out comes that thick, greasy, white sunscreen everyone has run into before.</li>
            <li> Limited search results, only Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis and when I began to notice laugh lines and small, long creases in my forehead at just 29 years of age, I freaked a little.  </li>
            <li> However, I was horribly wrong; this not only made me break out in little pimples all over my face but left my face even more oily.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive, but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Oil of Olay products with no incident, and I was actually trying to switch to this from the Neutrogena anti-aging product I had been using simply because of the name brand.</li>
            <li> If your skin is even a little bit sensitive, I advise you against using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who wants to streamline their morning routine and seriously care for their skin should definitely get this product.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn&#x27;t fully absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!)</li>
            <li> After becoming unemployed recently, I was afraid I would have to give up my Olay for something cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would avoid or try this when you don&#x27;t need to be in public for a few days!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that according to the directions you should reapply every 2 hours, which is not very practical if your on the go during the day</li>
            <li> That has not completely gone away but it is diminished.  </li>
            <li> Then again, if my skin gives a warning as to what this could do in the long run, be advised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I look younger than before I used this product and can&#x27;t say that I have aged beyond my years since using it either.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you can find it cheaper with coupons and sales in stores, but that&#x27;s few and far between.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and my skin already feels tighter and soooo soft.</li>
            <li> But as I aged, I started to use Olay Total Effects</li>
            <li> but hopefully will keep it looking this way for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer does take a bit long to sink into my skin</li>
            <li> long, and it didn&#x27;t come close to reaching the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other moisturizers with and without an SPF, expensive and cheap, and even other Olay products but always I come back to this one!</li>
            <li> I noticed when doing my makeup the other day that the pores on my cheeks are much smaller then they used to be!</li>
            <li> so it is not going to last a long time even though you only need a few drops for each</li>
            <li> I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from combination acne prone skin and thought that this would be the answer to my problems, with Salicylic acid as one of the ingredients and other multiple promises this moisturizer said it would do.</li>
            <li> I just tried it recently and saw little red spots on my face.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist product actually has an SPF of 25 and the other 2 are SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Even though I use the same amount every day, I usebetween 1 and 8 pumps due to the erratic nature of the delivery system.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and does not irritate my eyes like other facial creams</li>
            <li> In the past 3 months have seen major reduction in deep forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> I could see my skin even show some dry lines in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Olay just seemed to reduce my problem when it comes to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that it has helped my moisturize my dry skin, without it being too greasy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s help me that my dry skin gets better.lam satisfy with this product.</li>
            <li> However, in the winter, my skin does tend to dry out</li>
            <li> tried a store brand to save a few dollars and there really is a big difference, especially in how it feels after application.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay since I was in my late teens mainly because my Mother has used it ever since I can remember.  </li>
            <li> They also thought I am still single</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a strong unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> Not very much product in the container.</li>
            <li> I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you&#x27;re okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but that what makes you skin looks younger in long term.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, only need a little for each use.  </li>
            <li> However, I chose to look past this, as it is a different product with different intended effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels super sorry</li>
            <li> my skin was getting very dry from a rash that I had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I sometimes avoided the greasy mess of regular sunscreen on my face which means I was exposed during lunch breaks and the walk to and from work.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little gritty going on.</li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. 21) and there is a little left, which I expect to run out any day now, so about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 yearsI think it has helped me look a little younger than I am.</li>
            <li> However, compare with other Olay moisturizers, this UV moisturizer is too dry for me.  </li>
            <li> (hydrates well, doesn&#x27;t promote my acne issues, doesn&#x27;t leave me patchy dry with my combination winter skin), the day does not play well with my other products - namely any foundations or tinted BB/CC.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause even when looking at the complete ingredient list of this moisturizer on their website</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause even when looking at the complete ingredient list of this moisturizer on their website</li>
            <li> Skin feels supple and moist throughout the day, which it&#x27;s hard on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my complexion is still great from using it, I just HATE the oily skin!!!</li>
            <li> , at least, ten years younger...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on it.  </li>
            <li> After careful consideration, my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Not even remotely greasy.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days, like consistency and all but don&#x27;t like the packaging (the pump)</li>
            <li> I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> If you like Oil of Olay Total Effects and use it every day you can save a lot of money by signing up to receive this every few months (you pick the frequency of shipment).  </li>
            <li> it does whatever I expected from my cream to do.</li>
            <li> It feels, looks, and smells like regular heavy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Went off it and back on a few times to confirm this product was the culprit, I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as expected....</li>
            <li> Moisturizer SPF 15 is my everyday moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for the last 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months every morning until I recently finished it.</li>
            <li> In my earlier years, I never used moisturizers because they were so heavy</li>
            <li> My bottle, which I purchased at Walmart, stopped pumping after a while, so I figured it was empty.</li>
            <li> but i developed few spots on my forehead though after using it few weeks now.</li>
            <li> but it does feel extra thick, likely due to the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have one very small fine line that I&#x27;m trying to erase and I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic improvements with that yet.</li>
            <li> I went back to my Aveeno lotion, and my skin calmed down after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Just the very very ever so faint smell of sunscreen which I like anyways.</li>
            <li> My face is quite dry and feels yucky and tight after washing.  </li>
            <li> I had stopped this and decided to try other products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products on my face including makeup and cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Purchased from other areas in the past and payed almost double.  </li>
            <li> , I speculated whether this rash could possibly be due to the combination of sunscreen agents in the product (4% octisalate, 2% avobenzone, 1% ensulizole, 1% octocrylene, all of which can cause rashes in some people).  </li>
            <li> I have used one other Olay product with sunscreen in it</li>
            <li> I have used one other Olay product with sunscreen in it</li>
            <li> so I was even more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes, I take care of myself and my skin in other ways, too, but there is no better anti-aging daily moisturizer than this.  </li>
            <li> do not know about any of the other claims,</li>
            <li> I tried Olay because I like other Olay products.</li>
            <li> It work as long as you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I decided to give Olay Total Effects a try</li>
            <li> If I use it too soon after my showers my skin gets slightly red, though it goes away usually within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I bought from the 3 types of Olay total Effect, and I did try them after reading the instruction, There is no magical effect apeard after 1 month</li>
            <li> I am 38 and have never used moisturizers due my oily skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I just got this the other day</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help it as well as help fade the red marks from past pimples.</li>
            <li> On the occasions I do try other lotions, they never measure up.  </li>
            <li> I used other oil olay products and had no problems..</li>
            <li> I will not use any other moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li> Sent to me every other month</li>
            <li> alright but not as well as other lotions I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> With all the products that have been taken off the market due to harmful/toxic agents (ie.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made me look 30, but people do comment that I don&#x27;t look my age, so maybe it&#x27;s due to this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> because the other women are doing it.  </li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel oily, makes me extremely shiny, and has caused me to break out.  </li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t bother me except that I do like the way the other creams are just in a jar</li>
            <li> I have tried switching to other products along the way and have always regretted it (L&#x27;Oreal, Alba).  </li>
            <li> I have not made a repeat purchase because I wanted to try other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> ([...] Due to this unfortunate adverse side effect, I am unable to say whether or not this moisturizer&#x27;s anti-aging properties are effective.        </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use up the bottle and then decide whether to buy it again or go back to Olay Complete, since it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> It feels a little tacky/sticky going on, and it makes my face feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to try a little on your face, in a small area, before putting it on your face; it&#x27;ll save you emotional distress and expense (buying Cortisone cream).</li>
            <li> Having combination skin that changes season to season is so hard, and what I like about total effects is that it&#x27;s an all around cream that offer moisture/SPF protection.</li>
            <li> This cruelty is not worth vanity.  </li>
            <li> Dark blotches around my chin are almost gone</li>
            <li> I use it at least daily, but maybe it should be used 2 times a day for maximum results.</li>
            <li> On average this size container lasts me about 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> This time the bottle pump is defective and the moisturizer is thick and gummy, not the same product I&#x27;m used to at all.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this would go down as my skin became used to it</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I typically use the original Olay moisturizer, but needed something with SPF for summer, this broke me out really badly, after one use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on this making them less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Within a month or two (or less, I don&#x27;t remember after 7 years)</li>
            <li> I started using this and the lines between my eyebrows are 90% less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Ordered Olay 7-1 Anti aging as a previous in store buyer.</li>
            <li> makes it less</li>
            <li> Used it again the next day and by about the third day I had completely broken out in a rash and acne!</li>
            <li> It became smoother, tight and pore less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has sensitive or acne prone skin, and it has the same unpleasant scent found in acne medicine.</li>
            <li> Oh yes, avoid the eye area as it made me itch a little.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like throwing away money - it&#x27;s a little painful).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it after showering and apply the cream (just a little dab) while my skin is moist.</li>
            <li> It also appears to be a little brighter.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li> What a difference four months without this little gem made.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is little greasy for my skin type.</li>
            <li> that does not break my face out, I bought another at walmart, it had the little ball tip on the spout for a security seal, the one I got on here</li>
            <li> , amazon, it did not have the little ball tip on the spout for security seal</li>
            <li> It also burns a little (I have dry/sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and keeps my face/neck moisturized and adds a little glow.  </li>
            <li> A little to greasy for me.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy, I used just a little and that was plenty.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and need a thick moisturizer for winter.</li>
            <li> After using it once, my face was really red and three little patches of hives had broken out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, and unfortunately the lotion is a little too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and just a few months</li>
            <li> Sunscreen in this lotion makes it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, the moisturizer is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It seems we brought product that was expiring and not fit for retail sales.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Fake,don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After applying conscutively for a couple of days, my wife got a few pimples on her face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a waste of money and it is going into the stuff graveyard under the sink.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> The photo lists ascorbic acid as one of the ingredients as well as PEG-4 Laurate and PEG-4 Dilaurate, both of which are missing from what I have in my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> This was really, really heavy for my face.  </li>
            <li> I cancelled my subscription and wish that I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and</li>
            <li> which makes my mascara run all over), because they don&#x27;t stop tearing, and lastly I&#x27;m breaking out like a teenager, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s - haven&#x27;t broken out like this in years.  </li>
            <li> Way too heavy caused breakouts after one use.</li>
            <li> tip did not have seal cap, product felt almost like an empty bottle, as soon as i put it on my face it felt like a thick sludge, not comfortable at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands before, but they all were either too thick for my skin (I am in my mid-30&#x27;s) or would made me break out.</li>
            <li> Box is not original and this is not safe for use I think.</li>
            <li> But it is little pricy for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I need to repair and slow down the damage.</li>
            <li> We came to the sad conclusion that our much anticipated new version of Total Effects with SPF 15 was FAIL!!!  </li>
            <li> but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> the one that i ordered last left welts and burned my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> I am a little surprised that it didnt give me sun  prtection, i have developed freckles on the sides of my cheeks after using this product, very disappointed after a months use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always hard to tell when you see yourself everyday in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Now the redness is gone, but my skin feels tight and dry and started flaking in random spots...</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay, you protected my face from a burn but it was painful anyway.</li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t put on night cream</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> and i am not sure if she would be using it</li>
            <li> To expensive at the store I always hop ebay for my facial products</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out, I usually buy this at walmart n</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read these reviews before trying this product, though I am not sure it would have made a difference--I probably would still have bought it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  </li>
            <li> I called the Olay customer service and the told me the address on the back of the bottle is NOT a licenced import so it could well be a fake product.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well, but within a few hours after putting it on, my face was so oily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> However a  small label had been placed on the bottle claiming it contained sunscreen</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Now as for the anti aging effects for this I am not sure.</li>
            <li> It was very heavy, greasy and over fragrant.  </li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that the lotion was a little thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know how to review this.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin, and I had problem skin through to my late 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for at least 5 years now...</li>
            <li> In my late twenties, I tried just about every moisturizer I could find including rarified ingredient boutique lotions</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again, it was so uncomfortable having itchy skin on my face, knowing that were I to scratch it, I would only make it worse.</li>
            <li> After the night treatment at least I can say I like the way my face feels.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate the stabilized chemical sunscreen, it makes my skin burn and causes hives, which I guess is quite common.  </li>
            <li> At the time I was in my late 20s</li>
            <li> It feels thick and sticky and it never vanishes.</li>
            <li> I tried this for some time, but I found it thick and not effective as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I find a lot of moisturizers to be too thick or too greasy.</li>
            <li> Thick and Creamy.  </li>
            <li> so I have to watch it and go slow.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find any other products that can beat this one.</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate acne and it was really bad for the past couple months, so</li>
            <li> Subtle but results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month in this dry cold weather and my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> the added bonus of two+ weeks of the deep painful acne you get from clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I immediately ceased use of this product today after reading the warning label (which specifically said to discontinue use if signs of a rash or irritation appear) and I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to surrender the entire bottle to my trash can</li>
            <li> ([...] Due to this unfortunate adverse side effect, I am unable to say whether or not this moisturizer&#x27;s anti-aging properties are effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s looking for a preventative moisturizer, after a day or two of use my skin has drastically improved!</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when I was shopping for the non-sunscreen version on Amazon (since that&#x27;s what we were forced to buy!)</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky consistency.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is frustrating since you can&#x27;t get all of the product out of the pump.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.  </li>
            <li> I am doubtful about this product which i purchased recently from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Let you in on a secret...</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after two weeks, hoping that this was just a phase of the product I would have to endure, but alas, my skin just got worse.  </li>
            <li> Worse, the product gave me acne</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed - would have given it a single star, but the night cream deserved mercy.</li>
            <li> It has made a dramatic difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Using this everyday has prevented bad burns when I am somewhere and forget or don&#x27;t have access to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This was also expensive</li>
            <li> This is 100% fake product.</li>
            <li> I had emailed the conglomerate P &amp; G and asked about samples before wasting money on expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake product so would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazon sold me a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but I was admittedly wrong.  </li>
            <li> The containers are identical and I inadvertently ordered the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I was looking for and it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned out to be a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> it is a fake and a bad one at that.</li>
            <li> All over disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my pump feature broke, and my product comes out the side!  </li>
            <li> This product irritated my skin so bad I had to quit using it, it was so</li>
            <li> because, well, 15% off isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad, I discontinued the use</li>
            <li> People are shocked to hear I&#x27;m in my 60s.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this expensive moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed by this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to pass on this one darn it :(</li>
            <li> I am reducing this another star because I hate the way that it dispenses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Chicago and the winter is brutal where the summers can be scorching.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS MOISTURIZER!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite twice daily moisturizer.  Smooth, non-greasy, product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great and it leaves your face looking firmer and smooths away the wrinkles as it promises. Definitely a great product. Packaging is awesome too doesn&#x27;t leave a drop behind in the bottle so you actually can use all 1.7 oz of it.</li>
            <li> I waited until I used this product for a few months before writing a review, to make a fair assessment. I have combination skin--dry and oily but mostly oily--and this moisturizer worked well with my skin type. It left my skin feeling soft and looking dewy. I received compliments on separate occasions on having a glow to my skin. The only issue I have is that according to the directions you should reapply every 2 hours, which is not very practical if your on the go during the day but I guess thats for effective sun protection. I apply once every day, in the morning, and it provides me with soft and healthy looking skin. Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using moisturizers since I was 16, I am 32 now.  I have used Mary Kay, the original Oil of Olay, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing gel.  My face is quite dry and feels yucky and tight after washing.  Every moisturizer I have tried soaks right in and my skin is back to feeling tight and dry within hours.  Not this.  My first application was last night after my shower and I woke up this morning,my face still feeling soft and hydrated.  I hesitate to give 5 stars since I&#x27;ve only been using it 2 days.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  Pleasant moisturizer.  Do not like pump dispenser--wasteful as one never gets all the product out.</li>
            <li> First off, I love Oil of Olay products they are great! But I switched to this moisturizer bc my skin was getting very dry from a rash that I had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is creamy, smells good, &amp; it doesnt make my sensitive skin breakout. I have Acne Prone skin &amp; big pores between my eyebrows and cheeks. I noticed when doing my makeup the other day that the pores on my cheeks are much smaller then they used to be! I didnt use this moisturizer for the \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; effects, just bc of the creaminess of it &amp; Im surprised that it actually minimized my pores. Although it is creamy it doesnt make my skin look extra oily (I have oily skin). I definitely recommend this you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and just a few months I had stopped this and decided to try other products.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find any other products that can beat this one. Now, I&#x27;m back to Olay again!</li>
            <li> I love Olay Total Effects because it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and provides great moisturization. It soaks in into skin very fast and while leaving a silky feel, it is not greasy. It works great with any makeup.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen in this lotion makes it feel heavy. I love this lotion but not with sunscreen. It&#x27;s amazing if you use it as a sunscreen. But I thought I was buying a face lotion.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my favorite daytime facial moisturizer that&#x27;s available at the drugstore at a reasonable price (although the local warehouse had it at half the price for a while!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros? Decent UV protection, light moisture that absorbs pretty quickly and creates a good surface for makeup or powder, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons? The dispenser is frustrating since you can&#x27;t get all of the product out of the pump.  Also, the moisturizer is not cheap.  Oh well, I guess it&#x27;s still cheaper than the department store fancy creams!  Oh yes, avoid the eye area as it made me itch a little.</li>
            <li> i truly enjoy using product and am switching to such and was a former Avon Rep . so is this saying much for other Co.</li>
            <li> This is my go to Oil of Olay lotion - and it is amazing!  I have been using it for years and really noticed a difference when I have stopped using it.  It does all that it claims - excellent lotion.</li>
            <li> 47 years old here.  Does well what this sort of product is best at: plumps the skin by locking in moisture in the way \\&quot;regular\\&quot; lotions won&#x27;t.  Subtle but results I notice.  SLIGHTLY more even skin (less age spots appearance).  It does leave a bit of a shine I&#x27;m not crazy about, but otherwise I love this lotion. I have oily skin in the forehead and nose, and drier skin on the cheeks.  Male user here, and it makes a great post-shave lotion on the cheeks.  Usually don&#x27;t put on night cream and this works fine 24/7 for mild but noticeable smoother skin results, and slightly plumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this day lotion with sunscreen, though I wish it had just a bit less shine to it for combo skin.  It&#x27;s the lotion I use every day now for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with oily t-zone. I like this product so far. It provides the moisture I&#x27;ve been looking for. I didn&#x27;t break out when I first started using this product. I would like to see a higher SPF content though.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product by Olay; I like their other products, but when I put it on, it made my face break out in hives. My recommendation is to try a little on your face, in a small area, before putting it on your face; it&#x27;ll save you emotional distress and expense (buying Cortisone cream).</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while and it worked very well on my skin.  When Olay came up with regenerizer, I switched, and like it best.  However, I still do use this as a middle of the day moisturezer when needed, and it still works very well.</li>
            <li> My face is covered in hives and the areas around my eyes are swollen.  Actually my entire face and neck is swollen wherever this product touched.  I reccommend trying this product and leaving it on for 2-3 days before deeming it safe.  This is the result after day 2.  I put it on Sunday evening and by Monday evening my face felt hot like I had a glass of red wine, then when I woke up Tuesday morning (today) my face (mostly temple areas, forhead, chin, apple of cheeks, tip of nose and neck) had swollen hovey area, is tight, extremely hot to the touch, and overall uncomfortable.  Went to the dr. to get steroid cream and took Benadryl so I could even work today.  I have used this product in the past. (same bottle) Not sure what has combined to create the perfect storm this time.  I don&#x27;t use any other products on my face including makeup and cleansers.  If you have sensitive skin I would avoid or try this when you don&#x27;t need to be in public for a few days!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs well and is very pleasant. I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; effects yet after 4 weeks. Previously I used Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer SPF 30 for sensitive skin, which is a great product, but I have fine lines on my forehead now and wanted to try to combat them. So far no changes to my forehead. I&#x27;ll use up the bottle and then decide whether to buy it again or go back to Olay Complete, since it is less expensive. In the end, it seems the most important thing to do for your skin is just wear a daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> I have used everything, from Avon to Clinique, BioTherm, you name it I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on it.  I have even tried Dermalogica.  This product is WONDERFUL.  It actually leaves my face feeling moisturized instead of dry and irritable.  It cost 1/3 the price I was paying for moisturizer.  Fragrance FREE - What a concept!!  Great job Oil of Olay.  I can now moisturize my face without my eyes burning and tearing for an hour afterward.  May skin feels baby soft after I put this on it and it does not burn and itch, in the dry weather it brings great relief.  I wake up in the morning and I cannot wait to put my daily moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I love Olay brand and have been using Olay products. However, compare with other Olay moisturizers, this UV moisturizer is too dry for me.  I could see my skin even show some dry lines in the afternoon.  So every time I have to use it together with some moisturizing lotion.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy it any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for about 10 years now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I have combination oily/dry skin, and I had problem skin through to my late 20s. After many trials, this was the best moisturizer I could find that properly moisturized my skin (protecting it against Canada&#x27;s cold) and didn&#x27;t cause more breakouts.  In fact it kept my skin soft and supple enough for the blemishes to heal quickly.      Now I&#x27;m in my 30s and living in the tropics, and I&#x27;m still happy with it; the SPF factor is essential for my daily routine, as I prefer to use the heavier sunblocks only when I&#x27;m out in the sun for prolonged periods as it really clogs my pores.  After five years of living 10 degrees north of the equator, my skin has held up remarkably well, with few signs of aging.  I also like the fragrance-free lotion, as I find today&#x27;s products are all too heavily scented, and I pay good money for actual perfume already.    I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive moisturizers, and I still keep coming back to this one.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Olay is made by Proctor and Gamble, a company that still tests on animals even when it is NOT required by law.  They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      This cruelty is not worth vanity.  I&#x27;ll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice with the same results.  My face swelled up with hives.</li>
            <li> I have found an introductory set of moisturizer for day, for night and the cleanser. Since the time has come for my 32-year-old skin to start receiving some boost to retain its young looks, I thought this product would help. After the first application, it did seem to make a positive difference but a couple of days later, my skin turned red and sensitive. I continued using the products for a week, thinking that maybe my skin needs to adjust (!). And then stopped, since I could feel a stinging sensation with every application. My skin was red and so sensitive, I could not even use my regular cleanser or a Cortisone cream, the only thing that would not hurt when using was a local organic soap and Nivea cream. Now the redness is gone, but my skin feels tight and dry and started flaking in random spots... You can only imagine how I must look. Thank goodness, I stay at home with kids and do not have to deal with the look at a workplace.    Now note, my skin was never sensitive and I was able to use any moisturizer. I am very dissapointed with choosing this product, I trusted a well known brand and a more expensive price.</li>
            <li> Purchased of this product represented a great savings.  Purchased from other areas in the past and payed almost double.  All aspects of the purchase were professionally handled with emphasis on custumer relations.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for the last couple of weeks.  I break out very easily, and was worried this would break me out, but it hasn&#x27;t!! Yay!!  I use this once a day in the morning under my makeup.  I love the sunscreen smell.  It is very light and feels good on my skin.  I am mainly using it to prevent wrinkles. I don&#x27;t have any yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on this making them less noticeable.  I think my skin looks only better, though.  I have had a male co-worker say I look \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; just out of the blue.  It makes my skin look real healthy and dewy.  No acne and just really nice looking skin.  So I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Very good item, cheap in my opinion and works wonders!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month in this dry cold weather and my skin is glowing. Not younger, but healthier and moist appearance. I&#x27;m not buying overpriced Lancome, Estee or LaPraire creams that I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years. Olay is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I offer no recommendation as to the effectiveness of this product.  My wife likes it.  Any husband, of long standing, who expresses an opinion on an anti-aging products effectiveness better make sure he weighs his words carefully.  After careful consideration, my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> It has a very good moisturizer effect on face and neck, it also protects your skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> Greasy and heavy.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake but decided to keep it.  I did not mean to get the one with the SPF sunscreen as I have ordered the one without it for years.  This feels quite greasy in comparison.  I would not order it again...I will be more careful next time!</li>
            <li> I have used this amazing moisturizer for years and was excited to find it at such a reduced price but was disappointed when told that I would not be receiving it at the same price on an ongoing basis.  It was originally listed as a product I could receive as often as I wanted it sent to me.</li>
            <li> My wife love this product. It really works well in her skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion. I love that it is on Amazon Prime. It is perfect for a busy mother of 4 to feel like I am taking proper care of my skin. I use it every day and sometimes multiple times a day. Not greasy but perfect.</li>
            <li> Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis and when I began to notice laugh lines and small, long creases in my forehead at just 29 years of age, I freaked a little.  Then I began shopping around for a good anti-aging moisturizer.  Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer (I&#x27;ve been using their original beauty fluid since I was 16) and how gentle it&#x27;s been on my skin, I decided to see what they had to offer and came across the Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15.  Deciding to give it a try, I bought it on May 21st and was eager to add it to my regime the moment it arrived on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular moisturizer in Olay&#x27;s vast line of products is purported to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Minimize the appearance of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;2) Nourish the skin with rich moisturization&lt;br /&gt;3) Enhance and even out skin tone&lt;br /&gt;4) Gently exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;5) Minimize and refine pores&lt;br /&gt;6) Defense against free radicals&lt;br /&gt;7) Subtle \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; of the skin for a more youthful appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to do all this with sunscreen (to prevent the aging effects of UV damage), vitamins (B3, B5 and E, which all hydrate and improve circulation) and anti-oxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first application, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the original beauty fluid, that it in fact felt thicker, almost like the consistency of your basic sunscreen (it even smells like one).  However, I chose to look past this, as it is a different product with different intended effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I couldn&#x27;t look past was a light dermatitic rash over almost all of my face just a few days into a once-daily application.  I immediately ceased use of this product today after reading the warning label (which specifically said to discontinue use if signs of a rash or irritation appear) and I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to surrender the entire bottle to my trash can (it&#x27;s like throwing away money - it&#x27;s a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing my personal history and the fact that I have slightly sensitive skin, I speculated whether this rash could possibly be due to the combination of sunscreen agents in the product (4% octisalate, 2% avobenzone, 1% ensulizole, 1% octocrylene, all of which can cause rashes in some people).  I have used one other Olay product with sunscreen in it (Olay Complete UV Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 15) and did not have a reaction so it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause even when looking at the complete ingredient list of this moisturizer on their website ([...] Due to this unfortunate adverse side effect, I am unable to say whether or not this moisturizer&#x27;s anti-aging properties are effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall let this product review serve as a cautionary tale to people with sensitive skin that the Olay Total Effects line may not be the right choice for them.

            <li> I love olay products, but this moisturizer was heavy and made my face shiny and greasy feeling--very similar to how most sunscreens feel on your face.  I tried powder on top of the moisturizer to reduce the shiny look, only to find that if I touched my face (at all!) the powder would sort of roll off my face in greasy clumps. Not attractive.  Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, and I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I apply it twice a day and it keeps my face moisturized and soft without feeling greasy or making my face break out.  Additionally, I believe it has evened out my skin tone a bit.  This is the first Olay product I&#x27;ve tried and I plan to keep using it and also try other Olay products.  Amazon has a very good price for this product, so I see no need to run around trying to catch it on sale locally.  My only criticism is that it is only 1.7 ounces so it is not going to last a long time even though you only need a few drops for each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Amazingly, this product lasted me 10 months!  It only takes a couple of drops and spreads so nicely that the 1.7 oz. container is sufficient and, actually, cost effective when you consider it contains an SPF 15 sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> I have used this face cream for probably a couple of years now and I love it. It gives me plenty of moisture and keeps my face looking great.</li>
            <li> Olay makes great skin care products and this is one of them. My skin has a much more youthful look after using Total Effects. The price on amazon is very competitive and on top of that I receive an additional discount by signing up to  have the product shipped every 6 months. I will probably change that to every 3 months since the product has impressed me and now know that I will be using it daily. I use it after showering and apply the cream (just a little dab) while my skin is moist.</li>
            <li> I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it&#x27;s unscented.  (Hurrah, if I want perfume, I prefer what I use!)  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it ever since. It&#x27;s not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  If you wear make-up it&#x27;ll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don&#x27;t look my age! (85) I don&#x27;t wear make-up except for eyes and mouth, so what people see is what&#x27;s there, wrinkles and all.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> For a Christmas present and she told me she like the gift because she like Olay for a gift for her face.</li>
            <li> Cream is light and effective - been using it for years</li>
            <li> I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash. My skin is not super sensitive and I&#x27;ve never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before. I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you&#x27;re okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days. I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be fair to give this item one star. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault that my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it, and like I said, it did work well everywhere else. I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and female. I&#x27;m writing a review for the SPF-15 version. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good SPF that included anti-aging with SPF which is, oddly enough, rather hard to find in a drugstore brand that&#x27;s affordable. Luckily for me, I found Olay&#x27;s Total Effects. I tried finding this in CVS, but they only carried the non-SPF version, so I found it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and I have no complaints. It goes on pretty smooth, isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and doesn&#x27;t burn/sting as some SPF moisturizers do. I haven&#x27;t broken out or found myself to be any more oily than normal (and I have very oily skin). It feels a little gritty going on. I can&#x27;t explain it. It almost feels like there are tiny bits of something in it that give it a tiny bit of gritty texture, but once it is blended in you don&#x27;t feel it anymore. My makeup still blends well over it and it seems to hold up pretty well throughout the day. It&#x27;s too early to really speak for any miraculous anti-aging properties, but I have noticed my face seems well-hydrated and the dry areas around my eyes seem better. Overall, I really like this and I think it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than the majority of drugstore daily moisturizers in price and quality.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite moisturizer - I use this daily throughout the year.  It is perfect for my very sensitive, rosacea-prone, over 50 skin.  Goes on smoothly.  Not even remotely greasy. As effective and much more cost effective than comparable high end department store items.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days, like consistency and all but don&#x27;t like the packaging (the pump) and I feel this won&#x27;t last me long at all which is a bummer given it is on the pricey side for me.</li>
            <li> After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it.  I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy.  But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using.  I had always thought my skin was oily, so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin.  I think I was drying my skin out, causing it to produce extra oil to compensate.  Anyway, I&#x27;m now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great.  Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties, since I just turned 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using the Total Effects, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer.  It also appears to be a little brighter.  The tone is evened out some, as well.  I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose.  That has not completely gone away but it is diminished.  I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream) but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing.  Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes.  The only smell I get is from the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle.  I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount.  One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. 21) and there is a little left, which I expect to run out any day now, so about 3 months.  I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products.</li>
            <li> i trust this brand for years.been using it for almost 4 years..im not having any breakouts.lots of benefit to this 1 product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from combination acne prone skin and thought that this would be the answer to my problems, with Salicylic acid as one of the ingredients and other multiple promises this moisturizer said it would do. However, I was horribly wrong; this not only made me break out in little pimples all over my face but left my face even more oily. This was also expensive so I was even more disappointed. In conclusion, I will NEVER purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have been usingOlay Total Effects for many years now.  It is light weight, absorbs quickly and well, does not have overpowering scent and even comes unscented.  The use of this product provides great moisturization as well as SPF protection. One of the most economical of the Olay products in retail, purchase here provides even more cost savings.  Dewy but not gooey.  I would recommend for anyone over the age of 55 for the just right amount of moisture without grease.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE  AND IT SEEMS TO WORK</li>
            <li> I use total effects every morning and evening. It softens but does not clog my face nor make it feel oily. It has been part of my daily routine for years.</li>
            <li> I love rhis product! Nothing is better for moisturizing my face especially in the northeast winter time. I use it morning and night...even around my eyes. It is the best! And Im so glad to have it on automatic delivery frim Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.  Arrived on time and as scheduled.  I wish there was a higher SPF for this product (it&#x27;s only SPF 15) but I love that it&#x27;s unscented, that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunblock.  Everything I need in one product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 20 years.  I&#x27;m 45 and I&#x27;m often told I look, at least, ten years younger...  Yes, I take care of myself and my skin in other ways, too, but there is no better anti-aging daily moisturizer than this.  I use the night cream, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of some of the good reviews but I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would rate it highly. It feels and smells like sunscreen lotion and stings. I feel like washing it off as soon as i put it on. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all. It feels thick and sticky and it never vanishes. I&#x27;m not keeping it long enough to find out if it works well long term. I&#x27;ll be returning it as soon as possible. Now I have to go back and look for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion along with Moisture On-Call for years.  This winter has been especially brisk, so my skin was still dry no matter how much product I put on.&lt;br /&gt;This weekend, I saw the Olay at my local warehouse store (3.4fl oz/100ml size) and decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by the results!  My skin now feels soft and moisturized.  I will continue using this product because it is fragrance free (so is Clinique), but in additon: oil-free and has SPF-15.</li>
            <li> as a gentle sunscreen for the face, I like it.  do not know about any of the other claims, but like I said...it is a nice gentle sunscreen, that reminds me of the beach when I was younger....I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you like Oil of Olay Total Effects and use it every day you can save a lot of money by signing up to receive this every few months (you pick the frequency of shipment).  This is the cheapest I have ever been able to buy this product.  I think this is fantastic.  I love Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products for years now and decided to try the Olay Total Effects - Advanced anti-aging skin care.  I did see a noticeable difference in my face but got a rash on my neck that looked like a sunburn and felt like one too.  So, I recommend it but not for sensitive skin.  Then again, if my skin gives a warning as to what this could do in the long run, be advised.</li>
            <li> The package arrive in 3 business days and in good condition, however the product expiration date is 8/2015 just 3 months from now. It seems we brought product that was expiring and not fit for retail sales.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not any better than other products that I have used.</li>
            <li> For me, this has been a great all around moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and appreciate that this lotion does not have a greasy feel or make break out.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps keep the face well moisturized all day. I even saw a nice improvement in my skin tone. It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about UV rays when I have this on as well. There was no problems with acne at all - but I can&#x27;t say it \\&quot;helped\\&quot; it either. Overall great investment.</li>
            <li> blocks the sun and moisturizes in one quick step. leaves skin smooth for the whole day and prevents advanced premature aging due to the sun. like it.</li>
            <li> i love Olay products and this one is perfect for aging skin/ use everyday on fine wrinkles and it WORKS...el fed</li>
            <li> Another produc t that I have depended on for decades has been changed and no longer fits my needs. I tried Olay because I like other Olay products. It seems as though this total effects product is going to work well for my Rosacea and aging skin problems.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using Olay for as long as I can remember, which is why I&#x27;m very familiar with its beauty fluid&#x27;s packaging and the scent. I started using Olay when my mom went on a trip to Canada and brought home a bottle of Olay Complete for me. They didn&#x27;t sell Olay in the Philippines then and you could only find this product at duty free shops. I loved Complete and finished the entire jar. When Olay Total Effects was launched, I was intrigued because of the many benefits it claims that it gives. I have combination (most of the time dry) skin, and Olay just seemed to reduce my problem when it comes to my dry skin. I have been using Olay ever since. I&#x27;m 25 and I don&#x27;t have that much lines on my face YET, which is why I can&#x27;t really attest to Olay&#x27;s claim to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. What I do know is that it has helped my moisturize my dry skin, without it being too greasy. Plus, it has SPF. What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> This is 100% fake product. Box is not original and this is not safe for use I think. Please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! makes my skin soft and smooth! glowing! I love the SPF that protects my face all day!</li>
            <li> Best one for the money. It work as long as you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for two years, it is comfortable lightweight and helps protect against sun damage.  I trust the Olay brand.</li>
            <li> I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for ten years now. This is the only moisturizer that wont clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Excellent and the price is great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fake,don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> my only cream....love this soo much</li>
            <li> I had severe acne as a teenager and now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s I have an occasional breakout.  I would always read in the beauty magazines that you should apply a moisturizer on your face but I was reluctant because of my acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;m not sure why I decided to give Olay Total Effects a try but I am so glad I did.  I have been using it every day for over a year now.  It does not make my skin breakout at all (a big plus in my book).  It makes my skin very smooth and gives me that \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look.  It also helps my foundation look more natural looking because the moisturizer is so hydrating.  I also like the fact that it protects my skin from the sun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer.  Despite it&#x27;s high price (compared to other brands) it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of months now, and felt that my skin was looking better (younger, clearer, fresher) but it&#x27;s always hard to tell when you see yourself everyday in the mirror. I just looked back on some old photos and happened to notice that there is a huge difference in my skin, so very happy I started using this. My friend also pointed out something similar the other day, so feeling pretty good about it. I did accidentally buy the regular version a couple of times (non-SPF) so would appreciate it if the packaging was a little more obvious, but that is a minor issue. I should say that I have also been using their Regenerist exfoliating scrub, and the micro-dermabrasion home kit too. Both great.</li>
            <li> used for years and love it.  absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  tried a store brand to save a few dollars and there really is a big difference, especially in how it feels after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  I have been using Aveeno for years but I like this moisturizer so much better.      I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL say that they&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay for decades.  If that doesn&#x27;t make you want to try it for yourself, I don&#x27;t know what will.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate that the smell of this product is neutral.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two months now.  I cannot attest to its anti-aging qualities because I am 20, and do not have fine lines or wrinkles, though I have been using it as a &amp;#34;preventative medicine&amp;#34; of sorts.  This lotion goes on very smoothly, though does have a slight scent to it of sunscreen.  If I use it too soon after my showers my skin gets slightly red, though it goes away usually within an hour.  I have normal skin though I notice after applying my skin gets a slight-greasy sheen to it, which would normally be a deal breaker, but it goes away once the product fully sinks in, usually a half hour.  All in all, this product has made my skin very soft after once-twice daily use, I have not broken out from it, and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer.  I have combination skin and I never break out with it.  I also have rosacea and it has no acids and actually has vitamins that are good for rosacea.  It has sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate as well.  I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone with combination or even oily skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Amazon for this wonderful product.I love this product.Want to buy it again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this expensive moisturizer.  It was very heavy, greasy and over fragrant.  I had emailed the conglomerate P &amp; G and asked about samples before wasting money on expensive products.  They want you to join a club to receive samples and be bombarded with marketing emails.  Guess I&#x27;ll stay with Clinique - I can try before I buy.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and very quick!  Thanks</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m nearly 31 now, I&#x27;ve begun to notice my skin looking aged, with fine lines and age spots taking center stage. After seeing all the supposedly amazing benefits of this product, I decided to try it. After 5 uses, I found that it had given me nothing aside from severe cystic acne I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has sensitive or acne prone skin, and it has the same unpleasant scent found in acne medicine. I will be giving the remaining portion of the product away.</li>
            <li> The dispencer is easy to \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; amount of moisturizer needed for one application. consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply, it&#x27;s very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist UV and aging! very convenient. But just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Olay Total Effects and have been using the regular Total Effects daily moisturizer for years.  After becoming unemployed recently, I was afraid I would have to give up my Olay for something cheaper. I found the subscription option at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it for at least $5 cheaper than anywhere I can find it locally.  The UV SPF 15 was even cheaper than the regular, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This SPF 15 variety does not feel like a moisturizer at all.  It feels a little tacky/sticky going on, and it makes my face feel tight and dry. I do not normally have sensitive skin, but I felt a mild burn after using it.  The smell of sunscreen is also obvious.  I can see using this in the middle of summer when I&#x27;m slathering on the sunscreen anyway, but I would only use this specifically when needing extra facial UV protection...not as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used as gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> I am doubtful about this product which i purchased recently from amazon.com. After applying conscutively for a couple of days, my wife got a few pimples on her face. She is worried about the same and i am not sure if she would be using it furher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not expect this to happen at all. Dejected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for at least 5 years now... can&#x27;t remember exactly when I started or how I was introduced but ever since, I&#x27;ve been using it!  It&#x27;s the perfect combination of moisturizer and SPF protection for everyday use.  (I always use something stronger than SPF 15 on my face when at the beach or spending a lot of time in the sun of course.)  It moisturizes beautifully and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling slimy and oily during the day.  I apply it after cleaning my face in the morning and let it soak in while brushing my teeth before applying makeup for the day.  If I&#x27;m not wearing a full load of makeup, i.e. foundation, I usually follow it up with a few brushstrokes of Benefit&#x27;s face powder such as Dandelion or Georgia for a quick and easy out-the-door look.  I was recently in Tanzania for research and mistakenly thought I would be able to find a bottle somewhere along the way.  Although there were many other Olay products available in the area I was unable to find this one.  What a difference four months without this little gem made.  I could see and feel the difference in my skin - it wasn&#x27;t as smooth and clear as usual and the affects of the sun on my face without the daily facial sunscreen was undeniably noticeable.  I tried to use regular lotion and a sunscreen during this time period of course but in confession, the days I was only in the office I sometimes avoided the greasy mess of regular sunscreen on my face which means I was exposed during lunch breaks and the walk to and from work.  And yes, it made a difference.  I was so happy to be with my Olay moisturizer again once back home and won&#x27;t be found without it again!  I have tried several other moisturizers with and without an SPF, expensive and cheap, and even other Olay products but always I come back to this one!</li>
            <li> Olay total effects 7-in-1 Antiaging UV Mosistrizer softens the skin and firms up the skin of a 79 year old.</li>
            <li> One of the best product available in market. A little greasy but that what makes you skin looks younger in long term.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 2 weeks and have noticed a big difference in my skin.  Dark blotches around my chin are almost gone and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle-free.  I will be using this product for the rest of my life!!!</li>
            <li> I bought from the 3 types of Olay total Effect, and I did try them after reading the instruction, There is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence, The company was very good in logistic maters.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years.  I like it because it has the SPF.  It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; products.  Of course it won&#x27;t stop the aging process, but it does make your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I am 38 and have never used moisturizers due my oily skin and breakouts. This product is by far the best that I have used. It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s absorbed quickly by skin, it evens out my skin tone and minimized my lines. It has made a dramatic difference in my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  My husband started using it and he loves it too.  Expensive to buy in a drugstore but a good dead to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just got this the other day so I don&#x27;t have a longterm review of the product, however I&#x27;m almost certain this is just sunscreen shoved in a teeny bottle and marketed as anti-aging cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same issue as others - my eyes are burning!! And yes - it reeks of SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself $15 dollars and just buy regular sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if I magically appear 10 years younger in a few weeks I&#x27;ll edit this review - don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is easy to use with the pump.  It&#x27;s not greasy and blends right into my skin leaving it feeling silky smooth.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles at all.  People are shocked to hear I&#x27;m in my 60s.  Yes, some of it is genetic, but I&#x27;ve temporarily switched to other products and within 4 weeks saw my skin looking less healthy.  Went back to this and got that healthy glow back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.  It made my skin look refreshed and the wrinkles seemed less prominent.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My sister originally told me about this product.  She&#x27;s used so many different products for her sunspots and loves this one the best especially for the price.  So far, I&#x27;m loving it too.</li>
            <li> I am always forgetting the sunscreen for my face in the Northwest. I can fool you in the spring time when it can be really cloudy but can get a sunburn.  Using this everyday has prevented bad burns when I am somewhere and forget or don&#x27;t have access to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Look for Costco Coupons. After i bought this found better price at costco..Other than that its the classic Olay. Nothing great!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the local RiteAid about a month ago because a young teenager told me that I look like their Grandma(I am 40 years old).  This comment hit me pretty hard as I usually do not wear any makeup, but ever since I was a teenager I have worn the Oil of Olay Moisturizing SPF-15 Cream.  Over the years that cream has been great on my sensitive, ruddy, rosacea skin.  But I am quite sensitive to makeup so I never wear it.  I saw this 7 in 1 product and saw that it had a tint in it, and SPF, and took away fine lines, and it might help with my ruddy complexion, so I paid the $21 and gave it a try.  It seems to have the consistency of a light makeup base, and it also has a light scent.  Not a bad scent, it sort of reminds me of a high-end perfume, but very light.  Nevertheless I can smell it all day and it does not bother me.  I have found that this cream seems to act as a protectant, and also seems to keep moisture in.  Because my face is extremely soft and clear ever since using this product.  I must say that it is the softest and clearest that it has ever been.  I am so very happy with this product that I wanted to come and do this review.  So, my daily makeup routine is to put on my original Olay SPF-15 moisturing cream, and then put this 7 in 1 product on, and then I put on mascara.  I have never felt better! :)</li>
            <li> So easy to use, especially the dispenser.  Goes on smoothly and soaks in nicely.  Been using Olay for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product and value on Amazon. I like the SPF 15 also since I sunburn very easily. I live in the high mountain deserts and this product gives your face a break from the harsh elements here. Not greasy and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> It smooths and hydrates well but I think it is little greasy for my skin type. I have oily skin all over and oilier in T area.&lt;br /&gt;I apply powder on this to cover all the shine. So far (3 days use) it has not no adverse reaction on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay since I was in my late teens mainly because my Mother has used it ever since I can remember.  I am now in my late twenties and believe I owe my good skin to Olay Total Effects.  It is soft, smooth and honestly, apart from a few soft lines on my forehead, I have absolutely no wrinkles.  I reckon it is this moisturizer that has stopped them from forming and hopefully continues to do so well into my thirties.</li>
            <li> My favorite,,,wear it every AM and before I go to bed at night....was on  a cruise in April.....I am 71 years old....and I had a bunch of ladies asked what I used on my skin.....that I DID Not look my age......I said OIL of OLAY...try it....get it here .....its cheaper....Love it....Jewel</li>
            <li> great buy..i use oil of olay all the time. To expensive at the store I always hop ebay for my facial products</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate acne and it was really bad for the past couple months, so I was hoping this would help it as well as help fade the red marks from past pimples. Before using this I did not think my skin was that sensitive because I never broke out into hives before. After using it once, my face was really red and three little patches of hives had broken out. I had heard such good reviews about this product I assumed it was something else that was making my face break out, so I used it a few more times and each time the hives got worse. I finally stopped using it and started using another face lotion, and after two days the hives were all gone. If your skin is even a little bit sensitive, I advise you against using this product. This was the most money I have ever spent on a face lotion, and unfortunately in this case you do NOT get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I could immediate tell a difference when touching my face after using this for the first time. I only use it at night, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this for some time, but I found it thick and not effective as a moisturizer.  I would recommend it as a sunscreen as it is made for the face.</li>
            <li> Been using Oil of Olay since my early twenties and am 71 now! When Olay first came out with this line I started using it!! Love, love it!! It has a SPF 15 and for me the best is I can purchase it unscented which my sinuses appreciate!! Not bragging but I have been told I look 10 to 15 years younger than I am!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist what would be the best moisturizer to buy and she recommended all Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> In my late twenties, I tried just about every moisturizer I could find including rarified ingredient boutique lotions but my skin remained dry, hot, itchy, flaky, and I was seeing laugh lines around my eyes.  I was about to give up hope until my mother, who likes to shop at dollar stores, came to visit and bought me this at the full $20 price.  I have been using Oil of Olay Total Effects ever since.  I am hesitant to even try the regenerist because I like this so well.  On the occasions I do try other lotions, they never measure up.  My skin thanked me after the first application.  After a few days, it looked better, was less red, less chapped.  Within a month or two (or less, I don&#x27;t remember after 7 years) I had no lines near my eyes, my skin feels soft and comfortable unless I abuse it.  When I abuse it, this lotion makes it feel better.  People consistently guess my age to be 5-8 years younger than I am even though I have grey hair.  While they swear it&#x27;s not because of the immaturity, it&#x27;s either that or OoO T.E. lotion.   I almost never need more than a tiny amount the size of a pencil eraser to cover my face, neck and hands. (Keep the cap or it dries out.) I use this UV version in the morning and a non-UV version at night.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a facial moisturizer that works as good or better than advertised.  Absolutely worth the money.  2012 update: Still using this product and still highly recommend it, but sometimes switch it up with the Regenerist (comes in a similar container but squirts out the top) which I can now also recommend.  Just had several people my age (near 40 now, when did that happen?), and the lady doing my facial tell me that I have wonderful, young looking skin and again guess that I&#x27;m years younger than I am.  I have minimal wrinkling and my skin feels good.  I don&#x27;t have a problem using either product near my eyes. I do have some coloration problems after a tanning situation- the Regenerist may be slightly better forcoloration issues, but I can&#x27;t say for sure. I get an even silkier feel to my skin from the Regenerist.  Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize your neck and hands, everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and have been using this product since my mid-20s. I think my skin looks great, compared to others my age, and I plan to continue using this! Very light, helps with wrinkles (fine fine ones - not for deep ones), and has SPF! Perfect for every day and under makeup.</li>
            <li> I change a lot of creams from different brands from $70.00-15.00, and  stoped on thus one because its just working form me it does whatever I expected from my cream to do. I might give 5 start and some 1 start stuff like this is very personal. so, u have to try first to find out if it will work for u or not. I love it and will buy over and over!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. My skin gets dryer in cool weather and this bit greasy cream is what i need! No stretching feeling at all! Drys very fast!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t laugh. My wife has been using this for years and I tried it on my face for my drying skin.  Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning. Amazing. At Amazon prices you can do this. If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy.  I know I sound like a girl. So be it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic. It didn&#x27;t come with it&#x27;s product box. So i really dont trust this product. I ordered 2 different Olay products, from 2 separate orders and they both came in a product box. But this one, it just came in a shipping box.</li>
            <li> I generally beleive in Olay products. Good results for the money. This product is a nice moisturizer but hasnt done anything extraordinary. I am a little surprised that it didnt give me sun  prtection, i have developed freckles on the sides of my cheeks after using this product, very disappointed after a months use. Thanks for reading this review</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I really like it. It smooths on nicely, keeps my face moisturized without being greasy, and does not cause me to break out. I generally put on a light coat after showering and then mix the moisturizer with my foundation when getting ready for the day. One of the best things about the product is that at the end of the day I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get this stuff off my face\\&quot; feeling. I also use their night cream (Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment) and like that too.     As for the anti-aging claims - who really knows if any lotion is working? This lotion keeps my face moisturized, so the lines probably don&#x27;t show as much and the UV element probably helps too. Can&#x27;t say that I look younger than before I used this product and can&#x27;t say that I have aged beyond my years since using it either. It is effective, but certainly not a miracle cream. (When someone finds one of those would you let me know - lol.)    Effective product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years I love the way it feels on my face.  People tell me I hold my looks good they would never guess I was my age.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> use all the time. Moisture &amp; sunscreen in one.</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out, I usually buy this at walmart n that does not break my face out, I bought another at walmart, it had the little ball tip on the spout for a security seal, the one I got on here, amazon, it did not have the little ball tip on the spout for security seal</li>
            <li> It made my skin very dry. My skin is breaking out. Also I developed a dry patch of skin near my chin. Not very much product in the container.</li>
            <li> I need something to repair my skin. After many years of not caring the sun was starting to make me look older than my age. I need to repair and slow down the damage. After shielding my face from the sun and washing my face everyday with a light exfoliating  face wash I would put on a light coat over my face. Friends which have not seen me a long time complement me on my more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the only daily moisturizer that I can use. I&#x27;ve used other brands before, but they all were either too thick for my skin (I am in my mid-30&#x27;s) or would made me break out. I have a combination skin with some fine lines. This cr√®me is ideal because it moisturizes without making my face look greasy. I make sure that I exfoliate before use and voila - perfectly smooth and dewy skin!</li>
            <li> It feels, looks, and smells like regular heavy sunscreen.  If I put it on right after a shower, it still takes half an hour for the greasy appearance that I get with sunscreen to go away.  It also burns a little (I have dry/sensitive skin). It&#x27;s only been one week, so maybe I&#x27;ll notice some amazing effect, but so far, I&#x27;m unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I just tried it recently and saw little red spots on my face. I used other oil olay products and had no problems..so, I will give it a few more try and hopefully it will be fine.</li>
            <li> EVER SINCE I STARTED USING THE OLAY PRODUCTS FROM THE USA I HAVE NO REGRETS I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT IT MAKES MY SKIN LOOK YOUNGER AND SUPPLE AND HYDRATED. THE ONE FROM THE USA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONES FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ALL OLAY. I THANK GOD FOR OLAY USA.</li>
            <li> I always loved Olay products.. This one is exceptional.. The price is right and would recommend it to everyone who loves Olay products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many products.  Was surprised to see the result of this the minute I applied. The texture and radiance look on my skin was noticeable .  I haven&#x27;t experience any rashes or hives yet.  Skin feels supple and moist throughout the day, which it&#x27;s hard on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and I love the way my skin feels and how my makeup goes on over this.  It is not too heavy and it absorbs really well leaving my skin feeling soft and silky and keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  I have not seen a big change with the lines that are already present but I do see it making my skin look more youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this I really like it I use Olay total effects for more than 5 years, this was the first time that I buy this product from amazon, I but I always have this product, is amazing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product made my face incredibly oily so my makeup slides off and the added bonus of two+ weeks of the deep painful acne you get from clogged pores. Thanks Olay, you protected my face from a burn but it was painful anyway. I love being in my late twenties and sporting a twelve year old like acne breakout.</li>
            <li> For daytime use, when you are likely to sweat, it burns my eyes.  For me, it&#x27;s a waste of money and it is going into the stuff graveyard under the sink.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 yearsI think it has helped me look a little younger than I am.</li>
            <li> Great for dry and oily skin. My best friend recommended this product and she has really oily skin, I have dry skin but it&#x27;s the perfect combo. The only reason it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; is because it has sunscreen in it. So it&#x27;s totally fine for any age. It&#x27;s light feeling and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It&#x27;s the ONLY face lotion either of us have ever been able to find that&#x27;s worked, ever. Really great stuff and I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone! I&#x27;ll be using it forever.</li>
            <li> Greasy.  Nothing about this formula stands out enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other moisturizer after using this. it&#x27;s absolutely helped even out my skin tone and from someone who&#x27;s used a million different face moisturizers, this has boded as the best for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved it i&#x27;m definetely going to purchase another again when this one i bought is finished!</li>
            <li> I like the light consistency of this product. It is not greasy and absorbs very fast. This is my 3rd purchase but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any anti-aging results. But most of the creams promise that effect and none hold it. Therefore I&#x27;m just happy with the product and the price and let my wrinkles be wrinkles....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand perfume and its in everything. ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!) This is great for me,doesn&#x27;t take forever to be absorbed. I have it on auto ship. Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too. He&#x27;s had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf 15 is just enough for regular daily use. I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night. The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass. Lets keep it that way!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I am in my late 20s looking for a preventative moisturizer, after a day or two of use my skin has drastically improved! Smoother skin, feels hydrated, pores are smaller, and my makeup glides on smoother than ever. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer I have used in a long time, plus it has other advantages. I have it on subscription now so I never run out. It gives skin a smooth glow.</li>
            <li> Well, I thought I would like this, so I bought two.  Was a mistake.  I typically use the original Olay moisturizer, but needed something with SPF for summer, this broke me out really badly, after one use.  Maybe it&#x27;s the sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t use it. I kept using thinking my skin would get used to it, used most of the bottle with no change.  As far as moisturizer goes, it was great, did the job and you didn&#x27;t have to use much - I have very dry skin and it worked for that purpose.  I switched to Simple and have had no problems with it breaking out my face.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and this product made my skin look really oily about half way through the day. I&#x27;ve stopped using it for that reason. I&#x27;m really surprised that other people didn&#x27;t experience the same thing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:38228751]]The accompanying video compares and contrasts three different Olay face creams:&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;Olay Definity: Correcting protective lotion with SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist: DNA superstructure UV cream SPF 25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:&lt;br /&gt;1. I made an error in the video in describing all three lotions as having an SPF of 15. The Regenerist product actually has an SPF of 25 and the other 2 are SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;2. In the video, I incorrectly noted that 2 of the 3 were sold as anti-aging products when in fact I realized afterwards that all 3 are anti-aging products.&lt;br /&gt;3. The size of all 3 products reviewed was the 1.7 fluid ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4. All 3 products contain a warning to \\&quot;AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES.\\&quot; Given that these are anti-aging products, and I (and I think most women) use them around the eyes, it is a warning worth noting.</li>
            <li> Started using this at a friend&#x27;s recommendation, replacing a product that was about 4 times more expensive.  Some aging spots have significantly faded and the moisturizing effect is even better than the other product from a salon.  We&#x27;ll see how it does with sun protection this summer.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read these reviews before trying this product, though I am not sure it would have made a difference--I probably would still have bought it. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer or sunscreen or even make-up before, but while applying my third application of this I noticed the red rash on my cheeks that others have mentioned. I&#x27;ve used other Oil of Olay products with no incident, and I was actually trying to switch to this from the Neutrogena anti-aging product I had been using simply because of the name brand. Didn&#x27;t work.     Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer. All over disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it every morning. I started using it after I saw my mom using it and my mom skin looks great for her age.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 months now. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know that I notice a change in my skin yet, but we will see how well the SPF works once I am able to spend more time outside now that it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; in Chicago anymore!</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay as sunscreen, but it causes breakouts (acne) for me. Went off it and back on a few times to confirm this product was the culprit, I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts otherwise. For reference, I have fair/dry skin that I usually classify as sensitive and live in a dry hot climate.</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effect&#x27;s facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  It&#x27;s easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve not noticed and issues or breakouts.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now with good results.</li>
            <li> Not at all expecting that.  At first I thought it was a suspicious package and thought about reporting it to the post office.  But then realized it was the cream that I ordered nearly a month ago.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using my face is really smooth and clear, I am 39 years old and I have noticed a big change!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries to a non-sticky soft texture. My skin feels super sorry and I love how it improves my skin condition with constant use and the SPF is a huge bonus since I don&#x27;t like wearing our sunscreen but one has to to prevent premature aging. The price when on sale is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is one of my top two favorite moisturizers.  I do get a little oily with it in the T-zone throughout the day if I don&#x27;t apply it sparingly there, but it does keep my skin smooth and youthful looking.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or have a strong smell.  I have rosacea and the sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I have oily skin with larger than normal pores. This moisturizer always balances my skin year-round. Love that it also has SPF 15. Sometimes you can find it cheaper with coupons and sales in stores, but that&#x27;s few and far between. Amazon always has a great price and with prime, it&#x27;s delivered to your door in 2 days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, and unfortunately the lotion is a little too heavy for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin very well. I just use a teeny tiny bit and that seems to work alright but not as well as other lotions I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since long but purchased first time from Amazon! It&#x27;s exactly as expected....</li>
            <li> It helps a lot with managing my acne. I have one very small fine line that I&#x27;m trying to erase and I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic improvements with that yet. However, it is moisturizing my skin very well and is helping my scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are concern, it does contain Methylparaben, which is NOT proven to be a cancer causing agent. I did my research and some study digging. With all the products that have been taken off the market due to harmful/toxic agents (ie. most AcneFree products), I doubt the CDC would allow parabens to side that easily. In addition, all of the paraben studies were conducted on people who already have cancer and not on people who are healthy.</li>
            <li> My paternal grandmother has always used Olay products and when it was my turn I started using Oil of Olay. As I grew older i realized that my skin needed special treatment to not only control signs of aging, but also not exacerbate my acne. I&#x27;ve use all sorts of moisturizers for my problem skin, but kept coming back to Olay. About fours years ago, I found this product and I absolutely love it. It makes my face feel moisturized, but not oily and works well with my constant battle with acne. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i mix this with Booster C Powder and i&#x27;ve notice a big difference in only two weeks. No foundation Needed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the SPF built in is better than using a separate heavier sunblock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my skin went from acne prone, blackheads, and spots to smooth radiant skin. I use clean and clear morning burst morning and night with the proactive face cleansing brush followed by olay 7 in 1 total effects moisturizer. Once a week I use the 50% lactic peel from perfect image and then once a week I also use the Aztec clay mask as well once a week. My face went from being a mess to smooth, radiant and dare I say perfect.</li>
            <li> convenient and quick way to get necessary household items</li>
            <li> I love OTE. I have been using for a few years now. Works well to moisturize plus spf. Good price on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve achieved great results with this moisturizer, great for the wrinkles around the eyes and on the neck. Cannot go anywhere without first applying and when going on vacation it can be applied under the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> this leaves grit on my face. I don&#x27;t know what it is- but every time after using this I have what feels like sand on my skin-when it dries it kind of wipes/flakes off. doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> okay product, only used a couple of weeks, no visible change yet!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years.  Let you in on a secret... I used to be a makeup and skin specialist for one of the most expensive lines.  This moisturizer has kept my skin supple and I am over 60!  No wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months and it&#x27;s help me that my dry skin gets better.lam satisfy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Total Effects 7-in-1 for 10 years. I love it, but this most recent shipment was either a weird batch or a fake. It was more liquidy and smelled different. I double checked the bottle to see if it was a new formula or something. I googled to see if Olay changed to formula. It&#x27;s suspect.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very greasy.  Does not absorb well at all.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it always, It is a good product and the price is right compared to stores .She is happy and I too !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Feels good, not greasy, protects my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great. I have been looking for a good one with SPF for awhile. I find a lot of moisturizers to be too thick or too greasy. This one is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t roll or make your makeup cake up. I have been using it for a few weeks now and my skin already feels tighter and soooo soft. Love this ! Well worth it . Believe me I am super picky w products and I have tried many high and low end and am very satisfied with this purchase :).</li>
            <li> I gave this lotion a 5 out of 5 star rating for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It moisturizes superbly. The lotion absorbs quickly, leaves no greasiness afterward, and prevents my face from feeling tight afterwards. I&#x27;ve had lotions before that feel great at first, but then leave my skin feeling tight minutes later. That&#x27;s not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s fragrance free. I have sensitive skin, so I love products that a fragrance free. Fragrance free products are less likely to irritate the skin than perfumed ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It has SPF 15 in it! It&#x27;s important to apply SPF every day, even in the summer, and so I do. It&#x27;s nice to not have to apply SPF and lotion separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s an all-in-one product: No need to apply separate serums with this lotion, especially on your busy days. The lotion helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and even pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants to streamline their morning routine and seriously care for their skin should definitely get this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for a couple of years.  Great daytime moisturizing product.  Not at all greasy.  Easily absorbed and does a great job.  With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better!</li>
            <li> This product was amazing until makers changed it ! Now it&#x27;s just ok. I&#x27;m using it because I already bought it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Order for a friend in Brasil. She being using for 2 years and love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, and the skin absorbs it immediately. No scent, which is good, since my nose is delicate to strong smells. This cream is great! I can use it during the day, since it has SPF and during the night as well. The bottle is small, but it lasts a very long time, you only need a bit to cover your whole face. I like the size since I travel a lot,. this way I can carry it with me in my carry on :-)&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it !! I&#x27;m happy I ran into this cream!</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t wear tinted moisturizers at work and this worked well to keep my skin moisturized. It does smell like sunblock because of the spf, but the smell does go away pretty quick. I&#x27;ve been using the cc cream and night cream from olay, and they were both good. Only time will tell if this moisturizer will help. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I started using this to replace another Olay product that ceased production. It is effective, odorless and works great on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and asian...i started trying this product after seeing it in several commercials... i&#x27;ve been on Clinique Dramatically Diff Moisturizer for about 5 years now and at first i thought i&#x27;ll be using it for the rest of my ife.. not until i found this!!    this i can really see the difference in my face and i&#x27;m not even done with my 1st bottle yet!   really really good!</li>
            <li> I have been faithful to olay total effects and my husband is hooked to it too. Just apply and go!  Lately, I have noticed more blemishes popping upand my skin looks dry and lifeliess. I guess it is time to switch!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts. I was looking for something that would prevent aging and reduce the impact of smoking on my skin without causing acne. Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts! Plus, it is SPF 15 so there is some sun protection included.    Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application. The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive, but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.     I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used this only two days before my facial skin swelled up, felt like sandpaper, and turned red.  It feels like an itchy, burning sunburn!  Now I need to go to a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> It might be good to use during summer time. When the weather is so dry in the winter, this one is not enough to keep the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Received in very timely manner. Product recommended to me by dermotolgist because of rosacea. Lasts much longer than anticipated so the automatic mailings should have more selections of timeframes.  Will continue to use and will tell others.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years &amp; purchased it on Amazon for the convenience. Works well for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and keeps my face/neck moisturized and adds a little glow.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face. I am 64 years old. I tried it once and now I have to have it. I love that it comes in unsented because I have alot of allergies.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay for years in the UK. I purchased this product and found the texture of the cream to be very different. It does not give the silky smooth finish Olay cream is renound for. I called the Olay customer service and the told me the address on the back of the bottle is NOT a licenced import so it could well be a fake product. I believe this is a fake product so would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Love the feel of this lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> Felt great to put on, had a slight sunscreen smell at first, but it goes away quickly. Kept my skin feeling nice all day.</li>
            <li> I have very oily and acne prone skin. I started using this in the winters and it moisturized my skin very well. I started noticing a change within the first week itself and I absolutely loved it!! However, as summer came, it started getting too oily for my skin and started causing break-outs. I just wish it were as good for me in the summer and it was in the winter. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It just okay. It does moisturize well, but within a few hours after putting it on, my face was so oily! I have to blot my face to get rid of it. I switched back to my other brand of moisturizer and my skin went back to normal. Darn!</li>
            <li> I swear by this for daily use. I don&#x27;t use anything else in the morning after my daily cleanse besides Olay daily defense when I travel.</li>
            <li> My skin changes through out the seasons. I&#x27;m in Chicago and the winter is brutal where the summers can be scorching. This moisturizer is great for the summers and temperatures where it&#x27;s just hot. It&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunblock in one. The consistency reminds me of Elmer&#x27;s glue when you smear it around so you have to really rub this in and it does leave a milk film on the face.  That film eventually absorbs.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and I&#x27;m happy with it. I will continue to use it unless I find something I like better</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product on March 4th and received it today. I purchased this product for..well the obvious, but mostly because I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C (in the form of Ascorbic Acid) and/or Antioxidants. The most effective Vitamin C in cosmetic products is Asorbic Acid. I see on the ingredients list that the other form of vitamin C, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is still present but the Ascorbic Acid has been completely removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude 2 things. 1. Olay is producing a new formula. 2. Amazon sold me a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event that Olay his producing a new formula, Amazon needs to update the photos of the product on this page. The photo lists ascorbic acid as one of the ingredients as well as PEG-4 Laurate and PEG-4 Dilaurate, both of which are missing from what I have in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may want to return this. As aforementioned, I purchased this primarily because it is a sunscreen moisturizer WITH Vitamin C  (Ascorbic Acid). Although I noticed Vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate) and Vtiamin B (Niacinamide and Panthenol) are still ingredients I question too if the antioxidants are still present at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am traveling to the nearest drug store to see if they carry this product and inspect the packaging to compare/contrast.</li>
            <li> this is a great moisteriser! it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy I didn&#x27;t break out from it and it really does work will always continue to use Olay products</li>
            <li> I like UV 15 because it protect my skin and make my face white ,&lt;br /&gt;but titanium oxid it has causes my face burn and it take 2 week to get use to it</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, only need a little for each use.  I like that this product is on the safe to use list according to Environmental Working Group guide to safe cosmetics.  That is why I bought it.  We must be proactive in investigating all the products we put into and on our body.  There is a lot of stuff out there that causes cancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference in my skin but I still use it.  the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.  smells like sunscreen and I&#x27;m not a fan of that</li>
            <li> Thick and Creamy.  Has SPF.  I have very sensitive combination skin.  This product has not caused one break out!  I did notice a difference (a good one) after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Glad I found the moisturizer with SPF 15 since I&#x27;m outside with my horse a lot.  Not heavily perfumed, for which I am thankful.  Feels great on.  It hasn&#x27;t made me look 30, but people do comment that I don&#x27;t look my age, so maybe it&#x27;s due to this moisturizer.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This olay daily moisturizer is very natural looking and perfect underneath make-up. I&#x27;d only wish it could have higher UV protection, at least +50. It is fragrance free, i am very allergic and it has worked awesome. Also price in amazon has been cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed by this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t absorb and leaves white residue on my skin. The more I try to rub it in, the more it clumps up into little white bits all over my face. (It&#x27;s definitely the moisturizer and not dry skin) It&#x27;s also meant to be fragrance free but it smells like a chemical factory. It&#x27;s such a strong unpleasant smell so it&#x27;s going in the bin.</li>
            <li> I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good value.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great.  It keeps my skin feeling young for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the day, night, and new feather-weight day, fragrance-free versions of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the standard day and night does not provoke breakouts, I&#x27;ve found the featherweight version does, so I stopped using it. I&#x27;ve been sticking with just the fragrance free day and night version of this product, and I have to say while I love the one intended for night (hydrates well, doesn&#x27;t promote my acne issues, doesn&#x27;t leave me patchy dry with my combination winter skin), the day does not play well with my other products - namely any foundations or tinted BB/CC. The 15spf Olay Total Effects causes anything I apply to my face - makeup wise - to pill and flake. Terribly disappointed - would have given it a single star, but the night cream deserved mercy. Gonna use up what I have on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup, find another day moisturizer that I can wear with my makeup, and stick to just buying the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - night cream is better than the day and provides hydration without provoking acne/redness. Creamy, light, true to being fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - spf versions do not play well with makeups foundations or tinted creams of any kind that I have found; causes pilling and flaking. The size/cost. Honestly the price-point for what you get is comparable to other similar products promising to cater to aging skin issues. They are all pretty much tiny little bottles that cost a pretty penny. In this case, the night is worth it, day not so much.</li>
            <li> Great price! Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and already see results.  The dreaded \\&quot;11\\&quot; between my brows is slowly starting to go away.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m 40 and started noticing some fine lines/wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows. I started using this and the lines between my eyebrows are 90% less noticeable. And my forehead lines seem better too. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just opened my new box of Olay Total Effects--it DOES NOT contain sunscreen! I always use Total Effects fragrance free with SPF. This bottle did not say anything on it about sunscreen (my others always have) However a  small label had been placed on the bottle claiming it contained sunscreen .I checked the ingredients &amp; they are NOT  the same -no sunscreen!!!!!  HOW DECEPTIVE !!!!!</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick at first, but now I love the creamy feeling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this on subscribe and save for quite some time and have always been happy.  This time the bottle pump is defective and the moisturizer is thick and gummy, not the same product I&#x27;m used to at all.  I&#x27;m cancelling my Amazon subscribe and save order and will buy the product elsewhere.  I almost wonder if this isn&#x27;t a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> feels like there is some grains when you apply it. my face gets greasy throughout the day. i guess it still protects my face from the sun but i developed few spots on my forehead though after using it few weeks now. maybe didn&#x27;t work well for me.. we all have different skin types. I still love Olay products though will try other ones next time, i guess oil free is best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one.  The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated.  I stopped using it after two weeks, hoping that this was just a phase of the product I would have to endure, but alas, my skin just got worse.  I went back to my Aveeno lotion, and my skin calmed down after a few days.  I will never buy this product again, it was so uncomfortable having itchy skin on my face, knowing that were I to scratch it, I would only make it worse.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this daily moisturizer. It smells so good I wish I could use it all over. It leaves my face very soft and with a nice natural glow. My skin has actually improved since I started using it about 3 weeks ago. I will most definitely keep buying. Its awesome!</li>
            <li> This product irritated my skin so bad I had to quit using it, it was so painful.&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior citizen, 77 years old, and my skin is thin, sensitive, and bruises easy.  This may be the reason.  It may not bother younger skin.</li>
            <li> A little to greasy for me. I like a lighter cream so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face. Will try something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay Total Effects fragrance free for many years. It is the best moisturizer for the money in my opinion. Amazon&#x27;s price is very competitive so that&#x27;s why I get it through subscription.</li>
            <li> I like it but it does feel extra thick, likely due to the sunscreen. It can feel more like sunscreen than lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it not only helps keep my skin feeling smoother, it isn&#x27;t greasy but feels nice going on and provides a touch of foundation as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Olay but this is one of my favorite products from them. Leaves skin soft and beautiful. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I like the Olay total effects. I buy two of them. One for my friend, another for myself. We all like it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, I&#x27;ve really liked it! I have oily skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t make my face break out at all, feels like  sheer.</li>
            <li> I love my Olay products. This moisturizer goes on great, isn&#x27;t greasy and has an SPF which we ladies should use daily. The pump is nice because it helps prevent pouring out too much at once. Using this along with my other Olay products leaves my skin soft, tighter and protected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for normal to oily skin and has SPF 15 in it :) but wash your hands before you touch your eyeliner brush it really stings if it gets in your eyes, a lot of moisturizers in the past haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the subtle fragrance and the smooth creaminess of this product.  It blends in efforlessly and makes my face feel moisturized and smooth.  I have not noticed fewer wrinkles, but have not used it longer than a week so far.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite moisturizer in years.  I definitely foresee this being a regular purchase in the future. I may even take advantage of the subscription service.</li>
            <li> really like it for my face</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I am very new to a skin care regimen.  I started up recently because now that I&#x27;m in law school, I feel I should...because the other women are doing it.  I have always had a young face but apparently there is always room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this the day after I received it.  I am using it this in the morning following my Olay recommended regimen.  They are:&lt;br /&gt;Olay Pro-X&lt;br /&gt;Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System (twice a week for microdermabrasion, twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days, once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days)&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser Skin Care (twice a day)&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Treatment (twice a day)&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment (at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save because, well, 15% off isn&#x27;t bad.  I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer, they saw results in two weeks, this that and the other.  I have seen no results from this.  After the night treatment at least I can say I like the way my face feels.  This makes my skin feel oily, makes me extremely shiny, and has caused me to break out.  I am giving it 1 star for the sunscreen since, well, it&#x27;s sunscreen and I can&#x27;t complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school.  I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I&#x27;m going to try to go after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount is 3 months, I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this.  There&#x27;s not very much in this container and unless you&#x27;re up to smooshing your face, it does not go very far.  I am reducing this another star because I hate the way that it dispenses.  I never know how much I&#x27;m going to get per pump so I have to watch it and go slow.  Even though I use the same amount every day, I usebetween 1 and 8 pumps due to the erratic nature of the delivery system.  I also know that toward the end of this, there&#x27;s going to be some left in the bottom that I&#x27;ll never be able to access or use.  This wouldn&#x27;t bother me except that I do like the way the other creams are just in a jar and I can take or leave whatever I need.  My guess this delivery system is because of the sunscreen, since that has to be in a light-proof container to prevent a reaction.  I am reducing this one last star because every time I use it, I break out.  While I certainly can&#x27;t fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day, I cannot in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions.  I put it on once in the morning and I am oily all day.  I thought that this would go down as my skin became used to it but I was admittedly wrong.  I did not start out by doing the every two hours when I realized how deep this did not go.  Many days I have to blot it off.  I know what you&#x27;re thinking--&amp;#34;Oh, that&#x27;s your makeup!&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  I really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face.  Don&#x27;t want, don&#x27;t like.  I honestly am only two weeks into the regimen but for that last reason alone, I can&#x27;t do it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 13 years and my skin looks great!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles.  I am 36.  My younger sister has more wrinkles than I do.  I use Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream at night and would highly recommend you use the two products together.  They are a good value compared to the department store brands.  I have tried switching to other products along the way and have always regretted it (L&#x27;Oreal, Alba).  Within 3 months, I got so many wrinkles.  It took me 6 more months after switching back to erase those other wrinkles.  I think Neutrogena and Roc products are ok.  I have used those, too, because I&#x27;ve always read that derm&#x27;s reco retinol at night.  They do work but I feel like Olay takes care of more than just wrinkles.  It makes my whole face all one shade and controls sagging and just makes me look radiant.  When I stop using this product, I start to look haggard within a week.  I have tried the Olay Pro-X line and it didn&#x27;t work that well for me for some reason.  That&#x27;s fine because I don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> This was really, really heavy for my face.  It felt like wearing a mask.  I in turn gave it to my mother who really likes it, though.  So, all&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> I think I would not buy it again because I did not fell in love with it like I thought I was going to.</li>
            <li> The product becomes &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and peels off by the end of the day.  And I didn&#x27;t notice that the SPF is only 15.</li>
            <li> Instead of spending a lot more for the higher name brands my wife uses this and feels it works well for her; especially for the price.  Her words, &amp;#34;It isn&#x27;t too much moisture, and it absorbs quickly enough for my makeup application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, wish it had more firming properties</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Great buy for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over 4 months, and like the results.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am Lesley McKee, not Charles.  Secondly I meant to order the Oil of Olay Total Effects product that contained a tinted concealer.  The containers are identical and I inadvertently ordered the wrong one.  My mistake, but now I am stuck with two containers that I can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would much prefer to go to a retail shop to purchase this item, but none in my area carry the tinted variety.  I have switched brands so that I don&#x27;t make the same mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesley McKee</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews for this product and added it to my subscribe and save list.  Once the product came in, I was so excited to begin using it.  I had hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t smell or feel like sunscreen, but both of my concerns were real - this product looks, smells and feels like sunscreen.  Worse, the product gave me acne and I did not have acne concerns before trying this product.  I cancelled my subscription and wish that I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Great price in Amazon.  I have been using this as my main moisturizer for a few years.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a big fan for anything Olay....she loved it.....Olay products are the only skin care products she uses.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel. I have noticed a definitely change and smoothness. I also have the night cream too!</li>
            <li> I use these products all the time, and can&#x27;t shop at stores anymore so on line shopping is just what the Dr, ordered</li>
            <li> Olay has been around for quite a while, like me. It is a reliable product and really not very expensive.</li>
            <li> i will totally recommend this product. the product is not too thick nor too light. it does not make my skin breakout</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the SPF is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Works great and is a quality product.  I have enjoyed using it&lt;br /&gt;and it has nourished my skin. I love that it is unscented! I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;scented facial moisturizer and this product delivers.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer for the price and ingredients.  I like the fact it has the SPF 15, no oil, and thank goodness no fragrance.  Use this as my a.m. moisturizer and then apply Bare Minerals powder foundation.  This moisturizer works better than most with the Bare Minerals.  Time will tell if it continues to perform as it has now.</li>
            <li> I liked this product as it worked at the time, but it contains alcohol and I don&#x27;t like to put alcohol on my face</li>
            <li> It smells very strongly like sun lotion. Causes me to get a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging UV Moisturizer SPF 15 is my everyday moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for the last 10 years or so.  It is really light and not greasy at all, and the SPF 15 was what sealed the deal for me since I live in California.  The sun gets scorching hot so any SPF helps.  I have super sensitive skin so I break out very easily.  This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used where I my face did not break out, itch, or turn red.  Would definitely recommend to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It really make my skin very smooth. I immediately see the difference. But it is little pricy for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Very fancy bottle, when you pump it out comes that thick, greasy, white sunscreen everyone has run into before. Maybe it has crazy good ingredients or is good for your skin, but I will never come to enjoy putting thick, greasy feeling, white sunscreen on my face or body. I do use it, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while, this is not my first purchase, &amp; I like it. Good for those of us over 35.</li>
            <li> Yep you guessed it, Olay total affects is the reason she swears by it. She also recommends it to all who ask, and it makes her happy as well. Get some.</li>
            <li> This is more of a sunscreen than a lotion. It was not what I was looking for and it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least about 5 years. I works well to me! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily but fresh looking skin. Truly love this!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, silky and rich but doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I am afan of olay 7in 1. it is perfect for my combination/dry skin. and it is non-greasy. and the spf is a plus.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin. I have very dry skin and need a thick moisturizer for winter. My face feels awesome.</li>
            <li> GREAT lotion. Being using it for years. Great value for the price. Got it cheaper from this seller. Bought 2 bottles for a great price.</li>
            <li> Product is the best of the best. Endorsed by the cosmetics cop, Paula Begoun. Have used this product for two years. Offers sun protection, stellar ingredients and the added bonus of fragrance free. If purchased in bricks in motar would have paid double price as I ordered two.</li>
            <li> People comment on how my skin has a glow--it has helped greatly the reddness on my noses/ckeeks.  It seems to have a tightening effect too. Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I wish i could rate this higher.  It has effective amounts of niacinamide (a really potent cell communicating anti ager) and sunscreen, and no scent which is a plus.  Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned out to be a problem for me.  I can&#x27;t tolerate the stabilized chemical sunscreen, it makes my skin burn and causes hives, which I guess is quite common.  It was otherwise an excellent product with a nice texture, moisturized perfectly without being too heavy to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been using it for several years.  I particularly like the unscented version with UV protection.  I can moisturize my face and apply sunscreen in one easy step.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over three years. It really is my favorite lotion. Every time I try to switch I end up regretting it. Always leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but never greasy. The SPF factor is a bonus and I always get the fragrance-free. You will love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because in my country is not marketed. I am happy so far with the presentation and texture of the cream. Can use under make-up without problem.   Recommend it widely, especially for women in their thirties!</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects with SPF 15 used to be my and my daughter&#x27;s favorite daily moisturizer.  We are both very fair and have very sensitive skin.  Almost all sunscreens cause breakouts.  Almost all moisturizers make us break out.  Olay with sunscreen was amazing; no irritation...sunscreen...a dream come true.  Then it disappeared from the market!  What?????  We were heartbroken.  We found some here and there and stocked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when I was shopping for the non-sunscreen version on Amazon (since that&#x27;s what we were forced to buy!), I noticed that the SPF 15 was available once again!  Hallelujah!!  Ordered it right away with the automatic refill option.  And immediately we noticed that our faces started to break out.  Was it hormones?  Had I changed something in my routine?  I asked my daughter if she noticed any changes.  We came to the sad conclusion that our much anticipated new version of Total Effects with SPF 15 was FAIL!!!  Olay are you listening????  Change the formula BACK!!! PLEASE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...if your skin is sensitive; this is not the sunscreened-lotion for you.  The regular version without sunscreen is still a pretty darned good lotion.  I cannot wear regular Oil of Olay stuff; makes me have allergic break-outs like a sun-of-a-gun, but Total Effects is worth a try if you&#x27;ve had problems with other lines.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months every morning until I recently finished it. It did a very good job at moisturising my skin and it was very easy to apply, with the special push-cap. (The only downside of that is that you cannot anticipate when the cream is over.) I did not notice any big wrinkle improvement. I think it helped with the fine lines (I am 35 years old, normal to mixed skin). I used it as face sun protection as well during my two beach vacations and it helped. I did not get any sun burn on my face. It did not help, however, with the few older sun spots that I have. So I need to get something more targeted to deal with that.</li>
            <li> great product‚Ä¶ unless you get a bad batch. the ones i&#x27;ve previously ordered worked really well. the one that i ordered last left welts and burned my skin so badly. i&#x27;d try it again because i really like the product when it works and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(the reviews was at 666 count. i couldn&#x27;t stand it that&#x27;s mainly the reason for the review! :-D)</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ve switched their formula. Used to give a nice cool feeling when applied now that&#x27;s gone and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go into the skin like it used to just sits on top in kind of a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all women that are looking for a day moisturizer, I have tried all brands from Chanel, Lanc√¥me, Dior, ect, and I found that this product is the most effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know how to review this. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and while i haven&#x27;t noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer. I decided on this product based on the review at beautypedia.com, it seems to be a reliable product. It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don&#x27;t need to use too much. It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion, but I don&#x27;t mind. I like the pump design, and if you have read up on moisturizers you might have heard that you shouldn&#x27;t use any product in a jar because it is constantly being exposed to air and bacteria. The packaging, spf, and anti aging aspects are unbeatable at this price (mine was $14 on Amazon at the time).</li>
            <li> Love! Ive been using olay products for years and Im still in my 20s. Neva too early to take precautions lol</li>
            <li> Ordered Olay 7-1 Anti aging as a previous in store buyer. First time online &amp; w SPF.  Limited search results, only Amazon had it. I&#x27;m only 23 w dry,clear skin. Only product (even out of derm prescribed) to get rid of seasonal fungal rash on face almost instantly, it actually prevented it from reoccurring as freq. Love product, although it&#x27;s the only non-Vegan item I use, wish Olay would change that! Seller however, took maximum shipping time allotted and the box looked like the Grinch handled it once it got to my house. Obviously I&#x27;m aware the actual seller didn&#x27;t personally deliver it, but maybe they should be more involved/conscientious of how their packing and shipping services handle their products!</li>
            <li> tip did not have seal cap, product felt almost like an empty bottle, as soon as i put it on my face it felt like a thick sludge, not comfortable at all and the next day i woke up my skin looked damaged from the product. threw it away after first use would not recommend to anyone. do not buy this product it is a fake and a bad one at that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but not anything outstanding. I like that it has SPF so I don&#x27;t have to apply a separate sun screen. I have not made a repeat purchase because I wanted to try other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Total Effects for over 10 years.  I use it in the morning and at night.  I&#x27;m 67 years young but have passed for, between 48 and 52, my daughter is 47.  It does make a difference. Also as you use it do some facial exercises, and smile.</li>
            <li> In my earlier years, I never used moisturizers because they were so heavy and I had oily skin, so I would break out. But as I aged, I started to use Olay Total Effects, I purchased at Costco - loved it, it was lightweight, and I did not break out, and I went on to use it for years.  The last time I purchased it at Costco I noticed it said SPF 15, but assumed it would be the same - it is NOT.  It is much heavier feeling on my skin, not lightweight like the original, my eyes burn and tear after applying it (which makes my mascara run all over), because they don&#x27;t stop tearing, and lastly I&#x27;m breaking out like a teenager, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s - haven&#x27;t broken out like this in years.  I HATE THIS MOISTURIZER!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and does not irritate my eyes like other facial creams</li>
            <li> I started using this when I was pregnant and noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t responding well to my normal foundation and was extremely dry.  Almost a year later, I still use it and my skin looks and feels great.  I&#x27;m 27 so I don&#x27;t think it necessary looks younger but hopefully will keep it looking this way for a long time to come.  The &amp;#34;Touch of Foundation&amp;#34; is very sheer so if you feel you need a lot of coverage, this isn&#x27;t going to cut it.  I also found that applied with your fingers makes it less so than if you use a sponge (better for your skin anyway).</li>
            <li> Excellent Product 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I think I am liking this product. I say I think because currently I am not really experiencing much of a difference yet, but it is still early in my use of it and it is starting out better than my other facial cream experiments have been thus far. I am a redhead with very sensitive skin, and most moisturizers either look really greasy and turn my face red with irritation, or just absorb and leave my skin dry with no real improvement. This moisturizer feels great, and I do love the \\&quot;scent free\\&quot; because it kind of smells like sunscreen (SPF 15 in it) which I love because psychologically it makes me feel like I am on vacation :) The only thing I do not like about this product is that I typically wash my face, apply moisturizer, put on my makeup, and head off to work in the morning. The moisturizer does take a bit long to sink into my skin so I have to wait and kill time before I do my makeup which is a bummer when I am in a hurry, but it probably just means it is more moisturizing of a cream in general.</li>
            <li> I really like the Olay moisturizers, they work very well for the fine lines and is not greasy like some. I recommend this for anyone that wants a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. I love having the bonus UV protection. It helps my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I saw it recommended on another website as a best choice for facial moisturizer. I was pretty impressed as it seemed to address all my needs. I used it for many months with no issues. If I had one complaint it would be that the lotion was a little thick. I imagine that has something to do with the sunscreen. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 years now and I love it. The SPF works very well (I am very fair skinned and burn easily) -- it has prevented a lot of sun damage. I like how it feels (lightweight) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a general moisturizer to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> protects skin, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this everyday face/neck cream. I have used it for years and it has never let me down. Having combination skin that changes season to season is so hard, and what I like about total effects is that it&#x27;s an all around cream that offer moisture/SPF protection. If you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin and want a nice glow throughout the day I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> Good product but the price is not as competitive as other sites. Being a loyal user of Olay, I give this purchase 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This package arrived early, and was well protected inside the box.  So far, Olay has helped me completely turn my skin around.  :)</li>
            <li> So disappointed. Very thick and sticky consistency. Way too heavy caused breakouts after one use. Also not for sensitive skin caused redness.</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer very creamy but not greasy.  It felt so good and makes me feel safe that it has SPF 15</li>
            <li> I shiver at the thought, remembering when I last used this product. I have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t think that this product would effect it since everyone said how \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; Olay products are. First day I used it I didn&#x27;t think much of it only that it&#x27;s pretty thick and greasy feeling. Used it again the next day and by about the third day I had completely broken out in a rash and acne! It was so bad, I discontinued the use but it took couple weeks for my skin to return back to normal. At the time I was in my late 20s and I don&#x27;t even break out, but this stuff made me look like a teenager in puberty! So if you have sensitive skin, or you think you might have sensitive skin I would NOT recommend it. Instead I would highly recommend Garnier Ultra-Lift, it&#x27;s light, and does not irritate or make you skin break out. Plus it WORKS unlike anything else out there and gives our skin a glow, even under makeup. Plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles! :)</li>
            <li> I saw instant results in my complexion when I used it BUT... After using it for a while my skin has become very oily... To the point of embarrassment!  I even bought some oil control powder to try to control it, but that doesn&#x27;t work very well... I did love it and my complexion is still great from using it, I just HATE the oily skin!!! I&#x27;m going to have to pass on this one darn it :(</li>
            <li> silky texture and fragrance-free. packaging with pump will keep the ingredients stable during use. olay always provides good products with good prices.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true . . . and it was.  Both jars that I ordered came without the tab closure.  They were each only  one fourth full.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is PERFECT for me during the summer/spring/fall! It is not oily at all, has spf in it, and is very moisturizing! It doesn&#x27;t make your skin or hands greasy, which is great for me, as I have oily skin. However, in the winter, my skin does tend to dry out and I do find that I need something a bit heavier, so I use the night cream. For most days though, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Love purchasing Olay products with Amazon.  Great products at a great price.</li>
            <li> spf makes it smell not so good and doesn&#x27;t go on as nice a the one without spf</li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite moisturizer. Use with a vitamin C serum like TruSkins naturals best Vitamin C serum and it will work wonders pretty fast. I saw some pretty significant results on my laugh lines and blotchy skin within a week or so. My skin looked nice than it ever has. As a disclaimer though: this moisturizer does not work as well if you don&#x27;t use a serum like the vitamin C serum. Either way, it&#x27;s a really great product, love the SPF in it also. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I live in northern New England, and have sensitive combination skin.  At 36, I know I need a moisturizer, so I would like to maximize my time with a combo product.  I really like serums, so anything that purports to do what a serum does and more (antioxidants, brightening, even skin tone)  I bit.  Unfortunately, my pump feature broke, and my product comes out the side!  Lol, I am still using it, but what a flaw in design!  Also, I have not seen any evening, brightening features, but is a good decent moisturizer.  I use it at least daily, but maybe it should be used 2 times a day for maximum results.</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects is a must for me. It makes my face feel absolutely wonderful. Lots of times, I just go without any make up because I don&#x27;t think I need to after using Total Effects. It feels great and smells just as great, too. I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF.  I&#x27;ve been using Ole Henricksen&#x27;s \\&quot;truth revealed super creme SPF 15\\&quot;, which is $55 a jar.  Well, you definitely get what you pay for.  The smell of this \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; cream is so chemically (is that a word?) and sunscreeny, that it&#x27;s almost unbearable to wear.  It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn&#x27;t fully absorbed by my skin.  My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell (I don&#x27;t want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation).  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I do like this moisturizer, but I am giving it only 3 stars because of the packaging. My bottle, which I purchased at Walmart, stopped pumping after a while, so I figured it was empty. But, being the frugal person I am, I decided to pry open the bottle top, I removed all the pieces, and I discovered the bottle was full of lotion. The pump &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; was only about 1/2&amp;#34; long, and it didn&#x27;t come close to reaching the bottom of the bottle. I would have thrown away a lot of product, so I am just suggesting that, if you do use this lotion, do not throw it away when the pump stops working. It is not difficult to pry open the top and use a Q-tip to get to the rest of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like oil of olay products, this one is light weight, doesnt cause skin irritation, doesnt have a strong smell and it absorbs quickly. I like to repurchase this constantly and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out.  The description says it&#x27;s unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It&#x27;s not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with lots of extra benefits - SPF 15. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fragrance to cause allergies and isn&#x27;t greasy. All Olay&#x27;s products are good - especially for the price as compared to others.</li>
            <li> okay as face lotions go</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Makes my skin look and feel terrific</li>
            <li> Todo bien empacado lo que permitio que llegara en muy buenas condiciones, la pieza es tal cual como lo indica las imagenes.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does an okay job, but for the price, its not conquering any major skin issues.  I expected more, and won&#x27;t be spending so much again.  It was a nice treat, but the regular Oil of Olay daily moisturizer (about $8) does just as well.</li>
            <li> I have recently gone through 3 moisturizers trying them and returning them. I tried the maybelline tinted BB cream, didn&#x27;t like it, felt like my skin was more dry wearing it or something. Tried No7 tinted moisturizer, got the lightest shade that didn&#x27;t match my skin. It made me look orange kind of. Then I tried No7 day cream...I loved it but the scent was way to strong. Smelled like I sprayed perfume on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here we are, I tried the Olay today and so far so good. Its not greasy, I used just a little and that was plenty. Feels light on my skin and I got the fragrance free one and there is no scent. Just the very very ever so faint smell of sunscreen which I like anyways. So far this is great and I look forward to using it more! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great for my wife.</li>
            <li> Used Olay for more than 40 years and switched to Clinique.  Almost 60 now and returned to Olay!  Was not getting enough moisture from Clinique.  And, it does smooth out the wrinkles.  !hooray  For Olay!</li>
            <li> Excellent product great seller thank you</li>
            <li> Easy all in one !&lt;br /&gt;makes Soft and bright skin</li>
            <li> Ok. Not such a great product.  Big bottle for the amount.</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturier!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. I use it every morning after I get out of the shower. When I used other face creams they would make my face super greasy or not enough and my skin tended to be dry. This product is perfect for me! Leaves my skin feeling really soft healthy looking. Now as for the anti aging effects for this I am not sure. I am only 27 and don&#x27;t have many problem areas, but my thoughts are I should start before there are problem areas right? On average this size container lasts me about 6-7 months. Using only about a pea size amount once daily. Try it!</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; great product I use it day &amp; night</li>
            <li> This is a good line and product.  I use this every morning, the total affects night firming cream at night and the regenerist serum 3x per week.  In the past 3 months have seen major reduction in deep forehead wrinkles.</li>
