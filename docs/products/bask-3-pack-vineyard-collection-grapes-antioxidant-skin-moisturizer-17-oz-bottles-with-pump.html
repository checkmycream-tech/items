            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I had to have MORE....</li>
            <li>The first day I used this, my fiance&#x27; asked what smelled so good. .</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see 3 of the 17 oz bottles for just under $27 bucks!</li>
            <li>It is smooth, no greasy, smells wonderful, but has parabens in it...  look them up if you are curious.. :)</li>
            <li>Loved this product so much.</li>
            <li>Besides loving the scent, the product goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not greasy, like some moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice on your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky on hot days.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say this lotion is non-greasy, absorbs pretty fast and keeps your skin moisturized for some time after applying.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild but lovely and lasts allllll day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; light, skins feels silky smooth without ever feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>A great item for a terrific price.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so light that you can still wear a perfume and not have it conflict.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and has a light grape fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nicely wrapped and VERY well packaged...</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but isn&#x27;t as natural as it appears...</li>
            <li>This product smells good and leaves your skin soft  and supple.</li>
            <li>I love its light, sweet scent that&#x27;s not cloying, and the way it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, I am always interested in a lotion that keeps in moisture for awhile after applying.</li>
            <li>First found this lotion at a winery and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful fragrance and does what is expected - moisturizing your body.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, fresh and clean plus it soaks right into your skin and makes you feel luxurious and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick delivery</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well, esp.</li>
            <li>and I would not trade it for any thing I believe in it that much!!</li>
            <li>The grape smell (which is very nice) fades pretty fast, but this is a terrific lotion.</li>
            <li>The whole line is GREAT,The price is right and it came with free delivery..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and beautifully presentation as each lotion was enclosed in a black mesh bag.  </li>
            <li>It gets right into your skin and (for me personally)doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right there standing in the nail salon.</li>
            <li>My husband used it on his face and hands right after I got it</li>
            <li>A friend first gave this to me as a gift</li>
            <li>When I took the tape off the pretty labels came off and now they look like junk.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth as well.  </li>
            <li>We love the purple color of the bottle as it is one of the Mardi Gras colors (purple, yellow and green).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was soooo glad to finally get this!  </li>
            <li>I first learned of this product at my nail salon.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this first at a winery while on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I know think I am crazy about the paraben avoidance, because it is a nice cream that smells INSANELY good.</li>
            <li>Product arrived exactly as described and with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The company that actually sent it to me, Sunless Deals, got it to me very quickly, even during the holiday shipping season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Products arrived quickly and packed professionally.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper online.</li>
            <li>I just could not see paying that much, so I took a pic of the label &amp; searched Amazon on my mobile.</li>
            <li>very grapy...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like that it is scented</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Definately gets rid of dry skin and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>And I use them all,low end to high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend both the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watessa</li>
            <li>I have only used it on my arms and hands so far, but I plan on using it as a full body moisturizer soon.</li>
            <li>fan from New Orleans</li>
            <li>how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle about 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t used any other skin moisturizer since.</li>
            <li>It is also a natural product, the only type I would use on my body.</li>
            <li>Unlike the green grape version, this one is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Usually the ones that do this are super greasy.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, however the climate I live in is arid, so I do need a moisturizer for my skin.</li>

            <li> Love the scent, fresh and clean plus it soaks right into your skin and makes you feel luxurious and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> quick delivery</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well, esp.</li>
            <li> and I would not trade it for any thing I believe in it that much!!</li>
            <li> The grape smell (which is very nice) fades pretty fast, but this is a terrific lotion.</li>
            <li> The whole line is GREAT,The price is right and it came with free delivery..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and beautifully presentation as each lotion was enclosed in a black mesh bag.  </li>
            <li> It gets right into your skin and (for me personally)doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right there standing in the nail salon.</li>
            <li> My husband used it on his face and hands right after I got it</li>
            <li> A friend first gave this to me as a gift</li>
            <li> When I took the tape off the pretty labels came off and now they look like junk.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth as well.  </li>
            <li> We love the purple color of the bottle as it is one of the Mardi Gras colors (purple, yellow and green).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was soooo glad to finally get this!  </li>
            <li> I first learned of this product at my nail salon.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this first at a winery while on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I know think I am crazy about the paraben avoidance, because it is a nice cream that smells INSANELY good.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described and with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The company that actually sent it to me, Sunless Deals, got it to me very quickly, even during the holiday shipping season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Products arrived quickly and packed professionally.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> I just could not see paying that much, so I took a pic of the label &amp; searched Amazon on my mobile.</li>
            <li> very grapy...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like that it is scented</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Definately gets rid of dry skin and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> And I use them all,low end to high.</li>
            <li> highly recommend both the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watessa</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my arms and hands so far, but I plan on using it as a full body moisturizer soon.</li>
            <li> fan from New Orleans</li>
            <li> how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle about 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t used any other skin moisturizer since.</li>
            <li> It is also a natural product, the only type I would use on my body.</li>
            <li> Unlike the green grape version, this one is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Usually the ones that do this are super greasy.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, however the climate I live in is arid, so I do need a moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on is a thin layer that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> in this snowmaggedon of a winter we&#x27;ve been having when my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> and he loves it too...smells slightly girly, but hey, I am the one smelling it</li>
            <li> Following serious illness my skin resembled &amp;#34;snake skin&amp;#34;, I used my Grapes and voila</li>
            <li> If you are accustomed to a heavy greasy, feel after applying body lotion this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> She got it for me a few years ago</li>
            <li> Found this supplier and it was $ LESS per bottle than I paid at the winery!  </li>
            <li> Too bad I couldn&#x27;t give her the whole pack of 3!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item before at a local winery but was unable to get anymore of it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in the past</li>
            <li> And for the past 3 years she had given it to me for Christmas except this year</li>
            <li> I ordered online since the hair supply place I usually get from (via my hair stylist)</li>
            <li> I usually buy every year and give as xmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> I can still get the small purse size for &#x27;purses&#x27; or stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> She was so disappointed when she could not find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lotions, from Victoria&#x27; Secret to Suave.</li>
            <li> Their pumps were broken off and lotion had leaked out into the bag.</li>
            <li> Two of the three pumps are broken, not happy at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I expected, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First found this lotion at a winery and fell in love with the smell. so much cheaper online. this product smell so wonderful and feels wonderful on your skin as well. doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky just moisturized.</li>
            <li> This moinsturizer is terrific. It has a wonderful fragrance and is a great value. The pump container makes this moisturizer very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described and with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle of this on my bathroom vanity and everyone who uses it always comments about how good it feels and how nice it smells. I bought my first bottle about 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t used any other skin moisturizer since.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift.  It is one of the best gifts that I have ever received.  Smells wonderful and absorbs into skin just great.  The best part is that I have a scar on my neck that I had just resigned myself to.  I began using the VC Grapes lotion and my neck became more youthful looking and the scar was minimized.  A great item for a terrific price.</li>
            <li> This product GRAPES was in my suite in Vegas. I haven&amp;#34;t been without it since. The smell is fantastic the ingredients are wonderful and it is perfectly creamy leaving my skin wonderfully soft all day. The whole line is GREAT,The price is right and it came with free delivery..How good does it get..A must try :-)</li>
            <li> This hand cream smells delicious. Can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t a person who is concerned about parabens, the lotion has very nice texture, feels silky, but not greasy, and smells INSANELY good. That is why I bought it even though I don&#x27;t like the parabens. I would definately purchase for gifts for people I know think I am crazy about the paraben avoidance, because it is a nice cream that smells INSANELY good. I can&#x27;t use it...but for that one bottle...it smelled sooooo good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lotions, from Victoria&#x27; Secret to Suave. I have found that this lotion is the best. It gets right into your skin and (for me personally)doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. Unlike the green grape version, this one is easily absorbed. I put it on before bed every night and I have super-soft skin all the time. The smell is intoxicating yet not overpowering. It&#x27;s really a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and beautifully presentation as each lotion was enclosed in a black mesh bag.  Perfect for holiday gifts and love the very light scent.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling greasy as so many do.  Used it the 1st time int eh nail salon, now I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product.  I bought it for a gift but have used this also.  My sister loves it.</li>
            <li> A friend first gave this to me as a gift and I fell in love with it. It has become my staple moisturizer. The smell is \\&quot;yummy\\&quot; and not overpowering as some can be.It also makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth.I even use this on my two daughters ages 5 and 2. I would definately recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Products came taped together. When I took the tape off the pretty labels came off and now they look like junk. I was giving these as gifts. Also one of the bottles was cracked and lotion was leaking out.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand creams I&#x27;ve ever tried! And I use them all,low end to high.It You feel the difference immediately! It smells great and feels fantastic.I&#x27;m planning on oredering the body wash,too.If your hands crack in the winter or you want to prevent pre-mature aging,try this lotion!It works!!</li>
            <li> The grape smell (which is very nice) fades pretty fast, but this is a terrific lotion. It is not greasy or sticky, and stays all day.</li>
            <li> ive bought this thru another site before, but this was a much better deal and they come sealed which adds a nice touch when presenting to a client.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item before at a local winery but was unable to get anymore of it.  The fragrance is mild but lovely and lasts allllll day.  Skin feels soft and smooth as well.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, received some as a gift years ago, and have been paying it forward ever since, everyone I give it to loves it too!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I tried it at a nail salon I was having a pedi done at, but they were asking $18.99 per 17 oz bottle! I just could not see paying that much, so I took a pic of the label &amp; searched Amazon on my mobile. I was so excited to see 3 of the 17 oz bottles for just under $27 bucks! I ordered it right there standing in the nail salon. lol Let me just say, I LOVE this lotion. The fragrance is wonderful, not overpowering but a lingering delicious smell. Trust me, I am not a lotion junkie, nor will I pay a lot for lotion, but when I smelled this lotion and felt in on my skin in the salon, I just had to have it! And most importantly, I am always interested in a lotion that keeps in moisture for awhile after applying. Usually the ones that do this are super greasy. I am happy to say this lotion is non-greasy, absorbs pretty fast and keeps your skin moisturized for some time after applying. I have only used it on my arms and hands so far, but I plan on using it as a full body moisturizer soon. My husband used it on his face and hands right after I got it and he loves it too...smells slightly girly, but hey, I am the one smelling it and I love it. lol</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I expected, I&#x27;m very disappointed. it doesn&#x27;t smells like grapes.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again from another vendor.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful absoutely love it.  The smell it so nice and I used it every day.  Love it so much!</li>
            <li> The skin moisturizer is one of the best I have used... My husband and son love it too!  They like the grape scent smell and that it&#x27;s not a greasy.  :-)</li>
            <li> Pump ddnt work on one lotion.</li>
            <li> Best lotion in the world.</li>
            <li> Our 3 daughters and myself have used this product for several years.  It has a beautiful fragrance and does what is expected - moisturizing your body.  We love the purple color of the bottle as it is one of the Mardi Gras colors (purple, yellow and green).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fan from New Orleans</li>
            <li> Love this lotion .. Only lotion I use</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!  You&#x27;ve got to try it.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The only lotion I will use! Smells great!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions.  Smooth feel, great smell.  Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> very grapy...good stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother.  She found this product a couple of  years ago and just recently used the last of it.  She was so disappointed when she could not find it locally.  So, I found the vendor, ordered the product.  Resulting in what I hope will be 6 years of grape scented bliss for my mom.  Oh, btw.....she loves the results she receives from using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but isn&#x27;t as natural as it appears... It is smooth, no greasy, smells wonderful, but has parabens in it...  look them up if you are curious.. :) Thanks</li>
            <li> quick delivery and I love it</li>
            <li> Not too greasy like some moisturizers &amp; I love the smell of this one. If you are accustomed to a heavy greasy, feel after applying body lotion this is not the one for you. It goes on smooth &amp; light, skins feels silky smooth without ever feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at leat five years now and I would not trade it for any thing I believe in it that much!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have ordered it before. But this time two of the bottles came damaged.  Their pumps were broken off and lotion had leaked out into the bag.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Love their body wash as well</li>
            <li> Two of the three pumps are broken, not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Following serious illness my skin resembled &amp;#34;snake skin&amp;#34;, I used my Grapes and voila it now is silky smooth once again.!!  Really is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> got for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister and one of them had a big crack in it (inside the package) so I used it and I love it! Too bad I couldn&#x27;t give her the whole pack of 3!</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much. Smells WONDERFUL and the scent lasts on your skin. Very light, not greasy. Feels nice on your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky on hot days. I could take a bath in this stuff.  I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, my fiance&#x27; asked what smelled so good. . .I love the smell of this lotion! So glad I bought 3 bottles. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well, esp. in this snowmaggedon of a winter we&#x27;ve been having when my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion, it smells heavenly and moisturizes well, I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, however the climate I live in is arid, so I do need a moisturizer for my skin. It is also a natural product, the only type I would use on my body. My husband uses it too, we both are pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it at home and at work.  The light scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was soooo glad to finally get this!  I have used it in the past and I could not pass up this incredible price for 3!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my aesthetician as a great anti-oxidant lotion. I love its light, sweet scent that&#x27;s not cloying, and the way it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and leaves your skin soft  and supple.</li>
            <li> My sister works for Massage Envy and during the holidays they sell this lotion. She got it for me a few years ago and I totally loved it. And for the past 3 years she had given it to me for Christmas except this year they didn&#x27;t have it so I ended up running on and found it here on Amazon. It smells amazing a nice light floral scent. Not a grape scent like you would think. It goes on is a thin layer that absorbs quickly. I really like that it is scented but I am allergic to most scented lotion and am not to this. It&#x27;s also so light that you can still wear a perfume and not have it conflict.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff tried it in a gift shop somewhere did some surfing and found it here.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product at my nail salon.  Their product provider didn&#x27;t think they would be carrying it anymore, so I bought some through Amazon.  Besides loving the scent, the product goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not greasy, like some moisturizers.  I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the effort to find another supplier if I didn&#x27;t love it. The company that actually sent it to me, Sunless Deals, got it to me very quickly, even during the holiday shipping season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watessa</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful lotion.  It is not greasy and has a light grape fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Very soothing to the skin. A great gift to share with friends and family. Will buy product again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It feels so smooth and has a wonderful smell. My daughter in law came over and I had her try some. She loved the feel and smell also. Since I had extra I gave her a bottle. Now she&#x27;s hooked on it also.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of this lotion.  It&#x27;s grape for adults!  It&#x27;s not an overwhelming candy grape smell, but rather a fruity/floral scent?  I use it every night after my shower.  It leaves my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love them - I need to order again</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I ordered online since the hair supply place I usually get from (via my hair stylist) no longer carries this size.  It&#x27;s probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I usually buy every year and give as xmas gifts.  I can still get the small purse size for &#x27;purses&#x27; or stocking stuffers.  Very happy with the product.  Nicely wrapped and VERY well packaged...the best!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, but I don&#x27;t think it does as good a job of soaking into the skin as others.  I will continue to use it, because it does ok, and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  The smell of grapes lingers all day.  Definately gets rid of dry skin and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Purchased this first at a winery while on vacation.  Once I got home I had to have MORE....for myself and as gifts.  Found this supplier and it was $ LESS per bottle than I paid at the winery!  Love the scent, fresh and clean plus it soaks right into your skin and makes you feel luxurious and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Products arrived quickly and packed professionally.</li>
