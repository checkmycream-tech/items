    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;This worked perfect.  </li>
            <li>The product is a very good sunscreen and I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a spray would be ideal for &#x27;all&#x27; skin tones.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Will give you a great vampire look.</li>
            <li>So how can I say great product?</li>
            <li>So, now I have good skin at 54.  </li>
            <li>I would welcome any suggestions for cost effective non-animal tested non-greasy body lotions w/spf.</li>
            <li>My son is fair skinned but loves to swim at our bay house.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, virtually invisible, and best of all, works very well.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that was shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is effective and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my children who are allergic to most sunscreens out in the market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay for me.</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe products but not this one.</li>
            <li>I also love that this brand does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also wish it would blend in more evenly.  </li>
            <li>We have used many non-chemical, non-paraben sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is not the most invisible but at this point, I just want something that works and will stay on and not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product claims easily applied</li>
            <li>I normally use both CeraVe face cleanser and the am/pm lotions and have been very happy with the brand so far.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen does not apply too smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it&#x27;s still a sunblock, rather than a light &amp;#34;daily lotion&amp;#34; w/ spf, which is what I&#x27;m searching for.</li>
            <li>Very effective, but it doesn&#x27;t totally disappear.</li>
            <li>However, this particular one absorbs nicely and gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with CeraVe products until they were recommended  to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I love having clear zinc oxide sun screen from a company I know and love.  </li>
            <li>As far as physical sunblocks go, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried in terms of not leaving white residue (on skin or on everything I touch afterward), and being very smooth and easy to blend</li>
            <li>The sun protection is good but for a lotion it does not easily blend easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>They had no reaction to it, and while it took a bit of rubbing to soak into the skin, it was worth the lack of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond has a promising sounding lotion w/ spf 15, but it&#x27;s only available online, and 3x more than what all the gold bond products are going for at walmart.</li>
            <li>Even more important it does NOT SMELL, unlike some other products.</li>
            <li>First, they are all SPF 30 which means I have to apply over and over.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want it on my face, yet the difficulty of spreading and rubbing into large areas makes it also impractical for use on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I emailed the seller, I was told they would not be responsible for the discrepancy in volume.</li>
            <li>The Blue Lizard is great for when you&#x27;re really going outside for a while and need serious protection, but for something quick to throw on before going to work, I just want a light lotion with a bit of spf.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, and leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>Physical Sunblock:&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with my Blue Lizard spf 30 Sensitive Skin/Baby Sunblock (same products, different name).</li>
            <li>This is better than some of the other facial products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I like to take long drives in my convertible, and the first day out this spring, I became a lobster.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe I was paying that much for a 3 oz package, but I figured I only buy sunblock once or twice per summer so who cares.</li>
            <li>It does come on white initially, but since we live near the beach, I rate sunscreen on effectiveness rather than cosmetics.</li>
            <li>did not want a hard core sunscreen, just something to easily apply daily to exposed areas (hands, forearms, neck, ears) to avoid sun exposure from daily activities like walking to and from car, driving, etc.</li>
            <li>the expire Seems to be  November 2015, not long.</li>
            <li>Also from the [false] advertising (lightweight, invisible, spreads easy), and my experience with their other products, I assumed that at least I would be getting a top quality product for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In High School I couldn&#x27;t get a tan like the other girls.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind the lower spf (i.e. 97% uv radiation blocked rather than 98%), and a mix of chemical and physical active ingredients, I would highly recommend theam face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though all sunblocks have the technical term &amp;#34;sunscreen lotion&amp;#34; usually in tiny print somewhere on the bottle, I assume to distinguish them from e.g. sprays or powders, the bold description of &amp;#34;BODY LOTION&amp;#34; on the box made me think this would be closer to a body lotion w/ spf, rather than a thick sunblock.</li>

            <li> It is so thick, you can only run it in so much</li>
            <li> like I minorly from Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> Everytime i apply it, there&#x27;s a spot on my neck that becomes really dry.</li>
            <li> It does if i used a small amount, but if i want to use a lot, and I have to use a lot since i am out at the beach in the midday sun, i end up white which i don&#x27;t mind, but it isn&#x27;t an even white cast.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected!</li>
            <li> did not have any skin reaction when I applied the other Sunscreen lotion which I brought it from drugstore.</li>
            <li> Is too thick and leaves a white film on your face.</li>
            <li> Hubby needs this for his face because other sunscreens cause him to break out even though he&#x27;s no longer a teenager!</li>
            <li> At walmart they&#x27;re the same price, while here on amazon the am spf 30 lotion appears to be a few dollars more than the horrible spf 50 body lotion.</li>
            <li> Makes you look a little ghost-like.</li>
            <li> Put it your makeup bag and use it everyday</li>
            <li> If you apply it carefully and not too thickly it disappears into the skin.  </li>
            <li> A little chalky - does the job though!</li>
            <li> The tube is really small for the price.</li>
            <li> It is thick and covers well.</li>
            <li> Thick product.</li>
            <li> last summer he had such bad break outs that it was painful to put sunscreen on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick and tacky, streaky, difficult to spread, and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies to this sunscreen, if you are allergic to aveeno and Neutrogena sunscreens do not use this product, I also bought the one for the face on the same day applied it and horrible allergies to this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the worst physical sunblocks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> What makes it difficult is looking for brands that don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> And on darker skin tones it looks horrible because it leaves white streaks and makes you look ashy.</li>
            <li> My son has very bad case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> within hours of application my skin started breaking out looked horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product for my children who are allergic to most sunscreens out in the market.  They had no reaction to it, and while it took a bit of rubbing to soak into the skin, it was worth the lack of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was shipped and received quickly.  Everything as expected!</li>
            <li> The product is a very good sunscreen and I would recommend it.  The issue i have is that this is advertised as 3.0 ounce tube and when it arrived it was only 2.8.  ounces.  When I emailed the seller, I was told they would not be responsible for the discrepancy in volume.</li>
            <li> In High School I couldn&#x27;t get a tan like the other girls. I would get a rash and welps. So, now I have good skin at 54.  Put it your makeup bag and use it everyday</li>
            <li> Can leave some white on clothes but that&#x27;s to be expect with Zinc</li>
            <li> The tube is really small for the price. The sunscreen does not apply too smoothly. It&#x27;s just okay for me. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like to take long drives in my convertible, and the first day out this spring, I became a lobster.  It is non-greasy, virtually invisible, and best of all, works very well.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. It is thick and covers well. There is no greasiness or odor. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Is too thick and leaves a white film on your face.</li>
            <li> A little chalky - does the job though!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good，but the expire Seems to be  November 2015, not long.</li>
            <li> This product claims easily applied but I could never get it to not leave white residue on my skin. It is so thick, you can only run it in so much and then it just stays. White streaks everywhere. I will not be purchasing this again. I love CeraVe products but not this one.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies to this sunscreen, if you are allergic to aveeno and Neutrogena sunscreens do not use this product, I also bought the one for the face on the same day applied it and horrible allergies to this. should be a recall on this product. within hours of application my skin started breaking out looked horrible</li>
            <li> Very effective, but it doesn&#x27;t totally disappear. Makes you look a little ghost-like.</li>
            <li> Invisible??? Well that must be a big joke... Will give you a great vampire look. Protects the skin well though, no burns, no tan.</li>
            <li> If you apply it carefully and not too thickly it disappears into the skin.  Even more important it does NOT SMELL, unlike some other products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with CeraVe products until they were recommended  to me by my dermatologist. I was having problems with dermatitis on my face until I began using  their hydrating face wash and moisturizer twice-daily. Since I&#x27;ve been using them I no longer have to use any type of medication on my face and  the breaking out is gone!  So how can I say great product? I think I already have!&lt;br /&gt;Robert Burrell</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is effective and easy to apply. It does come on white initially, but since we live near the beach, I rate sunscreen on effectiveness rather than cosmetics. I also love that this brand does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I normally use both CeraVe face cleanser and the am/pm lotions and have been very happy with the brand so far. So I decided to take a chance on this lotion, even though at walmart, it was almost twice the price as it is here on amazon. I could not believe I was paying that much for a 3 oz package, but I figured I only buy sunblock once or twice per summer so who cares. Also from the [false] advertising (lightweight, invisible, spreads easy), and my experience with their other products, I assumed that at least I would be getting a top quality product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want a hard core sunscreen, just something to easily apply daily to exposed areas (hands, forearms, neck, ears) to avoid sun exposure from daily activities like walking to and from car, driving, etc. Even though all sunblocks have the technical term &amp;#34;sunscreen lotion&amp;#34; usually in tiny print somewhere on the bottle, I assume to distinguish them from e.g. sprays or powders, the bold description of &amp;#34;BODY LOTION&amp;#34; on the box made me think this would be closer to a body lotion w/ spf, rather than a thick sunblock. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the worst physical sunblocks I&#x27;ve tried. Thick and tacky, streaky, difficult to spread, and does not absorb well. I wouldn&#x27;t want it on my face, yet the difficulty of spreading and rubbing into large areas makes it also impractical for use on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Recommended CeraVe Product:&lt;br /&gt;I should have just bought another bottle of the CeraVe am face lotion w/ spf 30, same size, but goes on like a dream. Absorbs quickly, and leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and dry to the touch. At walmart they&#x27;re the same price, while here on amazon the am spf 30 lotion appears to be a few dollars more than the horrible spf 50 body lotion. But if you don&#x27;t mind the lower spf (i.e. 97% uv radiation blocked rather than 98%), and a mix of chemical and physical active ingredients, I would highly recommend theam face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Physical Sunblock:&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with my Blue Lizard spf 30 Sensitive Skin/Baby Sunblock (same products, different name). As far as physical sunblocks go, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried in terms of not leaving white residue (on skin or on everything I touch afterward), and being very smooth and easy to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s still a sunblock, rather than a light &amp;#34;daily lotion&amp;#34; w/ spf, which is what I&#x27;m searching for. The Blue Lizard is great for when you&#x27;re really going outside for a while and need serious protection, but for something quick to throw on before going to work, I just want a light lotion with a bit of spf. What makes it difficult is looking for brands that don&#x27;t test on animals. Gold Bond has a promising sounding lotion w/ spf 15, but it&#x27;s only available online, and 3x more than what all the gold bond products are going for at walmart. I would welcome any suggestions for cost effective non-animal tested non-greasy body lotions w/spf.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; on some skin tones, not others. The sun protection is good but for a lotion it does not easily blend easily into the skin. And on darker skin tones it looks horrible because it leaves white streaks and makes you look ashy. I&#x27;ll pass. Maybe a spray would be ideal for &#x27;all&#x27; skin tones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this Sunscreen lotion caused the skin reactive and gave me rash on my arms and neck where I applied the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any skin reaction when I applied the other Sunscreen lotion which I brought it from drugstore.</li>
            <li> Everytime i apply it, there&#x27;s a spot on my neck that becomes really dry. I&#x27;ll finish the tube I have but won&#x27;t be purchasing it in the future. I also wish it would blend in more evenly.  It does if i used a small amount, but if i want to use a lot, and I have to use a lot since i am out at the beach in the midday sun, i end up white which i don&#x27;t mind, but it isn&#x27;t an even white cast.</li>
            <li> Hubby needs this for his face because other sunscreens cause him to break out even though he&#x27;s no longer a teenager!</li>
            <li> I love having clear zinc oxide sun screen from a company I know and love.  Using this all of the time now.</li>
            <li> I like all the CeraVe products. However, this particular one absorbs nicely and gives my skin a glow. It does the job. I put it on and no sunburn. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My son has very bad case of eczema.  We have used many non-chemical, non-paraben sunscreens.  First, they are all SPF 30 which means I have to apply over and over.  My son is fair skinned but loves to swim at our bay house.  We just went on a 10 day vacation there and I was so nervous b/c last summer he had such bad break outs that it was painful to put sunscreen on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked perfect.  Yes, it is not the most invisible but at this point, I just want something that works and will stay on and not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Thick product.</li>
            <li> This is better than some of the other facial products I&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t get a breakout like I minorly from Neutrogena products.  But...it is not entirely invisible zinc as it says.  You still look a bit ghostly after application.</li>
