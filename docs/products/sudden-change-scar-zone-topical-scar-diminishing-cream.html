    <ol>
            <li>and  this is the best stuff ever !!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Best scar diminishing product ever!</li>
            <li>Very good price, best scar cream ever.</li>
            <li>This cream works great for reducing the look of scars</li>
            <li>Great product, delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with this product, and for the price, it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful cream I have every purchased.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality, and very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I am a fairly vain person and got some stress pimples/adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, have  used it before.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
            <li>Additionally, one must use this product for more than 1 week to start seeing results!    </li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you actually READ the ingredients, you will find the it contains:     &gt; 4% Silicone (DIMETHICONE), which is the BEST ingredient for scar reduction!    </li>
            <li>I am not fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>a fraction of the cost of most of the scar diminishing creams and products.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to find something that diminishes scars much faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I was able to test scar products twice for extended periods.</li>
            <li>Very good product, I have bought it many times and it works, this is the fourth time</li>
            <li>I purchased Scar Zone for a new scar because it contains Zinc which   is great for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use my time to write this because I really believe you will love this product and see amazing result</li>
            <li>i have seen this product before ,and it did  a good job removing newer scars ,i do not know if it can remove older scars.let&#x27;s</li>
            <li>First off, I have to be honest..</li>
            <li>Plus I dab a huge blob of it on my scar at night so that it will stay on the skin longer which supposedly gives quicker results.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, and if anything, there&#x27;s always sunscreen over my scars.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it   does Not irritate my skin (like Mederma, etc.) !!  </li>
            <li>A plastic surgeon told me that this product was as good as the higher priced ones, and it does work really well, and it delivers on what it says it will do</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>And the plastic surgeon himself said which cream doesn&#x27;t really mater, silicon or not, but just to keep lotion on it and the rubbing/pushing/massaging on the scar more important,</li>
            <li>So in summation Kelo-cote the best as far as results, possibly being 100% silicon?</li>
            <li>.. Love this Product .. Easy on the Skin .. Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to really tell a difference because scars heal gradually over time</li>
            <li>I make sure to gently rub it in for the full 3 minutes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but making the old scars disappear is proof positive   that Scar Zone does work) !</li>
            <li>(With the new scar I couldn&#x27;t be sure if it was going   away on</li>
            <li>My scars, old and new, are fading away and becoming more smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy on her face as well and no irritating at all.</li>
            <li>DOn&#x27;t waste your time and money trying a product that isn&#x27;t as great as this one.</li>
            <li>These days it&#x27;s truly amazing to find a product that ACTUALLY works!</li>
            <li>I did a test with two fresh scars and there was no difference at the rate of repair after going through a tube.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for many years now, to soften old scars.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try for the price...good value.</li>
            <li>and I swear it is what keeps my 45 year old face looking a good 15 years younger.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is REALLY fast!</li>
            <li>It takes time, but not only does it work great on old surgery scars, but also on old cuts, stretch marks and acne scars.</li>
            <li>and I religiously get my ScarZone 2 or more times a day.</li>
            <li>First with my experience twice</li>
            <li>On to products, I tried Scarquard first, and it seemed to work a bit</li>
            <li>In addition, it has 3 other highly effective scar reduction  ingredients:    </li>
            <li>I have traveled quite a bit and have used this to keep my incision (rather large) sites protected from the sun, and to help with my healing process.</li>
            <li>I think all this product did was to smooth out the scar a bit, but it&#x27;s still obvious in terms of color.</li>
            <li>With everyone it showed some difference, but this one absolutely did nothing.</li>
            <li>and it is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Use 2 tubes of it and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted and started to use another product that I found really works,</li>
            <li>and i really do see results.</li>
            <li>However I followed the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and it seems SOME kind of result is usually seen by the end of the first week.</li>
            <li>Kelo-cote seemed to work the best (but only minor improvement over months - again body healing or cream, it did seem to make a small difference actually using after the scar was &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;, and would get my highest rating, but again I suffered some irritation so couldn&#x27;t use it more than once a day or every two days.</li>
            <li>The scar did not look ANY better after months of other scar creams, silicon gels, and pure Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s only been 3 days since I&#x27;ve bought this product and my scars already have significantly reduced in size and color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for burns or cuts, it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This okay as far as results but very soothing, and offers protection for the scar a big plus for those who get irritated by theother products, or who have scars that itch, are inflamed or &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I give this two stars instead of one because it did seem to work a little better on the scar I have on my hand.</li>
            <li>It has all but made my 10 year old scars   disappear !!</li>
            <li>But then, when I used Scar Zone on an old scar... WOW  !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at the same thing right now that I gave $16.00 for from Amazon.</li>
            <li>First, the price is so much cheaper than other scar diminishing products, yet I have read so many reviews about the other products and how they just have mineral oil and petroleum.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and WOW what a difference already!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on some acne scars on my face, both old and new, for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>My wife likes this better than the new stuff, hard to find item, thank you</li>
            <li>Its a thick cream that rubs in clear after about a minute, has a very light scent, and is not greaser and won&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife and after two weeks her face started to clear.</li>
            <li>After my knee was completely healed up I started to use it.  </li>
            <li>And for me who has sensitive skin...there hasn&#x27;t been any side affects.  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel soft..</li>
            <li>Green tea and silicone sound</li>
            <li>I have a scar that cannot be corrected with plastic surgery, and this covers it almost completely.</li>
            <li>and so far it has not irritated it at all.</li>
            <li>When I received it, i was hoping i did not waste my money and this product would work.</li>
            <li>There are so many other scar creams on the market and that are much more expensive, and since the reviews for Scar Zone weren&#x27;t shabby, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Also they all say start right when you first get the scar, so is it the product helping or the body healing the scar - hard to quantify.</li>
            <li>So far, nothing major to report on.  </li>
            <li>After so much researching and many failed attempts to reduce the redness and improve the texture of my scar, I wanted to try ScarZone.</li>
            <li>This was a major plus.  </li>
            <li>By far, this product is the \\&quot;best-bang-for-the-buck\\&quot; that actually WORKS within it&#x27;s peer group!</li>
            <li>ScarZone actually has silicon which is vital to help heal a scar.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell how much of the healing is due to the cream.  </li>
            <li>Saw no results on scars older then a few weeks, helped on the new scars but wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this for yourself.</li>
            <li>I had surgery not long ago and almost all my scars are gone!</li>
            <li>After the first day I could tell the scar was much less red and bumpy!</li>

            <li> After the first day I could tell the scar was much less red and bumpy!</li>
            <li> 2 starts instead of 1 only because I didnt try it for as long as others.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5 oz jar because hoping it would work, I know that 5 oz&#x27;s would be enough for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep the scar, you wouldn&#x27;t be spending your time reading this long review.</li>
            <li> Also, this cream takes a long time to dry out.</li>
            <li> We get the little red mustache that accompanies the constant nose blowing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not discrediting their values, but the change is to subtle to really tell.  </li>
            <li> I would only get a few at a time but they were deep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think the cream helps, but I&#x27;m in no mood to only put in on half my face, to compare what would happen.  </li>
            <li> Scar Zone product seems to have helped appearance, but only slightly, but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> i only used it for few days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this, and if you&#x27;ve bought it, keep your receipt so that you can get your money back from the company.</li>
            <li> Read carefully</li>
            <li> its look line its empty.</li>
            <li> I wash my face regularly and have a good skin care routine but the scars made my skin look horrible.</li>
            <li> Get the 5 oz jar on Amazon if you plan on using it long term like I will, for any nicks, little scars, or discoloration.</li>
            <li> My scar is still dark pink</li>
            <li> I got a two inch keloid scar on my chest even when a plastic surgeon told me the second time it would be almost invisible, all our scars are different, and our bodys&#x27; react, and heal differently making comparisons difficult or apples to oranges.</li>
            <li> and it just said \\&quot;Sun Screen\\&quot; as its active ingredient..</li>
            <li> I have been an acne sufferer for half of my life</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because the reviews are always in the middle, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different-</li>

            <li> I have use a few scar cream.</li>
            <li> It seems that a few of the people leaving reviews here</li>

            <li> I  still do have them, but it is much less visible than when I had fraxel laser for my scars!</li>
            <li> Very little scar if any</li>
            <li> Because the cream is so thick I just dip my finger in the jar and use SO little every time I apply the cream.</li>
            <li> Nothing drastic yet, but I can already see some small changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking they send me the wrong thing back in 2015</li>
            <li> and then i will put a small glob on the scar before bed.</li>
            <li> I have a small keloid scar, a doctor</li>
            <li> There are two scars on my knee, one is worse than the other and neither has improved.  </li>
            <li> The awful purple, protruding ring that was ruining the look of my belly piercing is now completely flat and getting closer and closer to my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I had a big brown scar from burn and it was very ugly.</li>
            <li> so you get really expensive sunblock.</li>
            <li> and it is fairly expensive for an over-the counter.</li>
            <li> Its non expensive</li>
            <li> The scars look just as bad now as they did when my knee healed up.  </li>
            <li> I did not buy this item through amazon because of the bad ratings.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a horribly red-purple bumpy ring around my belly piercing after snagging it really badly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem to make it go away any sooner had I not used it!</li>
            <li> i have seen this product before ,and it did  a good job removing newer scars ,i do not know if it can remove older scars.let&#x27;s wait and see time will tell. i only used it for few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 days, once or twice each day. Nothing drastic yet, but I can already see some small changes. To me, this is REALLY fast! I hope this product continues to work like this!</li>
            <li> So I have a scar on my chin from surgery (something the dermotologist cut off), and planned to use some scar cream as part my post-treatment plan. There are so many other scar creams on the market and that are much more expensive, and since the reviews for Scar Zone weren&#x27;t shabby, I decided to try it. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now and have not received any results. My scar is still dark pink and sometimes it gets red. I think all this product did was to smooth out the scar a bit, but it&#x27;s still obvious in terms of color. The directions read to use it twice a day, and I&#x27;ve been using it up to 4 times daily. Plus I dab a huge blob of it on my scar at night so that it will stay on the skin longer which supposedly gives quicker results. Not even doing that works. Also, this cream takes a long time to dry out. I give this two stars instead of one because it did seem to work a little better on the scar I have on my hand. It&#x27;s whiter but still obviously there. Bottom line: don&#x27;t waste your money on this, and if you&#x27;ve bought it, keep your receipt so that you can get your money back from the company. Get something else instead. I&#x27;m already going to purchase ScarAway since I&#x27;ve heard that actually does work.</li>
            <li> This cream works great for reducing the look of scars</li>
            <li> I have use a few scar cream. With everyone it showed some difference, but this one absolutely did nothing. I did a test with two fresh scars and there was no difference at the rate of repair after going through a tube. It is however sunblock so you get really expensive sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have had several areas where I had a burn or scrape and after using this product they virtually disappeared.  Very little scar if any and it is very soothing.  I highly recommend it for burns or cuts, it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I had surgery not long ago and almost all my scars are gone! It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> i have tried this cream for 3 months and it doesnt work .. if you read the description in back of the box it says it SHOULD help disappear scars and etc..</li>
            <li> It seems that a few of the people leaving reviews here AREN&#x27;T!    If you actually READ the ingredients, you will find the it contains:     &gt; 4% Silicone (DIMETHICONE), which is the BEST ingredient for scar reduction!    In addition, it has 3 other highly effective scar reduction  ingredients:    &gt; Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract  &gt; Allium Cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract  &gt; Vitamin E    Additionally, one must use this product for more than 1 week to start seeing results!    By far, this product is the \\&quot;best-bang-for-the-buck\\&quot; that actually WORKS within it&#x27;s peer group!</li>
            <li> I fell and tore my knee open on a chip seal road while riding my bike.  I did not want the scar I knew I would have when the knee healed so I bought Scar Zone.  After my knee was completely healed up I started to use it.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for going on 8 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement at all. The scars look just as bad now as they did when my knee healed up.  There are two scars on my knee, one is worse than the other and neither has improved.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I plan on calling them since it is guaranteed to work.</li>
            <li> Used the cream but it does nothing for scars.  Read carefully -- it claims to &amp;#34;reduce visibility of scars&amp;#34; ... guess that means by leaving a white, smeary residue on your skin.  And yes, it was applied as instructed.  Buyer be warned ...</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for many years now, to soften old scars. It takes time, but not only does it work great on old surgery scars, but also on old cuts, stretch marks and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on some acne scars on my face, both old and new, for about 2 weeks now and WOW what a difference already! I&#x27;m really impressed with this product, and for the price, it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about three weeks ago.  I recently fell and have a scar on the side of my face.  I just wanted something to help it diminish in size and help it with the healing.  So far, nothing major to report on.  It does protect it in the sun.  And for me who has sensitive skin...there hasn&#x27;t been any side affects.  Its worth a try for the price...good value.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to be honest..I only tried this for a week. However I followed the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and it seems SOME kind of result is usually seen by the end of the first week. I bought this at my local H.E.B, and after trying it saw NO results at all. It does make your skin feel soft..but so does every lotion for a lot cheaper. I was using this to try and heal/reduce acne scars. Nada. After that week I found the review someone left saying how they read the ingredients and it just said \\&quot;Sun Screen\\&quot; as its active ingredient..so I checked, and..yeah. Thats what I get for not looking at the ingredients on medicine type products I guess. &#x3D;/ Disappointed. 2 starts instead of 1 only because I didnt try it for as long as others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now over some severe pregnancy acne scars.  I haven&#x27;t been able to really tell a difference because scars heal gradually over time and I can&#x27;t tell how much of the healing is due to the cream.  My dermatologist said that the way to decrease scars is to keep out of the sun (or use a sunscreen) and just give it time.  I&#x27;d like to think the cream helps, but I&#x27;m in no mood to only put in on half my face, to compare what would happen.  Green tea and silicone sound all fancy and I&#x27;m not discrediting their values, but the change is to subtle to really tell.  It was cheap, and if anything, there&#x27;s always sunscreen over my scars.</li>
            <li> i just bought it. I open today but its look line its empty.I am not fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> To simply put it, this product did not reduce the scar on my chest at all. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this before ,but now that I needed it I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I had some places taken off my face and neck and  this is the best stuff ever !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Amazon for having what I was looking for.  You will have NO scars !!!!!  Well when I got this It was not the same stuff and I did not pay $141.00 for it !!  What I got was Scar Zone for something else.  I&#x27;m looking at the same thing right now that I gave $16.00 for from Amazon. I&#x27;m thinking they send me the wrong thing back in 2015</li>
            <li> I use this daily, not because I have scars, but because it protects my skin from the sun and I swear it is what keeps my 45 year old face looking a good 15 years younger.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I have to admit that I have never tried anything by a competitor and I never will. My scars, old and new, are fading away and becoming more smooth. DOn&#x27;t waste your time and money trying a product that isn&#x27;t as great as this one. Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This product help a little bit. Use 2 tubes of it and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted and started to use another product that I found really works,</li>
            <li> My family and I suffer from colds every year.  We get the little red mustache that accompanies the constant nose blowing.  I tried this product, and not only did it prevent the redness and pain, it relieved and dissolved the red marking.  Never thought of using it this way, but it worked!</li>
            <li> It does the work. Very good price, best scar cream ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased Scar Zone for a new scar because it contains Zinc which   is great for the skin.  The first thing I noticed is that it   does Not irritate my skin (like Mederma, etc.) !!  This was a major plus.  But then, when I used Scar Zone on an old scar... WOW  !!! I discovered   that it actually worked !!  It has all but made my 10 year old scars   disappear !! (With the new scar I couldn&#x27;t be sure if it was going   away on it&#x27;s own, but making the old scars disappear is proof positive   that Scar Zone does work) !</li>
            <li> Very good product, I have bought it many times and it works, this is the fourth time and I will keep using it. Sergio</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful cream I have every purchased.  I have a scar that cannot be corrected with plastic surgery, and this covers it almost completely.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Saw no results on scars older then a few weeks, helped on the new scars but wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this for yourself.</li>
            <li> It helped me disappear the scar left on my cesarean operation five years ago.  A month ago I had an abdominal surgery and had no doubt on buying Scar Zone for second time.  I have been using it for three weeks and the scar has diminished a lot.  I would recommend this product because it works and it´s a fraction of the cost of most of the scar diminishing creams and products.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me following surgery to repair my ankle. I have traveled quite a bit and have used this to keep my incision (rather large) sites protected from the sun, and to help with my healing process.</li>
            <li> A plastic surgeon told me that this product was as good as the higher priced ones, and it does work really well, and it delivers on what it says it will do</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s only been 3 days since I&#x27;ve bought this product and my scars already have significantly reduced in size and color. I have very sensitive skin and so far it has not irritated it at all. I make sure to gently rub it in for the full 3 minutes and then i will put a small glob on the scar before bed. I have been applying it 3 times a day. I was a little skeptical because the reviews are always in the middle, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different- if you&#x27;ve tried thousands of products like I have for battling my skin, why not give this product a try? I have not tried putting it on an active pimple since I would be too afraid of irritating it further, but as far as hyperpigmentation it works!! I have been an acne sufferer for half of my life so I am happy to find something that diminishes scars much faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Even faster than aloe vera in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the box and used this product for a solid month.  Not only did my scar not improve, I think it actually looks darker than it did before! This product did not work AT ALL for me and it is fairly expensive for an over-the counter. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and after two weeks her face started to clear. Easy on her face as well and no irritating at all.</li>
            <li> These days it&#x27;s truly amazing to find a product that ACTUALLY works! After so much researching and many failed attempts to reduce the redness and improve the texture of my scar, I wanted to try ScarZone. First, the price is so much cheaper than other scar diminishing products, yet I have read so many reviews about the other products and how they just have mineral oil and petroleum. ScarZone actually has silicon which is vital to help heal a scar. I had a horribly red-purple bumpy ring around my belly piercing after snagging it really badly. The scar did not look ANY better after months of other scar creams, silicon gels, and pure Vitamin E. After the first day I could tell the scar was much less red and bumpy! It&#x27;s been about a week and I religiously get my ScarZone 2 or more times a day. I bought the 5 oz jar because hoping it would work, I know that 5 oz&#x27;s would be enough for a very, very long time. The awful purple, protruding ring that was ruining the look of my belly piercing is now completely flat and getting closer and closer to my natural skin tone. Its a thick cream that rubs in clear after about a minute, has a very light scent, and is not greaser and won&#x27;t stain your clothes. Because the cream is so thick I just dip my finger in the jar and use SO little every time I apply the cream. This product absolutely works and I am sooooo happy that my belly piercing is not all ugly because I didn&#x27;t want to take it out because of a stupid scar! Best scar diminishing product ever! Get the 5 oz jar on Amazon if you plan on using it long term like I will, for any nicks, little scars, or discoloration.</li>
            <li> I am a fairly vain person and got some stress pimples/adult acne. I would only get a few at a time but they were deep and I would pop and then they scarred. The scars would not go away. I wash my face regularly and have a good skin care routine but the scars made my skin look horrible. I used one tube of scar zone religiously every night and it saved my face! The scars start getting lighter and lighter and eventually become basically non existent! If you are looking to get rid of scars this product is a miracle and it works!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this better than the new stuff, hard to find item, thank you</li>
            <li> .. Love this Product .. Easy on the Skin .. Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I did not buy this item through amazon because of the bad ratings. But, one month ago when I was in a store, I noticed that product on the shelf and decided to give a try and after 1 or 2 weeks I noticed that my acne scars on my cheeks were fading away! I  still do have them, but it is much less visible than when I had fraxel laser for my scars!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I had a big brown scar from burn and it was very ugly. I had it for over 3months, and it wasn&#x27;t healing. So i bought this product so I can get rid of the scar before i go on my vacation. When I received it, i was hoping i did not waste my money and this product would work. I used it for a day and saw my scar was a lot lighter. It was miracle, i couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have been using it for a week now and the scar is just getting lighter and lighter, the size of it is also getting smaller and smaller. I use it twice a day and i really do see results. I would highly recommend this product to others. Its non expensive and it does the job its suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this review think about it, would you spend around 15 dollars on this and see your scar disappear or would you want to save that money and keep that hideous scar of yours. If you want to keep the scar, you wouldn&#x27;t be spending your time reading this long review. I use my time to write this because I really believe you will love this product and see amazing result this can do.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get paid or told to write this review, i write this review because i&#x27;m one of those people that read reviews before buying them and i like to contribute to that, so people like me can read this review before buying.</li>
            <li> I have a small keloid scar, a doctor oops,  another story, so I had tried a number of products, then had the scar redone/revision (same keloid returned) by a plastic surgeon so I was able to test scar products twice for extended periods. First with my experience twice I got a two inch keloid scar on my chest even when a plastic surgeon told me the second time it would be almost invisible, all our scars are different, and our bodys&#x27; react, and heal differently making comparisons difficult or apples to oranges. And the plastic surgeon himself said which cream doesn&#x27;t really mater, silicon or not, but just to keep lotion on it and the rubbing/pushing/massaging on the scar more important, so here&#x27;s a doctor saying little difference. Some say silicon helps, some saying only on the pads, and that is actually the pressure, it is up for debate. Also they all say start right when you first get the scar, so is it the product helping or the body healing the scar - hard to quantify. On to products, I tried Scarquard first, and it seemed to work a bit but it did irritate my skin (was also having cortisone shots in my scar at the same time) so again was it time, the product, or the shots, but did seem to help. Mederma did nothing for me. Kelo-cote seemed to work the best (but only minor improvement over months - again body healing or cream, it did seem to make a small difference actually using after the scar was &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;, and would get my highest rating, but again I suffered some irritation so couldn&#x27;t use it more than once a day or every two days. Scar Zone product seems to have helped appearance, but only slightly, but does not irritate my skin. I also like that it rubs in, where as the products like Kelo-cote stay &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, and can stain/stick to clothes. So in summation Kelo-cote the best as far as results, possibly being 100% silicon? This okay as far as results but very soothing, and offers protection for the scar a big plus for those who get irritated by theother products, or who have scars that itch, are inflamed or &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work used it about 4 months and it didnt help a bit for scars sux dont waste your money</li>
            <li> does what its designed to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, have  used it before.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that had surgery by a dermatologist could use it&lt;br /&gt;to help the scars diminish.</li>
