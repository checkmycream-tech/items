            <li>it is a good size</li>
            <li>The colors are of good quality, and I use a primer</li>
            <li>Still for the price it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve swatched all of these colors on my BROWN skin as well as my mother&#x27;s FAIR skin</li>
            <li>A good buy for sure!</li>
            <li>I love the colors they go great with my skin tone!!!also</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love the color variations in the shades!</li>
            <li>I personally love it!</li>
            <li>I love this shadow palette!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love doing makeup!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this pallete!</li>
            <li>($48)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocked off two stars because no, it isn&#x27;t AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I just got this palette today and it is amazing its not just an eyeshadow</li>
            <li>This is a handy addition to my eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li>but I probably should have got the 88 warm palette.</li>
            <li>It came in intact condition with nicely bubble-wrapped.</li>
            <li>and I was very happy to see that it was available even from the true vender (BH Cosmetics).</li>
            <li>All these colors are beautiful and I&#x27;m happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Colors are perfect, blend nicely, highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on high quality makeup.</li>
            <li>Colors are great and true to picture.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to people already who have asked me where to get good, cheap makeup.</li>
            <li>The perfect pallete I have found so far for nutral looks.</li>
            <li>For me it would have been better if there was a range of coppers and reddish browns as I have medium warm skin tone.</li>
            <li>The item was available for Amazon Prime which gave me free shipping which I knew, but I was also happy to see that it gave me free tax also!</li>
            <li>This palette is not bad, but you have got to use a good primer before you use it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice palette at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice neutral and blendable shadow that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Well So far I am impressed, the colors are very pigmented and beautiful , i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect cause some of the reviews on here sound horrid.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this palette except for the color payoff on some of the lighter shades.</li>
            <li>It looks almost identical to the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette but more than $7 cheaper</li>
            <li>I looked at the palette, and they were mostly shades of brown.</li>
            <li>I guess it is safe to say that I have forgotten it.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in the palette</li>
            <li>that is almost always overpriced on Amazon and is more than this at retail anyhow.</li>
            <li>These seem more powdery.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say I love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>then i read abt this and its comparison at many places ..</li>
            <li>but if u want to try many neutral colors then buy 88..</li>
            <li>I found that I use this palette more than I thought that I would.  </li>
            <li>I got this palette on Ebay ( it was a lot cheaper there ) and it is something that I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li>and i am in love.</li>
            <li>so glad i have this</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t describe my love for it.</li>
            <li>I love makeup</li>
            <li>Not only do I use these on my eyes but its awesome for highlighting and contouring as well.</li>
            <li>Love all the browns and whites and pinks.</li>
            <li>Ladies, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is ok for starter makeup</li>
            <li>Comparable to a MAC brand palette but clearly at a better cost.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li>In fact she has used up most of the brown colors and is asking for another one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I will jump into the conclusion without taking more time:  </li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors on this palette</li>
            <li>Have ordered more product from this company.</li>
            <li>But, I recommend using an eye primer for better color payoff.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>Anywho, I would surely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this pallet elsewhere, should have bought it from Amazon for the better price.</li>
            <li>I do like it, just thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li>But its ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>You can create many looks for day and night time</li>
            <li>but these eyeshadows are more pigmented</li>
            <li>The wells are quarter size oppose to dime size, like most BH Cosmetics eye shadows.</li>
            <li>the top is see through plastic.</li>
            <li>I love This palette</li>
            <li>well i bought this for my girlfriend and wasnt satisfied.</li>
            <li>I find I use more of this and have to supplement with MAC shades anyway.</li>
            <li>Looking on youtube found an artist i love who uses this BH cosmetics and MAC and who works for MAC.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok..</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>you can create a beautiful natural look or a smokey look with this palette and the colors work for everyone!</li>
            <li>This palette contains every shade needed to create beautiful, natural eye designs.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and the variety isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love how you can blend the colors out easily.</li>
            <li>great customer relations wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice call to try and fix the comment.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price plus more!</li>
            <li>Very nicely selected neutral colors - warm &amp; cool/ matte &amp; sheer.  </li>
            <li>I wore the BH shadows over ELF Essentials Eyelid Primer in Sheer and the colors applied smoothly, blended easily, with excellent pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have every color you need right here in one cute compact!</li>
            <li>Some are pigmented but most of the light ones are nottttt.</li>
            <li>then something really bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t chalky, and I find that the colors are easily blended.</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>BH cosmetics has always been an amazing brand that really gives you the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>so this is perfect for my toned down look.</li>
            <li>It has very nice natural colors and some rich plums.</li>
            <li>so the colors are not gonna be bold!</li>
            <li>Great price, good to great quality on the actually pigment in the shadow, ok on the quality of the palette (packaging) was not expecting the lid to be clear,thought the entire palette was going to be black as it shows in the picture, although it&#x27;s nice to see what you have it makes the palette  &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; cheap...would still purchase again.</li>
            <li>Huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 different eye shadow palettes from BH Cosemetics, because not only is the price amazing, but the quality is at its best.</li>
            <li>The colors on in this palette are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>There are a few colors from this palette that I absolutely love and use and there are many that I don&#x27;t because they do not stay on great.</li>
            <li>The BH Cosmetics 28 neutral color eyeshadow palette just about fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I got my BH palette with free shipping because I have Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>The light colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades.</li>
            <li>i will recommend it to everyone who looks for a good quality and low price :))))</li>
            <li>Most of the color payoff is good enough for the money.  </li>
            <li>but besides that its very nice it has a lot more colors with pink undertones which i dont know if i like that</li>
            <li>It provides an alternative to more costly collections while giving you great color to use as is or as blending colors with other shades.  </li>
            <li>so so so much!!!</li>
            <li>This palette was my first make-up purchase and im in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>It worth just what you pay! ...</li>
            <li>The colors are great and long wearing!</li>
            <li>But it is a good buy for the price and a handy everyday eyeshadow palette for neutral makeup lovers.  </li>
            <li>I suggest if you want a really good palette get the costal scents one the colors are really buttery and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are right for all skin tones to easily match.</li>
            <li>Over all I am giving it 4 star for quick and safe shipping, all in one on the go palette, and good selection of light to dark shades.  </li>
            <li>This is a cool palette.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and I was also pleased with the packaging.</li>
            <li>The colors have a good pigment and last all day.</li>
            <li>I love this palette so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with that, at least.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping more of them would be matte</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;d return it and spend more money somewhere else for the real thing.</li>
            <li>you guys should really consider bubblewrapping it better.  </li>
            <li>i dont really like the see through top</li>
            <li>other than that it a great product.</li>
            <li>Returned quickly</li>
            <li>As long as you are aware of this, then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li>u need a base!!!I&#x27;m used to bold colors</li>
            <li>this is such a great palette and has many colors you will need to do beautiful natural makeup for either bridal or everyday look!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette to everyone and some of my makeup artist friends have fallen in love with it also.</li>
            <li>Now I will say that some shades are decently pigmented and you can get pretty good use out of this product but please dont be fooled into thinking that this is the bomb.com overall its an ok palette.</li>
            <li>It has The Bh cosmetic logo but the lid is clear and not black like shown in the picture, therefore it looks cheap but the pigmentation of the shadows are good.</li>
            <li>LOVE my new eyeshadow palette from BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>As a faithful Mac customer, I found that BH eyeshadows are just as good if not better :).</li>
            <li>HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly travel size but it works for me!</li>
            <li>This palette is very chalky and the color are either to light</li>
            <li>Especially for this price the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>Shiny, sparkles around a mature eye isn&#x27;t always the most flattering.  </li>
            <li>They go on soft but if you want more color you can add.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t feel robbed,I got what I paid for plus free shipping:)</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m pleased, for such a low price this product is really good.</li>
            <li>The price is wayyy cheaper and with the right primer (I use UD)</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t be that for 28 neutral palette right?  </li>
            <li>i was looking for neutral palette for quite long as m a beginner, i wanted to buy something reasonable but good quality stuff..</li>
            <li>I mainly got this palette because it was 11 bucks  plus free shipping.....</li>
            <li>Dark colors feel really good.  </li>
            <li>Most of the highlight colors are powdery -   Which means I need a good eyeshadow base to stick the eyeshadow and load a good amount of it in the brush.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product itself goes the color pay off is great, better than drug store brands but a little under high end brands.</li>
            <li>Definitely a staple for everyday looks, can be applied heavier for a wonderful night on the town!!!</li>
            <li>I guess I should say that you can complete an eye look with this kit easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product is half good.</li>
            <li>I wish it has a little more varity of different natural shades but there are about a dozen colors that I really love and are there own color.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is great and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am not going to sit a wrestle with an eyeshadow in the morning while I am trying to get ready or ever for that matter!</li>
            <li>Thanks for trying CS!</li>
            <li>The colors blend pretty well</li>
            <li>This is my first pallette from BH Cosmetics</li>
            <li>I really like this pallet!</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>Nothing was damaged or cracked because it was secured in bubble wrap very well!</li>
            <li>( definitely will be getting another one :) )</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>Arrived in one day exactly from ordering it.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more palates in the future.  </li>
            <li>First of all there was no receipt in the box with the pallet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did purchase this because this palette so versital with different colors of neutral shadows</li>
            <li>First of all I ordered this palette because of all the hype I have heard about all of the so called MAC dupes.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I would probably buy from this manufacturer again - the troubles are not as big a deal as how long the eye shadow does last after the application, and the colors are quite neutral, suitable for warm or cool complexions.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of colors, the only thing it&#x27;s lacking is a matte white.</li>
            <li>Most of the shades really need alot of extra help to show up.</li>
            <li>the colors are super natural and it fits any outfit I have!</li>
            <li>Provides great pigmented shades, and the palette has been complimented to me by several other artists.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and the package arrived quite fast!</li>
            <li>Few shades actually showed up on my extremely fair skin!</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice, black packaging.</li>
            <li>I hit pan on a flesh tone color I&#x27;ve been using for a highlight pretty fast, so that must be some indication of how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>I will be using it with a theatre production next week but expect it will perform just fine.  </li>
            <li>My favorite color is definitely the last burgundy color on the first row!</li>
            <li>I also use Smashbox eyeshadow and I can tell you that this one lasts much longer than the Smashbox.</li>
            <li>And Very Affordable</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are very pigmented, Ive been using it since I bought it</li>
            <li>Shipped so fast</li>
            <li>Shipping was surprisingly fast and the package came undamaged.</li>
            <li>It gets two stars (instead of one), however, for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I do really like this color of eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>I really like these shades.</li>
            <li>There is alot of browns and light browns that look the same.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because it isn&#x27;t what you would call the perfect palette, which is probably because for the past few months I have been using a higher quality eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>Not very pigmented some colors show more than others.</li>
            <li>Shipping was FAST.</li>
            <li>take much to apply a whole lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I never pay for expedited shipping, because Amazon always ships fast.</li>
            <li>it arrived with all the colors intact &amp; not broken</li>
            <li>thats all i have to say,just expected better service.</li>
            <li>Also, none of my eye shadows broke and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more palettes from BH Cosmetics in the near future.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this is my favorite eye shadow so far...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and look foward to purchasing more in the new future.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve used this palette yesterday and today, not sure if the weather or traveling thru different temps affected the pigmentation even tho I love on the west coast</li>
            <li>I looked at it directly on BH Cosmetics&#x27; website and when I went to put it in my cart and purchase it, the shipping almost cost as much as the palette on sale!</li>
            <li>I usually wear a primer for the eye anyway, but they also needed a paint pot or some kind of cream shadow.</li>
            <li>More than half of the colors are shimmers and there are matte nudes in there for layering colors.</li>
            <li>Many of the colors are so similar that it&#x27;s like getting three pots of the same color at times.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise decent for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>Very cheap cosmetic: has no pigmentation, just a little sparkling cover.</li>
            <li>but I do not have the money to get the high end stuff.</li>
            <li>when i received it was not messy or anything thanks</li>
            <li>I love how the colors on this palette can take you from everyday work</li>
            <li>As long as you do that the colors will show up much better and last longer.</li>
            <li>The compact it comes in has a clear top so you can see all of your colors and a black bottom.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to makeup or you like</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>name on the outside of the container doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I personally like the all black case,not really feeling this clear top.</li>
            <li>So I gave this 3stars because IT IS a very pretty palette,there are colors that are pigmented and depending on your skills you can work with this palette, HOWEVER I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in pigmentation with the CS palette or what but honestly alot of these colors don&#x27;t show like previous reviews stated,also two colors look the EXACT SAME.</li>
            <li>Have so many almost similar colors, which can seem good or bad depending on what you need -   </li>
            <li>The picture above is pretty deceiving.</li>
            <li>I use this on a pretty regular basis and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>I think the only thing I use more than this for natural/neutral/smokey colors would be the [[ASIN:B003UAAITA Urban Decay Naked Palette]]</li>
            <li>The one drawback is this kit is not small.</li>
            <li>and it came early on the arival date!</li>
            <li>I was surprised!</li>
            <li>There are so many different colors and the looks u can create are endless.</li>
            <li>dark, med, and light...</li>
            <li>Made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent palette, but you cannot compare it to MAC, Stila, Urban Decay or any high end brand.</li>
            <li>The plastic is cheap and have to be careful to open it and also no mirror or applicator.</li>
            <li>a beginner or u ra guru u do lots of stuff with the palette and it makes u look natural too ..</li>
            <li>... if u want to use neutral colors frequently then use this one ...</li>
            <li>AND I GOT IT FOR HER AS A SURPRISED MAN</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and use this palette SO often.</li>
            <li>Since I let my natural hair grow out</li>
            <li>I just wanted  soft and no shimmer.</li>
            <li>I would say for everyday use this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>For Professional use, it is Ok.</li>
            <li>so she could wear makeup and still look natural.</li>
            <li>i will definetly  use this palette frequently</li>
            <li>i was so confused b/w neutral palette and warm 88 palette</li>
            <li>packaging was good, only issue i had was one of the shadow pots had came out, but nothing was broken or messed up.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to show that much pigment or stay very long.</li>
            <li>So pretty much it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li>and they are all very pigmented so its not necessary to load on the color unless you just wanna be extra.</li>
            <li>Each eyeshadow in this pallet is about and inch wide so you really do get a lot of product.</li>
            <li>a barely there look</li>
            <li>Please dont be fooled about the dupes for MAC  soft brown,brown script and expresso because they are totally not dupes in this palette for those not even pigmented at all for this matter.</li>
            <li>The highlight colors are kind of awful, but the rest of the colors are okay.</li>
            <li>Only a few light, the rest dark.</li>
            <li>but I want to compare it with WET N WILD or BLACK RADIANCE eyeshadows as it is not that much pigmented too.  </li>
            <li>And deducting 1 star for the powdery and less pigmented finish of few shadows, cheap palette box and no mirror &amp; some almost similar colors.  </li>
            <li>smooth transaction tough</li>
            <li>Very little pigment and smells funny.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it is a good size</li>
            <li> The colors are of good quality, and I use a primer</li>
            <li> Still for the price it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve swatched all of these colors on my BROWN skin as well as my mother&#x27;s FAIR skin</li>

            <li> I love the colors they go great with my skin tone!!!also</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love the color variations in the shades!</li>
            <li> I personally love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shadow palette!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love doing makeup!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this pallete!</li>
            <li> ($48)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocked off two stars because no, it isn&#x27;t AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I just got this palette today and it is amazing its not just an eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This is a handy addition to my eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li> but I probably should have got the 88 warm palette.</li>
            <li> It came in intact condition with nicely bubble-wrapped.</li>
            <li> and I was very happy to see that it was available even from the true vender (BH Cosmetics).</li>
            <li> All these colors are beautiful and I&#x27;m happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> Colors are perfect, blend nicely, highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on high quality makeup.</li>
            <li> Colors are great and true to picture.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to people already who have asked me where to get good, cheap makeup.</li>
            <li> The perfect pallete I have found so far for nutral looks.</li>
            <li> For me it would have been better if there was a range of coppers and reddish browns as I have medium warm skin tone.</li>
            <li> The item was available for Amazon Prime which gave me free shipping which I knew, but I was also happy to see that it gave me free tax also!</li>
            <li> This palette is not bad, but you have got to use a good primer before you use it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice palette at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice neutral and blendable shadow that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Well So far I am impressed, the colors are very pigmented and beautiful , i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect cause some of the reviews on here sound horrid.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this palette except for the color payoff on some of the lighter shades.</li>
            <li> It looks almost identical to the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette but more than $7 cheaper</li>
            <li> I looked at the palette, and they were mostly shades of brown.</li>
            <li> I guess it is safe to say that I have forgotten it.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in the palette</li>
            <li> that is almost always overpriced on Amazon and is more than this at retail anyhow.</li>
            <li> These seem more powdery.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say I love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> then i read abt this and its comparison at many places ..</li>
            <li> but if u want to try many neutral colors then buy 88..</li>
            <li> I found that I use this palette more than I thought that I would.  </li>
            <li> I got this palette on Ebay ( it was a lot cheaper there ) and it is something that I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> and i am in love.</li>
            <li> so glad i have this</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t describe my love for it.</li>
            <li> I love makeup</li>
            <li> Not only do I use these on my eyes but its awesome for highlighting and contouring as well.</li>
            <li> Love all the browns and whites and pinks.</li>
            <li> Ladies, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is ok for starter makeup</li>
            <li> Comparable to a MAC brand palette but clearly at a better cost.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li> In fact she has used up most of the brown colors and is asking for another one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I will jump into the conclusion without taking more time:  </li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors on this palette</li>
            <li> Have ordered more product from this company.</li>
            <li> But, I recommend using an eye primer for better color payoff.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Anywho, I would surely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet elsewhere, should have bought it from Amazon for the better price.</li>
            <li> I do like it, just thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li> But its ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> You can create many looks for day and night time</li>
            <li> but these eyeshadows are more pigmented</li>
            <li> The wells are quarter size oppose to dime size, like most BH Cosmetics eye shadows.</li>
            <li> the top is see through plastic.</li>
            <li> I love This palette</li>
            <li> well i bought this for my girlfriend and wasnt satisfied.</li>
            <li> I find I use more of this and have to supplement with MAC shades anyway.</li>
            <li> Looking on youtube found an artist i love who uses this BH cosmetics and MAC and who works for MAC.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok..</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> you can create a beautiful natural look or a smokey look with this palette and the colors work for everyone!</li>
            <li> This palette contains every shade needed to create beautiful, natural eye designs.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and the variety isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love how you can blend the colors out easily.</li>
            <li> great customer relations wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice call to try and fix the comment.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price plus more!</li>
            <li> Very nicely selected neutral colors - warm &amp; cool/ matte &amp; sheer.  </li>
            <li> I wore the BH shadows over ELF Essentials Eyelid Primer in Sheer and the colors applied smoothly, blended easily, with excellent pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have every color you need right here in one cute compact!</li>
            <li> Some are pigmented but most of the light ones are nottttt.</li>
            <li> then something really bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t chalky, and I find that the colors are easily blended.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li> BH cosmetics has always been an amazing brand that really gives you the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> so this is perfect for my toned down look.</li>
            <li> It has very nice natural colors and some rich plums.</li>
            <li> so the colors are not gonna be bold!</li>
            <li> Great price, good to great quality on the actually pigment in the shadow, ok on the quality of the palette (packaging) was not expecting the lid to be clear,thought the entire palette was going to be black as it shows in the picture, although it&#x27;s nice to see what you have it makes the palette  &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; cheap...would still purchase again.</li>
            <li> Huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 different eye shadow palettes from BH Cosemetics, because not only is the price amazing, but the quality is at its best.</li>
            <li> The colors on in this palette are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> There are a few colors from this palette that I absolutely love and use and there are many that I don&#x27;t because they do not stay on great.</li>
            <li> The BH Cosmetics 28 neutral color eyeshadow palette just about fit my needs.</li>
            <li> I got my BH palette with free shipping because I have Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> The light colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades.</li>
            <li> i will recommend it to everyone who looks for a good quality and low price :))))</li>
            <li> Most of the color payoff is good enough for the money.  </li>
            <li> but besides that its very nice it has a lot more colors with pink undertones which i dont know if i like that</li>
            <li> It provides an alternative to more costly collections while giving you great color to use as is or as blending colors with other shades.  </li>
            <li> so so so much!!!</li>
            <li> This palette was my first make-up purchase and im in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> It worth just what you pay! ...</li>
            <li> The colors are great and long wearing!</li>
            <li> But it is a good buy for the price and a handy everyday eyeshadow palette for neutral makeup lovers.  </li>
            <li> I suggest if you want a really good palette get the costal scents one the colors are really buttery and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are right for all skin tones to easily match.</li>
            <li> Over all I am giving it 4 star for quick and safe shipping, all in one on the go palette, and good selection of light to dark shades.  </li>
            <li> This is a cool palette.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and I was also pleased with the packaging.</li>
            <li> The colors have a good pigment and last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with that, at least.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping more of them would be matte</li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;d return it and spend more money somewhere else for the real thing.</li>
            <li> you guys should really consider bubblewrapping it better.  </li>
            <li> i dont really like the see through top</li>
            <li> other than that it a great product.</li>
            <li> Returned quickly</li>
            <li> As long as you are aware of this, then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> u need a base!!!I&#x27;m used to bold colors</li>
            <li> this is such a great palette and has many colors you will need to do beautiful natural makeup for either bridal or everyday look!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette to everyone and some of my makeup artist friends have fallen in love with it also.</li>
            <li> Now I will say that some shades are decently pigmented and you can get pretty good use out of this product but please dont be fooled into thinking that this is the bomb.com overall its an ok palette.</li>
            <li> It has The Bh cosmetic logo but the lid is clear and not black like shown in the picture, therefore it looks cheap but the pigmentation of the shadows are good.</li>
            <li> LOVE my new eyeshadow palette from BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> As a faithful Mac customer, I found that BH eyeshadows are just as good if not better :).</li>
            <li> HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly travel size but it works for me!</li>
            <li> This palette is very chalky and the color are either to light</li>
            <li> Especially for this price the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> Shiny, sparkles around a mature eye isn&#x27;t always the most flattering.  </li>
            <li> They go on soft but if you want more color you can add.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t feel robbed,I got what I paid for plus free shipping:)</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m pleased, for such a low price this product is really good.</li>
            <li> The price is wayyy cheaper and with the right primer (I use UD)</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t be that for 28 neutral palette right?  </li>
            <li> i was looking for neutral palette for quite long as m a beginner, i wanted to buy something reasonable but good quality stuff..</li>
            <li> I mainly got this palette because it was 11 bucks  plus free shipping.....</li>
            <li> Dark colors feel really good.  </li>
            <li> Most of the highlight colors are powdery -   Which means I need a good eyeshadow base to stick the eyeshadow and load a good amount of it in the brush.  </li>
            <li> As far as the product itself goes the color pay off is great, better than drug store brands but a little under high end brands.</li>
            <li> Definitely a staple for everyday looks, can be applied heavier for a wonderful night on the town!!!</li>
            <li> I guess I should say that you can complete an eye look with this kit easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is half good.</li>
            <li> I wish it has a little more varity of different natural shades but there are about a dozen colors that I really love and are there own color.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is great and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am not going to sit a wrestle with an eyeshadow in the morning while I am trying to get ready or ever for that matter!</li>
            <li> Thanks for trying CS!</li>
            <li> The colors blend pretty well</li>
            <li> This is my first pallette from BH Cosmetics</li>
            <li> I really like this pallet!</li>
            <li> ;D</li>
            <li> Nothing was damaged or cracked because it was secured in bubble wrap very well!</li>
            <li> ( definitely will be getting another one :) )</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> Arrived in one day exactly from ordering it.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more palates in the future.  </li>
            <li> First of all there was no receipt in the box with the pallet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did purchase this because this palette so versital with different colors of neutral shadows</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered this palette because of all the hype I have heard about all of the so called MAC dupes.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I would probably buy from this manufacturer again - the troubles are not as big a deal as how long the eye shadow does last after the application, and the colors are quite neutral, suitable for warm or cool complexions.</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of colors, the only thing it&#x27;s lacking is a matte white.</li>
            <li> Most of the shades really need alot of extra help to show up.</li>
            <li> the colors are super natural and it fits any outfit I have!</li>
            <li> Provides great pigmented shades, and the palette has been complimented to me by several other artists.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and the package arrived quite fast!</li>
            <li> Few shades actually showed up on my extremely fair skin!</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice, black packaging.</li>
            <li> I hit pan on a flesh tone color I&#x27;ve been using for a highlight pretty fast, so that must be some indication of how much I like this product.</li>
            <li> I will be using it with a theatre production next week but expect it will perform just fine.  </li>
            <li> My favorite color is definitely the last burgundy color on the first row!</li>
            <li> I also use Smashbox eyeshadow and I can tell you that this one lasts much longer than the Smashbox.</li>
            <li> And Very Affordable</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very pigmented, Ive been using it since I bought it</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast</li>
            <li> Shipping was surprisingly fast and the package came undamaged.</li>
            <li> It gets two stars (instead of one), however, for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I do really like this color of eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> I really like these shades.</li>
            <li> There is alot of browns and light browns that look the same.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because it isn&#x27;t what you would call the perfect palette, which is probably because for the past few months I have been using a higher quality eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented some colors show more than others.</li>
            <li> Shipping was FAST.</li>
            <li> take much to apply a whole lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I never pay for expedited shipping, because Amazon always ships fast.</li>
            <li> it arrived with all the colors intact &amp; not broken</li>
            <li> thats all i have to say,just expected better service.</li>
            <li> Also, none of my eye shadows broke and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more palettes from BH Cosmetics in the near future.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this is my favorite eye shadow so far...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and look foward to purchasing more in the new future.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve used this palette yesterday and today, not sure if the weather or traveling thru different temps affected the pigmentation even tho I love on the west coast</li>
            <li> I looked at it directly on BH Cosmetics&#x27; website and when I went to put it in my cart and purchase it, the shipping almost cost as much as the palette on sale!</li>
            <li> I usually wear a primer for the eye anyway, but they also needed a paint pot or some kind of cream shadow.</li>
            <li> More than half of the colors are shimmers and there are matte nudes in there for layering colors.</li>
            <li> Many of the colors are so similar that it&#x27;s like getting three pots of the same color at times.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise decent for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Very cheap cosmetic: has no pigmentation, just a little sparkling cover.</li>
            <li> but I do not have the money to get the high end stuff.</li>
            <li> when i received it was not messy or anything thanks</li>
            <li> I love how the colors on this palette can take you from everyday work</li>
            <li> As long as you do that the colors will show up much better and last longer.</li>
            <li> The compact it comes in has a clear top so you can see all of your colors and a black bottom.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to makeup or you like</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> name on the outside of the container doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> I personally like the all black case,not really feeling this clear top.</li>
            <li> So I gave this 3stars because IT IS a very pretty palette,there are colors that are pigmented and depending on your skills you can work with this palette, HOWEVER I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in pigmentation with the CS palette or what but honestly alot of these colors don&#x27;t show like previous reviews stated,also two colors look the EXACT SAME.</li>
            <li> Have so many almost similar colors, which can seem good or bad depending on what you need -   </li>
            <li> The picture above is pretty deceiving.</li>
            <li> I use this on a pretty regular basis and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing I use more than this for natural/neutral/smokey colors would be the [[ASIN:B003UAAITA Urban Decay Naked Palette]]</li>
            <li> The one drawback is this kit is not small.</li>
            <li> and it came early on the arival date!</li>
            <li> I was surprised!</li>
            <li> There are so many different colors and the looks u can create are endless.</li>
            <li> dark, med, and light...</li>
            <li> Made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent palette, but you cannot compare it to MAC, Stila, Urban Decay or any high end brand.</li>
            <li> The plastic is cheap and have to be careful to open it and also no mirror or applicator.</li>
            <li> a beginner or u ra guru u do lots of stuff with the palette and it makes u look natural too ..</li>
            <li> ... if u want to use neutral colors frequently then use this one ...</li>
            <li> AND I GOT IT FOR HER AS A SURPRISED MAN</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and use this palette SO often.</li>
            <li> Since I let my natural hair grow out</li>
            <li> I just wanted  soft and no shimmer.</li>
            <li> I would say for everyday use this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> For Professional use, it is Ok.</li>
            <li> so she could wear makeup and still look natural.</li>
            <li> i will definetly  use this palette frequently</li>
            <li> i was so confused b/w neutral palette and warm 88 palette</li>
            <li> packaging was good, only issue i had was one of the shadow pots had came out, but nothing was broken or messed up.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to show that much pigment or stay very long.</li>
            <li> So pretty much it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> and they are all very pigmented so its not necessary to load on the color unless you just wanna be extra.</li>
            <li> Each eyeshadow in this pallet is about and inch wide so you really do get a lot of product.</li>
            <li> a barely there look</li>
            <li> Please dont be fooled about the dupes for MAC  soft brown,brown script and expresso because they are totally not dupes in this palette for those not even pigmented at all for this matter.</li>
            <li> The highlight colors are kind of awful, but the rest of the colors are okay.</li>
            <li> Only a few light, the rest dark.</li>
            <li> but I want to compare it with WET N WILD or BLACK RADIANCE eyeshadows as it is not that much pigmented too.  </li>
            <li> And deducting 1 star for the powdery and less pigmented finish of few shadows, cheap palette box and no mirror &amp; some almost similar colors.  </li>
            <li> smooth transaction tough</li>
            <li> Very little pigment and smells funny.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this palette, but I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the rest you could only use to blend with the other darker shades for no harsh lines..</li>
            <li> Mainly because after working in the cosmetics industry, you realize there are only a few people who manufacture these brands.</li>
            <li> On the go palette for everyday use, office use, daytime neutral look from everyone - teenager to older women.  </li>
            <li> The pic online is not true to color of what it looks like either, I thought I would have at least 5 light highlighter shades</li>
            <li> I even can use a lot of the colors on my 12 year old daughter and they don&#x27;t look too dark at all.</li>
            <li> this IS a good palette for the price, take your time and play with these colors you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only color I definitely would not use is the pink.</li>
            <li> and you definitely need a good base.</li>
            <li> of the colors ( due to the added shimmer) on African American skin , comes on the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to save some money and not have to buy an expensive brand, but ultimately, i ended up losing money</li>
            <li> but the dark brownish purple and the few lighter shades I really like.</li>
            <li> I recieved my palette quite awhile ago and the reason that I didnt review it for so long is cause I dont even think about this palette!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased two of these palettes, one for myself and the other one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette to do someone&#x27;s makeup (and also for my own personal use), but I&#x27;m really sad to say, that these shadows are not good at all.</li>
            <li> &amp; afraid that the palette was going to get mailed all broken, but noped they came in great condition, and the colors are beautifil</li>
            <li> I think paying $30 for 2 shades of eye color is ridiculous and just down right ignorant.  </li>
            <li> This results in probably half the powder on the makeup brush flying off and landing on my upper cheekbones and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a deep black it is not in this palette ladies.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the all black packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I think the ingredients in this palette is a little different from the ones in the 120 palette.</li>
            <li> My little sister is just starting to get into makeup</li>
            <li> a few of them only show up as a shimmer.</li>
            <li> I assumed it would have pastel shades of pink and purple.</li>
            <li> Nothing to blend there is not much color.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a few different colors that were versatile.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Product was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> But they are not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The collection includes mattes, satins and shimmers in a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off - Not real BH Cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased a few of their brushes to give them a try, they should arrive next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand I never carry any makeup in my purse except my lip tints; So there, no real problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to make up, but i am new to BH cosmetics, I&#x27;m a MAC cosmetics girl, but i&#x27;m really sick of the high prices, and not finding all the color variety I would like with them......</li>
            <li> the look can be endless.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Extremely upset.</li>
            <li> some maybe close to MAC dupes but not exact.</li>
            <li> for the price the cons are very minimal (lack of mirror, some colors are a bit chalky but workable).</li>
            <li> Those who gave this high review, clearly do not know makeup, because this is a fake.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked was the fact that just a few of the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t as pigmented</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care though because this is merely just a gift.</li>
            <li> from dark skin tone to fair,some of these colors don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper, usually because they are missing the brand names, but the product is the same.</li>
            <li> The colors are not evenly divided, and the pigmentation makes one have to use alot more of the product, and even with lid base it does not stay on correctly.</li>
            <li> That was a let down.  </li>
            <li> I use this one less than the others.</li>
            <li> I wish the black was a little darker, mine is hardly black at all.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are not highly pigmented, specially the medium base colors -  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I discovered that the whitest shadow was broken and made a huge mess, but that was likely the fault of the mail carriers and not the shipper or seller.</li>
            <li> Color are a little chalky though.</li>
            <li> The reason for my three-star review is that the powder has too little body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for for a few months and feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Been Using It Everyday Since I&#x27;ve Gotten It</li>
            <li> This is my everyday go-to.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not what I expected, which is my biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to have to go to that trouble, I think it would just be as beneficial to suck it up and buy MAC shades.</li>
            <li> but they r small in size</li>
            <li> Second, there was no BH cosmetics logo anywhere on it which makes me think its fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was 1 day as usual.</li>
            <li> It seems that they are pressed so hard in the pans</li>
            <li> Hardly any pigmentation and there is fall out from the shadow.</li>
            <li> Even when I use a primer or just try and pat on thick</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> It sticks so badly to my contacts, that I can&#x27;t wear contacts and this eyeshadow at the same time.</li>
            <li> Also, no good highlights in this palette.</li>
            <li> hate when ppl sell fake makeup and try to pass it off as the real one...</li>
            <li> They arrived intake, not one pod of color was broken.  </li>
            <li> Who needs to look like a rabbit or worse yet have some eye disease?  </li>
            <li> the reason is because when i received the package the box was intact but the eye shadow 2 colors were broken almost gone.</li>
            <li> Broken brown one is not usable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M TELLING YOU, YOU CAN GO WRONG....</li>
            <li> This is not BH cosmetics 28 neutral palette it is a fake a dup.  </li>
            <li> Colors are useless except for like 4, but i would stay away...</li>
            <li> SHE WENT CRAZY WHEN I GOT IT FOR HER</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not too bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love everything about this palette except for the color payoff on some of the lighter shades. a few of them only show up as a shimmer. other than that it a great product. it is easy to use and the variety isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not pigmented at all! Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Great color assortment!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for a friend who loves make-up. It looks almost identical to the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette but more than $7 cheaper which is a plus in my book! It comes in a really nice, black packaging. The picture above is pretty deceiving. I assumed it would have pastel shades of pink and purple. I looked at the palette, and they were mostly shades of brown. I don&#x27;t really care though because this is merely just a gift. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 28 shade neutral palette and it is awesome. The pigmentation is great and it is long lasting. I also use Smashbox eyeshadow and I can tell you that this one lasts much longer than the Smashbox. I&#x27;m sticking with Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> I recieved my palette quite awhile ago and the reason that I didnt review it for so long is cause I dont even think about this palette! I guess it is safe to say that I have forgotten it. It is a gore-jus palette if only I could get the colors up onto a brush or any tool for that matter! It seems that they are pressed so hard in the pans that I can not get any color pay off what so ever!! So pretty much it was a waste of my money! I guess that I am just used to the quality of MAC products that this palette just doesnt work for me! I am not going to sit a wrestle with an eyeshadow in the morning while I am trying to get ready or ever for that matter! I love the colors in the palette but I just can&#x27;t get them on the brush or applicator! Maybe I got a faulty one but I dont know. So it&#x27;s my loss I suppose.   Thanks for trying CS!</li>
            <li> Great quality neutrals for a good price. I have recommended this to people already who have asked me where to get good, cheap makeup. It has a good amount of colors, the only thing it&#x27;s lacking is a matte white. The colors blend pretty well and you can make countless looks with this (from no-makeup makeup to smokey and the things in between) I use this on a pretty regular basis and have had no problems with it. I hit pan on a flesh tone color I&#x27;ve been using for a highlight pretty fast, so that must be some indication of how much I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using for for a few months and feel I know it&#x27;s pros and cons, for the price the cons are very minimal (lack of mirror, some colors are a bit chalky but workable). If you need/want a lot of neutrals, I&#x27;d buy this. I think the only thing I use more than this for natural/neutral/smokey colors would be the [[ASIN:B003UAAITA Urban Decay Naked Palette]] that is almost always overpriced on Amazon and is more than this at retail anyhow. ($48)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocked off two stars because no, it isn&#x27;t AMAZING. But it&#x27;s definitely usable.</li>
            <li> This is a cool palette. I think the ingredients in this palette is a little different from the ones in the 120 palette. These seem more powdery. I use this one less than the others. Also, no good highlights in this palette.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say I love the eye shadows. My mom bought this set and it just wasn&#x27;t for her. I took her comment off! I love the colors they go great with my skin tone!!!also great customer relations wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice call to try and fix the comment. Great business</li>
            <li> This is a great pallette to add to your collection. It provides an alternative to more costly collections while giving you great color to use as is or as blending colors with other shades.  The price and the quality are a great value.  I was impressed and do recommend.</li>
            <li> i was looking for neutral palette for quite long as m a beginner, i wanted to buy something reasonable but good quality stuff.. and then i came across this palette and heard lot of good reviews everywhere so thot of giving it a try... i wud say its a MUST HAVE PALETTE... even u r a beginner or u ra guru u do lots of stuff with the palette and it makes u look natural too .. can experiment with various colors... i was so confused b/w neutral palette and warm 88 palette then i read abt this and its comparison at many places .. then i found 88 warm has very good colors but they r small in size ... if u want to use neutral colors frequently then use this one ...but if u want to try many neutral colors then buy 88.. but i would go for this one only.. may b in future i may give 88 a try...     hope this helps</li>
            <li> MAN MY WIFE LOVED THIS PRODUCT SHE WENT CRAZY WHEN I GOT IT FOR HER I MEAN I SEEN THIS IN STORES AND ITS NOT SCHEAP BUT HERE IT WAS AND I GOT IT FOR HER AS A SURPRISED MAN I&#x27;M TELLING YOU, YOU CAN GO WRONG....</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this palette, but I was pretty disappointed. The highlight colors are kind of awful, but the rest of the colors are okay.</li>
            <li> No problem with this palette it contains all of the neutral colors as promised.  I only use it with a primer because otherwise they don&#x27;t last. Color are a little chalky though.</li>
            <li> Great warm colors.  I found that I use this palette more than I thought that I would.  I even can use a lot of the colors on my 12 year old daughter and they don&#x27;t look too dark at all. I got this palette on Ebay ( it was a lot cheaper there ) and it is something that I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful Color Scheme And Very Affordable For It&#x27;s Great Quality. I&#x27;ve Been Using It Everyday Since I&#x27;ve Gotten It And There Is An Unlimited Amount Of Looks You Can Do With This Pallette. 5 Stars Definitely Something To Add To You&#x27;re Collection Of You&#x27;re A Fellow Makeup Junkie And Perfect To Beginners As Well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cousin she has her vanity room and she loved it made me but her another when she ran out</li>
            <li> This is not BH cosmetics 28 neutral palette it is a fake a dup.  The colors are not pigmented, they wash out.  Trust me I am a makeup artist and this is not quality. Those who gave this high review, clearly do not know makeup, because this is a fake.  Colors are useless except for like 4, but i would stay away... i knew i should brought it from the site.  SCAM SCAM RIP OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate when ppl sell fake makeup and try to pass it off as the real one...LIARS</li>
            <li> This is my first pallette from BH Cosmetics and i am in love. This pallette is just what I need because i rather something neutral then something really bright and vibrant. There are some matte eyeshadows and some that have a bit of shimmer and they are all very pigmented so its not necessary to load on the color unless you just wanna be extra.</li>
            <li> This neutral palette is a must have for anyone who adores makeup. I actually purchased two of these palettes, one for myself and the other one for my sister. The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t chalky, and I find that the colors are easily blended. Definitely a staple for everyday looks, can be applied heavier for a wonderful night on the town!!!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very pigmented, Ive been using it since I bought it I think im going to get another one. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> loved these! The pallet has shimmer and matte colors all of which can be compared to shades of MAC and Bobbi brown colors. Very pigmented and I was also pleased with the packaging. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This palette was my first make-up purchase and im in love with it. The pigmentation is AMAZIN, the quality. Shipped so fast im so glad i have this, the colors are perfect, my gosh. I RECOMMEND THIS PALETTE. NEUTRAL/WARM colors excellent.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 different eye shadow palettes from BH Cosemetics, because not only is the price amazing, but the quality is at its best. I highly recommend this palette to everyone and some of my makeup artist friends have fallen in love with it also. IT&#x27;S A MUST BUY</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I&#x27;m experimenting with the colors and could use a tutorial.  The colors have a good pigment and last all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new eyeshadow palette from BH Cosmetics. Shipping was surprisingly fast and the package came undamaged. As a faithful Mac customer, I found that BH eyeshadows are just as good if not better :). The price is wayyy cheaper and with the right primer (I use UD) it can last all day! I plan to buy more palettes from BH Cosmetics in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much. Words can&#x27;t describe my love for it. I love how you can blend the colors out easily. The only thing I disliked was the fact that just a few of the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t as pigmented but otherwise it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> This was not what I ordered. Colors didn&#x27;t look like specified and not the name of product selected . Returned quickly</li>
            <li> I love makeup but I do not have the money to get the high end stuff. BH cosmetics has always been an amazing brand that really gives you the bang for your buck! Each eyeshadow in this pallet is about and inch wide so you really do get a lot of product. Not only do I use these on my eyes but its awesome for highlighting and contouring as well.</li>
            <li> Very cheap cosmetic: has no pigmentation, just a little sparkling cover. Nothing to blend there is not much color. Wont use. Even  embarrassed to give away.</li>
            <li> it is a very good quality even for professionals.  i will recommend it to everyone who looks for a good quality and low price :))))</li>
            <li> I really like this pallet! The colors are great and long wearing! A good buy for sure! I have had mine for over a year and still haven&#x27;t had to open the additional one I purchased!</li>
            <li> It came and the colors are a beautiful option of neutral colors!  I love the color variations in the shades!</li>
            <li> Great price, good to great quality on the actually pigment in the shadow, ok on the quality of the palette (packaging) was not expecting the lid to be clear,thought the entire palette was going to be black as it shows in the picture, although it&#x27;s nice to see what you have it makes the palette  &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; cheap...would still purchase again.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews that say that these eyeshadows where so pigmented and when I received it they weren&#x27;t at all !! And it just rubs off.</li>
            <li> Colors are perfect, blend nicely, highly pigmented. I wish the black was a little darker, mine is hardly black at all. Love all the browns and whites and pinks. My favorite color is definitely the last burgundy color on the first row! Ladies, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette to do someone&#x27;s makeup (and also for my own personal use), but I&#x27;m really sad to say, that these shadows are not good at all. They barely show up on the lid (even after the lid has been primed), and what does get applied doesn&#x27;t stay on long. They look beautiful in the palette, but they don&#x27;t transfer, or blend well at all. If I would&#x27;ve known, then I would not have purchased this product. I also don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone either. It gets two stars (instead of one), however, for the fast shipping. The company that sells these palettes, shipped this out the same night I ordered it. I&#x27;m impressed with that, at least.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is so powdery that it falls from my eyelids into my eyes. It sticks so badly to my contacts, that I can&#x27;t wear contacts and this eyeshadow at the same time. Save your money, and stay away from this eyeshadow. Mine just went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> The colors on in this palette are fantastic.  I was really hoping more of them would be matte but I would say it&#x27;s about 50/50.  Shiny, sparkles around a mature eye isn&#x27;t always the most flattering.  I can still work with the shimmery as highlighter.  I do really like this color of eyeshadows.  They arrived intake, not one pod of color was broken.  The price was awesome.  I think paying $30 for 2 shades of eye color is ridiculous and just down right ignorant.  Just because it has some &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; name on the outside of the container doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.  The product arrives as promised and in great shape.  I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is a handy addition to my eye shadow collection.  The reason for my three-star review is that the powder has too little body.  This results in probably half the powder on the makeup brush flying off and landing on my upper cheekbones and around my eyes.  When I go to tissue the powder off the rest of my face, it never comes all the way off.  This occurs despite the fact that I use eye shadow primer.  Many of the colors are so similar that it&#x27;s like getting three pots of the same color at times.  Nonetheless, I would probably buy from this manufacturer again - the troubles are not as big a deal as how long the eye shadow does last after the application, and the colors are quite neutral, suitable for warm or cool complexions.</li>
            <li> Some are pigmented but most of the light ones are nottttt. Basically all the lighter shades aren&#x27;t. But I do like the darker ones.</li>
            <li> Very nice palette at a very reasonable price. I have only used it with a primer (Too Faced) and I cannot complain! It stays on all day- over 14 hours. It has very nice natural colors and some rich plums. Love it. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It is ok for starter makeup but I probably should have got the 88 warm palette. A majority of the shadows don&#x27;t show up on my nc 30-35 skin tone and are not blendable. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase</li>
            <li> Palette is a MUST own! I am a professional makeup artist and use this palette SO often. The colors are right for all skin tones to easily match. Provides great pigmented shades, and the palette has been complimented to me by several other artists. Comparable to a MAC brand palette but clearly at a better cost.</li>
            <li> I really like these shades. Since I let my natural hair grow out and I found that it&#x27;s silver salt and pepper, I choose to go to the cooler neutral colors. They go on soft but if you want more color you can add. I just wanted  soft and no shimmer. There are some shimmer colors in there but they&#x27;re not too bad. The only color I definitely would not use is the pink. Who needs to look like a rabbit or worse yet have some eye disease?  They go well with my skin coloring and the colors I choose to wear. I would probably get this again. The one drawback is this kit is not small. You probably won&#x27;t every carry this in your purse. It takes up quite a lot of space in my drawer. On the other hand I never carry any makeup in my purse except my lip tints; So there, no real problem.</li>
            <li> yay i just received my palette and its in perfect condition and the colors are just gorgeous and it came early on the arival date! Now i can have the perfect makeup for the party im going to thank you so so so much!!! ;D</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and the package arrived quite fast! Nothing was damaged or cracked because it was secured in bubble wrap very well! Been using this palette for a while now and there are no problems. Concerns with the color, pigmentation, vulnerability to creasing varies depending on how you use and apply the makeup so you purchase it and determine for yourself.I personally love it! Colors are great and true to picture.</li>
            <li> The perfect pallete I have found so far for nutral looks. I only bought it because I seen YOUTUBE beauty NITRaaB use it and I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this shadow palette! The colors are great, and it is really good quality shadow. I have used it several time since I got it. It goes on so smoothly! I definitely think this is my favorite eye shadow so far...</li>
            <li> my daughter absolutely loved it. In fact she has used up most of the brown colors and is asking for another one for Christmas. Chances are she will be getting another one. ( definitely will be getting another one :) )</li>
            <li> Great set od eye shadows lots of great pastels that can be used as a primer under a stronger eye shadow color</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone,  I just received the palette 2 days back. It came in intact condition with nicely bubble-wrapped. I will jump into the conclusion without taking more time:  PROS:  1. Very nicely selected neutral colors - warm &amp; cool/ matte &amp; sheer.  2. Most of the color payoff is good enough for the money.  3. Dark colors feel really good.  4. On the go palette for everyday use, office use, daytime neutral look from everyone - teenager to older women.  5. Sleek enough to carry in medium size purse.  CONS:  1. All of the colors are not highly pigmented, specially the medium base colors -  I am not not going to compare it with MAC or URBAN DECAY as the feel and the price range is definitely different but I want to compare it with WET N WILD or BLACK RADIANCE eyeshadows as it is not that much pigmented too.  2. Most of the highlight colors are powdery -   Which means I need a good eyeshadow base to stick the eyeshadow and load a good amount of it in the brush.  3. Have so many almost similar colors, which can seem good or bad depending on what you need -   For me it would have been better if there was a range of coppers and reddish browns as I have medium warm skin tone. But if you are very fair then I guess you may see a good difference in the colors.  4. The plastic is cheap and have to be careful to open it and also no mirror or applicator. Which would have been good if you are travelling.  Over all I am giving it 4 star for quick and safe shipping, all in one on the go palette, and good selection of light to dark shades.  And deducting 1 star for the powdery and less pigmented finish of few shadows, cheap palette box and no mirror &amp; some almost similar colors.  But it is a good buy for the price and a handy everyday eyeshadow palette for neutral makeup lovers.  Thanks !</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love doing makeup! I&#x27;m a makeup artist for a hobby (lol) and I wanted a few different colors that were versatile. These are just that! There are 28 neutral colors that are buildable! you have every color you need right here in one cute compact! This isn&#x27;t exactly travel size but it works for me! you can create a beautiful natural look or a smokey look with this palette and the colors work for everyone! these are a pressed powder type not creamy or anything like that. some are matte some are shimmer. These are known color dupes for Mac and coastal scents. The compact it comes in has a clear top so you can see all of your colors and a black bottom. The shadow pans are staying in the compact I haven&#x27;t had one fall out or crack or bust on my palette. I guess I should say that you can complete an eye look with this kit easily. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I looooovvveee this makeup palette it is a good size when i received it was not messy or anything thanks</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this pallete! Great service too!!! Arrived in one day exactly from ordering it. I&#x27;m in love. Thank you! Best service!! Only preserving from BH from now on. Great pigments and finish. Perfect for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on high quality makeup.</li>
            <li> It has The Bh cosmetic logo but the lid is clear and not black like shown in the picture, therefore it looks cheap but the pigmentation of the shadows are good.</li>
            <li> There are a few colors from this palette that I absolutely love and use and there are many that I don&#x27;t because they do not stay on great. Even when I use a primer or just try and pat on thick it does not work. I&#x27;d say this product is half good.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors on this palette but I feel there is alot of the same colors. I wish it has a little more varity of different natural shades but there are about a dozen colors that I really love and are there own color. There is alot of browns and light browns that look the same. but the dark brownish purple and the few lighter shades I really like. The pic online is not true to color of what it looks like either, I thought I would have at least 5 light highlighter shades but there is really only 2 that you could use for a highlighter but the rest you could only use to blend with the other darker shades for no harsh lines..</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly.  It looked exactly as expected.  I will be using it with a theatre production next week but expect it will perform just fine.  Have ordered more product from this company.</li>
            <li> I was surprised! &amp; afraid that the palette was going to get mailed all broken, but noped they came in great condition, and the colors are beautifil they last me all day.</li>
            <li> Product was as I expected.  Will purchase more palates in the future.  But, I recommend using an eye primer for better color payoff.</li>
            <li> First of all there was no receipt in the box with the pallet otherwise I&#x27;d return it and spend more money somewhere else for the real thing. Second, there was no BH cosmetics logo anywhere on it which makes me think its fake. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not taking any chances on this.</li>
            <li> I mainly got this palette because it was 11 bucks  plus free shipping.....can&#x27;t be that for 28 neutral palette right?  I&#x27;m glad I did purchase this because this palette so versital with different colors of neutral shadows the look can be endless.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. Maybe about 4 colors out of the 28 possible colors actually show up. Hardly any pigmentation and there is fall out from the shadow.</li>
            <li> Beautiful makeup and a great value</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! There are so many different colors and the looks u can create are endless. The colors are vibrant and easy to blend. The only thing I didnt like was the packaging, it was low quality.</li>
            <li> With a primer.  Perfection.  Love love love it.</li>
            <li> The BH Cosmetics 28 neutral color eyeshadow palette just about fit my needs. I was looking for a nice neutral and blendable shadow that is easy to apply. I&#x27;m a bit newer to using eyeshadow and this was terrific! I took off one star because it isn&#x27;t what you would call the perfect palette, which is probably because for the past few months I have been using a higher quality eyeshadow palette. Anywho, I would surely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet elsewhere, should have bought it from Amazon for the better price. I love how the colors on this palette can take you from everyday work wear to glitzy glam. More than half of the colors are shimmers and there are matte nudes in there for layering colors. This is my everyday go-to. The colors are of good quality, and I use a primer and they last all day. (I have oily lids, I have to use a primer for any type of eye makeup)</li>
            <li> Its has a great selection of color for the price. Not very pigmented some colors show more than others. But otherwise decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was FAST. But I don&#x27;t know where BH dropped the ball! This pallets is WAY OFF from the one I bought from the website. The colors are lighter, washed out and chalky. I am EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This palette is not bad, but you have got to use a good primer before you use it.  As long as you do that the colors will show up much better and last longer. Otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to show that much pigment or stay very long. It&#x27;s a decent palette, but you cannot compare it to MAC, Stila, Urban Decay or any high end brand. As long as you are aware of this, then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> The colors were different than in the picture. There pics made it look like there were about a third of each... dark, med, and light... Only a few light, the rest dark. Still like colors though. But they are not very pigmented. That was a let down.  Still for the price it was a good deal. Will use this one, but doubt will order another simply because of 2 reasons.. The colors are not evenly divided, and the pigmentation makes one have to use alot more of the product, and even with lid base it does not stay on correctly. The color fades dramatically... I do like it, just thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li> This palette contains every shade needed to create beautiful, natural eye designs. The collection includes mattes, satins and shimmers in a wide range of colors. When I tested them I found them comparable to my MAC eyeshadows in size, color, length of wear and color payoff. I wore the BH shadows over ELF Essentials Eyelid Primer in Sheer and the colors applied smoothly, blended easily, with excellent pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;  You can pay twelve dollars for 1 MAC refill pan.....or spend twelve dollars for 28 MAC dupes. I got my BH palette with free shipping because I have Amazon Prime. To me the choice is a no-brainer, the money I saved will be used for Christmas gifts!&lt;br /&gt;**Edited to add, The BH 28 Nuetral was on sale for 11.98 when I purchased***</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself but I also bought the Coastal Scents. The light colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades. But its ok for the price.</li>
            <li> This palette is very chalky and the color are either to light they don&#x27; show up or they are a repeat color throughout the palette.I suggest if you want a really good palette get the costal scents one the colors are really buttery and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors. Especially for this price the quality is amazing. You can create many looks for day and night time</li>
            <li> So I gave this 3stars because IT IS a very pretty palette,there are colors that are pigmented and depending on your skills you can work with this palette, HOWEVER I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in pigmentation with the CS palette or what but honestly alot of these colors don&#x27;t show like previous reviews stated,also two colors look the EXACT SAME. from dark skin tone to fair,some of these colors don&#x27;t show. I personally like the all black case,not really feeling this clear top. I&#x27;ve swatched all of these colors on my BROWN skin as well as my mother&#x27;s FAIR skin and you definitely need a good base. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep black it is not in this palette ladies. Overall I don&#x27;t feel robbed,I got what I paid for plus free shipping:) I will use this palette daily for contour,highlighting,natural looks.. If you&#x27;re new to makeup or you like a barely there look this is for you! I can&#x27;t stress enough that if you have darker skin u need a base!!!I&#x27;m used to bold colors so this is perfect for my toned down look.DON&#x27;T EXPECT MAC QUALITY EXPECT WHAT YOU PAID FOR.Hope this helps:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/1/13... Ok so I&#x27;ve used this palette yesterday and today, not sure if the weather or traveling thru different temps affected the pigmentation even tho I love on the west coast but these eyeshadows are more pigmented then I stated before. Keep in mind this is a neutral palette so the colors are not gonna be bold! I used Nyx jumbo pencil in milk as well as a primer and omg!! Huge difference. As I stated I am an African American with caramel brown skin so some colors will always look \\&quot;ashy\\&quot;but overall this IS a good palette for the price, take your time and play with these colors you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. I like trying seemingly cheaper brands. Mainly because after working in the cosmetics industry, you realize there are only a few people who manufacture these brands. They are cheaper, usually because they are missing the brand names, but the product is the same. I would say for everyday use this is a fantastic product. For Professional use, it is Ok. The pigments are great. The product has a shimmer effect to it. The wells are quarter size oppose to dime size, like most BH Cosmetics eye shadows. The packaging was not what I expected, which is my biggest complaint. It comes with BH Cosmetics written on the front and the top is see through plastic. I personally prefer the all black packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Pigmented&lt;br /&gt;Staying power&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take much to apply a whole lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors ( due to the added shimmer) on African American skin , comes on the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was 1 day as usual. I never pay for expedited shipping, because Amazon always ships fast.</li>
            <li> I love This palette the colors are super natural and it fits any outfit I have! I highly recommend it and look foward to purchasing more in the new future.</li>
            <li> My little sister is just starting to get into makeup so I bought her this neutral palette so she could wear makeup and still look natural. it arrived with all the colors intact &amp; not broken so we are all happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed. 2 eye shadows were shattered. Made a huge mess. Extremely upset. I was so excited to save some money and not have to buy an expensive brand, but ultimately, i ended up losing money</li>
            <li> well i bought this for my girlfriend and wasnt satisfied. the reason is because when i received the package the box was intact but the eye shadow 2 colors were broken almost gone. you guys should really consider bubblewrapping it better.  ....thats all i have to say,just expected better service.</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered this palette because of all the hype I have heard about all of the so called MAC dupes.I find that  some maybe close to MAC dupes but not exact.Please dont be fooled about the dupes for MAC  soft brown,brown script and expresso because they are totally not dupes in this palette for those not even pigmented at all for this matter.Now I will say that some shades are decently pigmented and you can get pretty good use out of this product but please dont be fooled into thinking that this is the bomb.com overall its an ok palette.It worth just what you pay! ...THE END</li>
            <li> I just got this palette today and it is amazing its not just an eyeshadow but it also says it can be a blush, highlighter, bronzer or it can contour your face i dont really like the see through top but besides that its very nice it has a lot more colors with pink undertones which i dont know if i like that but it also has variety of textures too i will definetly  use this palette frequently</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get this product for a few weeks. I looked at it directly on BH Cosmetics&#x27; website and when I went to put it in my cart and purchase it, the shipping almost cost as much as the palette on sale! It came to mind to possibly look at Amazon and I was very happy to see that it was available even from the true vender (BH Cosmetics). The item was available for Amazon Prime which gave me free shipping which I knew, but I was also happy to see that it gave me free tax also! As far as the product itself goes the color pay off is great, better than drug store brands but a little under high end brands. I am very satisfied with it. I use it for my eyes and my eyebrows. I say it is a must have for everyone who enjoys neutral eye shadows. It is worth the price plus more! Also, none of my eye shadows broke and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> this is such a great palette and has many colors you will need to do beautiful natural makeup for either bridal or everyday look! i would recommend this palette to anyone who loves makeup</li>
            <li> The colors in this are great. Most of the shades really need alot of extra help to show up. I usually wear a primer for the eye anyway, but they also needed a paint pot or some kind of cream shadow. If I&#x27;m going to have to go to that trouble, I think it would just be as beneficial to suck it up and buy MAC shades. I find I use more of this and have to supplement with MAC shades anyway.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and about 75% of the eye shadows are NOT pigmented at all! Few shades actually showed up on my extremely fair skin!</li>
            <li> This is a knock off - Not real BH Cosmetic product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! Very little pigment and smells funny.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price</li>
            <li> I received this pallette this morning and could not wait to try it out! I was a little disappointed when I discovered that the whitest shadow was broken and made a huge mess, but that was likely the fault of the mail carriers and not the shipper or seller. All these colors are beautiful and I&#x27;m happy with this product so far. I love neutral colors and this pallette is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to make up, but i am new to BH cosmetics, I&#x27;m a MAC cosmetics girl, but i&#x27;m really sick of the high prices, and not finding all the color variety I would like with them......Looking on youtube found an artist i love who uses this BH cosmetics and MAC and who works for MAC. So i decided to give BH a try......Well So far I am impressed, the colors are very pigmented and beautiful , i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect cause some of the reviews on here sound horrid. But i&#x27;m pleased, for such a low price this product is really good. I&#x27;ve also purchased a few of their brushes to give them a try, they should arrive next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good, only issue i had was one of the shadow pots had came out, but nothing was broken or messed up. I also bought the party girl palette and there were no issues at all with that one.</li>
            <li> not the best quality..it&#x27;s just ok..&lt;br /&gt;nice smooth transaction tough</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I love it. Highly recommend! Pigments are perfect, I will definately buy another palette. This makes a perfect gift also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. 1 brown shadow was totally shattered, which then went all over the inside of the palette. Had to blow it off with my hairdryer. Broken brown one is not usable.</li>
