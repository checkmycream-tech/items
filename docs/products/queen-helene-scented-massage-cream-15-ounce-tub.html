            <li>Love it great for massage and softening skin</li>
            <li>I love the smell of cucumber!</li>
            <li>I love cucumber creams!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feel on my skin</li>
            <li>My clients love the smell of cucumbers in the spring and summer</li>
            <li>I love the scent of it and my patients love it as well.</li>
            <li>The scent speaks for itself, so refreshing.</li>
            <li>The feel of this cream is superb as it glides on the body, so smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li>It does NOT smell like acucumber, more like an motoroil.</li>
            <li>I love this massaging cream for massage at night.</li>
            <li>Queen Helen does not test on animals and many of their products do not contain animal ingredients either.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a stronger scent of cucumber, other than that it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>Well...I guess as a massage cream it might be fine</li>
            <li>The product glides perfectly and a little sticky.</li>
            <li>I love the clean fresh smell and the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the light scent and it keeps my legs very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems like it could be a tad thicker for more absorbing power.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a rich cream, easy to apply, and it smells very fresh, just like real cucumbers.  </li>
            <li>It is light and refreshing, smells good and is really thick,</li>
            <li>I have used this for about 40 years to take my eye make-up off, it&#x27;s very gentle and it doesn&#x27;t irritate if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li>The hold of the cream is very good, however it may only last like around 20 mins on the same area of rubbing.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s huge) as foot massage cream and occasionally back massage cream, but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not worried to have to replace it very soon.</li>
            <li>Cucumber smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it gets the job done in less than half the price of free up cream.</li>
            <li>VERY moisturizing</li>
            <li>VERY oily</li>
            <li>I really like the masks by Queen Helene, but this is up on the fence for me.</li>
            <li>Smell is pretty gross.</li>
            <li>It leaves no sticky feeling behind, goes on smooth and feels clean.</li>
            <li>and I feel so soft afterwards....</li>
            <li>She is from the old school.</li>

            <li> --I understand that this is necesssary for the purpose of massage, and you&#x27;re supposed to wipe it off with warm wet towels after the massage, BUT I still hate the greasy texture and the greasy feelings on my skin, even just temporarily.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not go through the trouble to return it and will finish the bottle</li>
            <li> The scent is totally artificial, and apparently the color is as well.</li>
            <li> but you have to rub hard to wipe it all off.</li>
            <li> Stinks so bad, can&#x27;t use it for facial massage..</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even get passed the smell of this stuff, really nasty and not at all what I read in reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love how it feel on my skin</li>
            <li> for this price, this jar of massage oil is very nice. it reduces the friction when massage, so that your muscles instead of your skin feel the pressure and get relaxed.</li>
            <li> My clients love the smell of cucumbers in the spring and summer it&#x27;s refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Only apply a little it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect. The cream has a cucumber-y smell (not natural) but after a while I didn&#x27;t even notice it. The product glides perfectly and a little sticky. The usage suggestion said to wipe it off with damp towel, but I don&#x27;t get any irritation or allergic reaction after leaving it overnight. I&#x27;m using this cream every day for lymph massage (on self); the size is generous so I&#x27;m not worried to have to replace it very soon.</li>
            <li> I truly wish they had non flavor option. Cucumber smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it gets the job done in less than half the price of free up cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as a massage cream.. but the smell isn&#x27;t what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> I used it a lot for my patients and the smell is not too fruity, because its cucumber. The hold of the cream is very good, however it may only last like around 20 mins on the same area of rubbing. I love the scent of it and my patients love it as well. I will definitely recommend others to use this.</li>
            <li> Well...I guess as a massage cream it might be fine (I&#x27;ve never used other massage creams before), but I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. VERY moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;2. Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, nothing else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. VERY oily--I understand that this is necesssary for the purpose of massage, and you&#x27;re supposed to wipe it off with warm wet towels after the massage, BUT I still hate the greasy texture and the greasy feelings on my skin, even just temporarily. I think it blocks my pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;2. The scent is totally artificial, and apparently the color is as well. Somewhat displeasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not go through the trouble to return it and will finish the bottle (it&#x27;s huge) as foot massage cream and occasionally back massage cream, but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Stinks so bad, can&#x27;t use it for facial massage.. The smell is horrible</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the quality is in the jar. The scent speaks for itself, so refreshing. The feel of this cream is superb as it glides on the body, so smooth, soft and silky. I love it and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>

            <li> This is wonderful,,,Hubby give me a massage with this and I feel so soft afterwards....Love it great for massage and softening skin</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even get passed the smell of this stuff, really nasty and not at all what I read in reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard days work and after a long shower or soak. I love the clean fresh smell and the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  It seems like it could be a tad thicker for more absorbing power.  Otherwise, not bad.</li>
            <li> I love cucumber creams!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 40 years to take my eye make-up off, it&#x27;s very gentle and it doesn&#x27;t irritate if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream, easy to apply, and it smells very fresh, just like real cucumbers.  Little goes a long way.  I use it on hands and feet, as a night cream or after mani/pedicures.</li>
            <li> My mom uses it. She said very good and cheap.Will buy again when she runs out. She is from the old school. Loves to massage her face.</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell like acucumber, more like an motoroil. So, I had to throw it away. Whatba wast of money and time</li>
            <li> Wish it had a stronger scent of cucumber, other than that it&#x27;s awesome! It leaves no sticky feeling behind, goes on smooth and feels clean. Softens nicely!</li>
            <li> Very good, not too oily and smell good.. I love this massaging cream for massage at night. I will definitevely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I really like the masks by Queen Helene, but this is up on the fence for me. It is light and refreshing, smells good and is really thick, the only complaint that I really have is that it is super hard to take off. You can use it anywhere, I use it on my face and neck area and it works, feels good and cleans your skin but you have to rub hard to wipe it all off.</li>
            <li> Good quality massage cream. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> what we started using this cream, we use it as message cream, the skin got a lot smoother and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good for night message for face,hands and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome massage cream thank you for the quick ship</li>
            <li> The nail salon I used to go used this as their go to pedicure massage cream and I loved the way it make my legs and feet look and feel. Queen Helen does not test on animals and many of their products do not contain animal ingredients either.</li>
            <li> Smell is pretty gross. Not a fan at all and wish I could return this product, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and it keeps my legs very soft and smooth.</li>
