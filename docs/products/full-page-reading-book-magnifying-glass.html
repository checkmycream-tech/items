            <li>This magnifier is a great help in reading full pages.  </li>
            <li>It came in packaged well, got here quickly, and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is ok, but it came with two sheets of some kind of film.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had eye surgery you might be a lot better before it&#x27;s arrival (3 weeks).</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Just lay this over your paper or book and like magic , you can see.</li>
            <li>The size of is the most convenient thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good thing that it was not expensive as it has been sitting there every since.</li>
            <li>Tris product had been a recommendation from my 84 year old uncle  who is now having great problemas reading  newspapers and books.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>As my brother, who is much younger and refuses to wear glasses, was looking for a  magnifier, I got it for him and he is certainly happy with it.</li>
            <li>This did not help me see print better; it only made my head hurt more!  </li>
            <li>We bought 12 for our book club thinking we would be able to put it on the page to magnify and surprise, you have to hold it up away from the page, makes reading very uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>He is enjoying reading again thanks to this magnifier.</li>
            <li>Yes, we have a very large mailbox!</li>
            <li>Came as quick as promised.  </li>
            <li>Somebody needs to come up with a new idea and better product.</li>
            <li>It has indeed magnifed words and numbers, but it is not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It would have been good for anyone with reasonable eye sight, but the person using it has lost the central vision in one eye and has a problem with glare in both eyes</li>
            <li>You have to HOLD the item over the book your trying to read and its flimsy and not solid and not touch the book, it I had realised that I would have bought a lamp that stands on its own.  </li>
            <li>Just made them more than double their price.</li>
            <li>Would be way better product if it was actual glass.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive and I still felt cheated.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very helpful in reading a textbook.</li>
            <li>Even thou she had readers,  I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really see through it clearly.  </li>
            <li>so it was not perfect for that kind of vision.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It is big  enough to cover a full page of a book, yet not too heavy , so he can manage it  with ease.</li>
            <li>By full page they must have meant for a small paper back book.</li>
            <li>so she can use it for general larger print reading.</li>

            <li> As a professional imaging scientist, I feel I know a little something about image quality. I was disappointed with the quality of this magnifier. The image was indeed larger in size than the object being viewed. But the image was so blurry and inconsistent that it did not make type easier to read. The magnifier I recieved was not fit for the advertised purpose.</li>
            <li> These people will charge you 15&amp; restocking and hold your refund for 30 days</li>
            <li> It has indeed magnifed words and numbers, but it is not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> By full page they must have meant for a small paper back book. The magnifier is a thin sheet of plastic, and while it does magnify, the image is blurry. The frame is just black flexible vinyl.  We wanted this to read maps and it did not help at all.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected, I still have to hold it up for it to work, I was hoping all I needed to do is set it down on the page and it will magnify but I guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately it comes from China and takes a long time to arrive. If you&#x27;ve had eye surgery you might be a lot better before it&#x27;s arrival (3 weeks).</li>
            <li> Product is very cheap, poorly made and almost useless.  It is just a sheet of plastic with only slight magnification.  It was very inexpensive and I still felt cheated.  Product has since been taken off the market.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, is too flexible</li>
            <li> It was too flimsley and I couldn&#x27;t read my book as I had to hold the plastic with both hands.</li>
            <li> worked great with books, magazines, and medicine bottles alike.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t pay to get old because your arm gets shorter and you have a hard time reading without help.  This magnifier is a great help in reading full pages.  I really love it.  I will recommend to all my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> It would have been good for anyone with reasonable eye sight, but the person using it has lost the central vision in one eye and has a problem with glare in both eyes so it was not perfect for that kind of vision.&lt;br /&gt;But was happy with the prompt service.</li>
            <li> Tris product had been a recommendation from my 84 year old uncle  who is now having great problemas reading  newspapers and books. It is big  enough to cover a full page of a book, yet not too heavy , so he can manage it  with ease. As my brother, who is much younger and refuses to wear glasses, was looking for a  magnifier, I got it for him and he is certainly happy with it.</li>
            <li> The product should not be so flimsy, I have to concentrat on holding it and I loose my place in my book. So now I don&#x27;t use it all it&#x27;s done nothing for me. Somebody needs to come up with a new idea and better product.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose. If you are sitting under a lamp, the glare comes on your magnifier distracting your eyes. My wrist often gets tired of holding it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother.  She found it to be totally useless in reading books.  She said it was flimsy and you couldn&#x27;t read a page at a time with it.</li>
            <li> My wife found this a very good magnifier to use the handle makes it easy to use and hold so she can use it for general larger print reading. For smaller print she needs something stronger.</li>
            <li> We bought 12 for our book club thinking we would be able to put it on the page to magnify and surprise, you have to hold it up away from the page, makes reading very uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;Also we paid shipping for each one and they arrived all together in one box. Just made them more than double their price. Unfair!</li>
            <li> I got this magnifier for my dad for Christmas. It&#x27;s light and very easy to use. He is enjoying reading again thanks to this magnifier.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one of these to help my sight while using the computer.  My glasses are not strong enough, even though the doctor says I don&#x27;t need them any stronger.  It came in packaged well, got here quickly, and it works great.Thanks</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really see through it clearly.  Good thing that it was not expensive as it has been sitting there every since.</li>
            <li> It was what we were looking to get.  Came as quick as promised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Product is good for what it is. Was not what i expected. Would be way better product if it was actual glass. But i was satisified with it.</li>
            <li> This thing is so stupid.  It&#x27;s more annoying then helpful.</li>
            <li> This did not help me see print better; it only made my head hurt more!  For some reason, the post office could not deliver it to my house; I had to sign for it!  (???)  Yes, we have a very large mailbox!</li>
            <li> It is ok, but it came with two sheets of some kind of film.  There were absolutely no instructions on how to apply the films or what they were for.</li>
            <li> You have to HOLD the item over the book your trying to read and its flimsy and not solid and not touch the book, it I had realised that I would have bought a lamp that stands on its own.  It bends and moves while your trying to read.  So for me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad on his birthday.  He puts it in the books he is reading and can see the small letters.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with it, just didn&#x27;t meet needs.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> totally useless in reading books cant use it on paperbacks as i wanted  item is useless as have to hold it away from print to make it work</li>
            <li> Very helpful in reading a textbook.</li>
            <li> Just lay this over your paper or book and like magic , you can see. This was easier for my grandma to use on her daily paper. The size of is the most convenient thing.  She was using a maginifying glass to read the paper. Even thou she had readers,  I highly recommend.  Makes reading a pleasure again and less stressful . A must for the ageing population.</li>
            <li> Helps some readers , not me.</li>
            <li> it works, but you have to work it.</li>
            <li> convenient to use, good price</li>
            <li> Excellent aid for my brother in law&#x27;s failing eye sight. Light weight and easy to use. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.</li>
