            <li>and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>just absolutely love it. :))</li>
            <li>This hairspray has gone to the top of my list.  </li>
            <li>I have used many, many sprays and this</li>
            <li>has been my favorite now for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a hairspray with more hold, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love that it leaves your hair manageable but still holds your style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more products from this seller.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s where my love affair with it ends.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine this hairspray provides, and I like the fact that my hair feels healthy after using it.  </li>
            <li>tried it and loved it left my hair very nice</li>
            <li>I have also tried spraying it on my hair after curling my hair with hot rollers, and although it looks good at first, the hairspray does not have good hold.  </li>
            <li>Great light weight, but holds really well.</li>
            <li>Simply the best hair spray available.</li>
            <li>not stiff great shine</li>
            <li>this is your hair spray smooth and shiny hair, touchable and healthy</li>
            <li>Just right!!</li>
            <li>I love the hold this hairspray provides - it is light on the hair, provides strong hold and it is not at all sticky.</li>
            <li>It has kinda strong alcohol smell though...</li>
            <li>And the spray middle does not clog easily like many sprays do!!</li>
            <li>Speedy and accurate.</li>
            <li>Overall great product for me.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a light hairspray that holds....</li>
            <li>Just a fantastic product</li>
            <li>It has argon oil in it which leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Light hold.</li>
            <li>After purchasing literally hundreds of different hairsprays over the years, this is the absolute best one to buy.  </li>
            <li>Works great just wish it was available more place and priced a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Love the whole product line!</li>
            <li>It is not sticky on my long hair andhas a great scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years - for my fine, yet thick hair - and the price and service here are the best.</li>
            <li>Extremely light on your hair, feels nice not stiff at all.</li>
            <li>can honestly say that now that I have tried this I am sold - this is my new permanent hair spray</li>
            <li>I really liked it - it held just as good without being stiff at all.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cheaper than you buy in a salon, it&#x27;s the same wonderful product to that I have used for quite some time.</li>
            <li>If it holds my curls for 20 minutes, I&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is dry or damaged, this would make a good texturizing spray.  </li>
            <li>My first choice now in hair spray!</li>
            <li>Works really well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not even for a little fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy or sticky and a great smell.  </li>
            <li>it is more natural and washes out as soon as water hits it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray by far.</li>
            <li>So searched it in Amazon and see the previous good review and decided to buy one.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a couple of years and II like it very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Prefer Big Sexy Hair hairsprays.</li>
            <li>I have used Big Sexy Hair Spray for years -</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention that is smell so much better than regular hair</li>
            <li>I use both the touchable and regular Sexy Hair brands.</li>
            <li>I use it to hold curls after using a hot curler iron.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length layered hair and this spray offers a light flexible hold.</li>
            <li>First saw it at my hairdressers salon.</li>
            <li>It smells good and holds my baby-fine hair without making it stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before with very favorable results, however, seeing as this product never came, I would recommend seeking it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning because the smell is too intense.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>Though a bit shinny, it&#x27;s flexibility is promising</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I really like the touchable feel of this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It holds the curls very well.</li>
            <li>I love their other products but this hairspray didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little bit stronger to hold my curls all day long, but overall it is a good hair spray!</li>
            <li>No build up on hair - very manageable, soft to the touch</li>
            <li>As just a normal hairspray</li>
            <li>This hairspray is good to tame flyaways, but it has a tendency to weigh your hair down, especially if your hair is fine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out but actually gives it a healthy feel and look.  </li>
            <li>I dont like to use much hairspray because I find most hair sprays can leave your hair feeling hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It works equally well for straight, wavy or very curly hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Great hold without feeling stiff and adds a little shine.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>down to my waist and when I put it up in a pony tail, I like a clean, chic look and this stuff does just that without the stickiness.  </li>
            <li>now if u do add a ton more, of course ur hair does get hard</li>
            <li>Hair looks and feels soft and silky</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and this made my hair soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li>and my hair was still soft.</li>
            <li>Holds and is soft to touch.</li>
            <li>There is barely an odor, and it leaves your hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>Just enough hold to still look completely natural.  </li>
            <li>It has very light weight and doesnt&#x27; have the usual \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling as other hair spay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy (unless you put in an excessive amount)</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft, not stiff as other brands.</li>
            <li>I like it as it has a light hold that can be used everyday without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>I really like how this doesn&#x27;t make my hair super stiff and by the end of the day I can brush it out without my hair feeling fake and gross, and it holds pretty well throughout the day.</li>

            <li> I have shoulder length layered hair and this spray offers a light flexible hold.</li>
            <li> First saw it at my hairdressers salon.</li>
            <li> It smells good and holds my baby-fine hair without making it stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before with very favorable results, however, seeing as this product never came, I would recommend seeking it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning because the smell is too intense.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> Though a bit shinny, it&#x27;s flexibility is promising</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I really like the touchable feel of this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It holds the curls very well.</li>
            <li> I love their other products but this hairspray didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit stronger to hold my curls all day long, but overall it is a good hair spray!</li>
            <li> No build up on hair - very manageable, soft to the touch</li>
            <li> As just a normal hairspray</li>
            <li> This hairspray is good to tame flyaways, but it has a tendency to weigh your hair down, especially if your hair is fine.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out but actually gives it a healthy feel and look.  </li>
            <li> I dont like to use much hairspray because I find most hair sprays can leave your hair feeling hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It works equally well for straight, wavy or very curly hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Great hold without feeling stiff and adds a little shine.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> down to my waist and when I put it up in a pony tail, I like a clean, chic look and this stuff does just that without the stickiness.  </li>
            <li> now if u do add a ton more, of course ur hair does get hard</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels soft and silky</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and this made my hair soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was still soft.</li>
            <li> Holds and is soft to touch.</li>
            <li> There is barely an odor, and it leaves your hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> Just enough hold to still look completely natural.  </li>
            <li> It has very light weight and doesnt&#x27; have the usual \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling as other hair spay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy (unless you put in an excessive amount)</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft, not stiff as other brands.</li>
            <li> I like it as it has a light hold that can be used everyday without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I really like how this doesn&#x27;t make my hair super stiff and by the end of the day I can brush it out without my hair feeling fake and gross, and it holds pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for long lasting volume and hold, this is not the spray for you.</li>
            <li> Not a great hairspray ... but not bad either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great hairspray...but not bad either.</li>
            <li> Due to the argan oil it contains, it&#x27;s one of the only hairsprays on the market that does not dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> My new go - to, everyday hair spray.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s rated so high.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair...</li>
            <li> My hair never feels heavy or hard or sticky, just soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I use the soy for everyday and regular for long windy days.</li>
            <li> This is soft hold hairspray and I especially like it because I feel like I am at least damaging my hair LESS than with other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no hold to it.</li>
            <li> I am hooked and do not want to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Will not be using any other brand of hairspray... like ever.</li>
            <li> or you might have a problem with hair being weighed down.</li>
            <li> or you might have a problem with hair being weighed down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, and it was one of the few things that never made it to my door.</li>
            <li> Lots of moisture, rinses well, detangles, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Not too stiff yet holds well.</li>
            <li> It holds but doesn&#x27;t make hair too stiff.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does not leave your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> This doesnt leave your hair feeling stiff or builds up like alot of hairsprays I have used.  </li>
            <li> Not happy, this product came to me in a non working status and appears to be half empty.  </li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders by 5 inches..</li>
            <li> does not leave sticky or hard residue.</li>
            <li> Heard this product from Nicole Guerrio 19 from Youtube and she stated it will hold ur hair but not leaving ur hair hard..</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> try it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the worst either</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product and on time.</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to many hairsprays, but this one is excellent.  There is barely an odor, and it leaves your hair shiny.  I have had no problems with this product making me feel stuffy and itchy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, and it was one of the few things that never made it to my door. I have used this product before with very favorable results, however, seeing as this product never came, I would recommend seeking it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love this hairspray!!  Great hold without feeling stiff and adds a little shine.  Just right!! And the spray middle does not clog easily like many sprays do!!</li>
            <li> Great weightless hairspray.  No stick, no weight, good light hold, hair still moves</li>
            <li> Another one that is true to all the good reviews.  My new go - to, everyday hair spray.</li>
            <li> Great product for dyed/processed hair. Lots of moisture, rinses well, detangles, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  Smells really good too!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray ever made!!!!  I combs out smoothly with no breakage! Hair looks and feels soft and silky</li>
            <li> Speedy and accurate. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spray that would give my hairstyle body and lift without the stickiness.....this is wonderful !!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I dont like to use much hairspray because I find most hair sprays can leave your hair feeling hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; but this product is really good with that. It holds curl really nicely and has a nice smell to it too. Definetly recommend this product (:</li>
            <li> A youtuber I subscribed uses it a lot in her videos. So searched it in Amazon and see the previous good review and decided to buy one. It has very light weight and doesnt&#x27; have the usual \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling as other hair spay. and it provides good hold. It has kinda strong alcohol smell though...Not sure if it&#x27;s normal. I like it over all.</li>
            <li> Not a great hairspray ... but not bad either.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much or you might have a problem with hair being weighed down.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like hairspray then this stuff is perfect. I have the type of hair that only needs hairspray every once in a while, but I never want to use it because it makes your hair crunchy and greasy looking. After some research, I went with this hairspray and I ended up loving it. It&#x27;s super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy (unless you put in an excessive amount) and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Overall great product for me.</li>
            <li> After purchasing literally hundreds of different hairsprays over the years, this is the absolute best one to buy.  It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out but actually gives it a healthy feel and look.  I am hooked and do not want to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hairspray. It does not hold my hair (curls) like I would like it to, but does give my hair a nice finishing touch leaving it smelling good.</li>
            <li> tried it and loved it left my hair very nice not stiff great shine i think this is way better than my elnet spray! great purchase thank you guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years - for my fine, yet thick hair - and the price and service here are the best.</li>
            <li> By far the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. I have tried so many brands and this is really good quality. The smell is nice and light and the hold is perfect. Extremely light on your hair, feels nice not stiff at all. I will continue to use this from now on.</li>
            <li> Great workable hairspray. Love it.</li>
            <li> love it is all I can say!  Will definitely be buying more in the future.  Love the whole product line!</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that I use. Works really well on my fine hair. Smells great. A nice flexible hold. Makes my hair soft and shiny. The price on Amazon is great too.</li>
            <li> I really like how this doesn&#x27;t make my hair super stiff and by the end of the day I can brush it out without my hair feeling fake and gross, and it holds pretty well throughout the day. I wish it was a little bit stronger to hold my curls all day long, but overall it is a good hair spray!</li>
            <li> want shiny movable healthy hair??? this is your hair spray smooth and shiny hair, touchable and healthy try it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s rated so high.  It&#x27;s a regular hairspray with a minty fragrance.  I&#x27;m returning because the smell is too intense.  Prefer Big Sexy Hair hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I love the hold this hairspray provides - it is light on the hair, provides strong hold and it is not at all sticky. I have no problem getting my brush through my hair after using this - definite bonus. I used to buy it somewhere else that doesn&#x27;t have it anymore and I was so happy to get here. I have converted my mom to this as well.</li>
            <li> this is easily the best hair spray i have ever used. can get cheaper on amazon and 2 day shipping with prime. does not leave sticky or hard residue. it is more natural and washes out as soon as water hits it. wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Will not be using any other brand of hairspray... like ever.</li>
            <li> The spray has a minty smell to it, which I don&#x27;t like in any cosmetic or hair products. It&#x27;s not a great hairspray...but not bad either. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very sticky, but don&#x27;t use too much or you might have a problem with hair being weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best hairspray. My curls don&#x27;t tend to hold threw out the day but it&#x27;s not the worst either</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no hold to it.</li>
            <li> I have used Big Sexy Hair Spray for years - I decided to give this one a try instead and boy am I glad I did.  I really liked it - it held just as good without being stiff at all.  Oh and did I mention that is smell so much better than regular hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that now that I have tried this I am sold - this is my new permanent hair spray</li>
            <li> Good scent with strong flexible hold. Though a bit shinny, it&#x27;s flexibility is promising, I can run my fingers through my hair with it and it stays the same shape.</li>
            <li> Lightweight! Makes my hair free great!</li>
            <li> Not happy, this product came to me in a non working status and appears to be half empty.  The sprayer does not work either.  They said the item is not returnable.  Boo</li>
            <li> This is the hairspray that I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life. It&#x27;s gentle on my relaxed hair, gives me great! Shine.&lt;br /&gt;I just absolutely love it. :))</li>
            <li> This hairspray has gone to the top of my list.  It works equally well for straight, wavy or very curly hairstyles. It smells good and holds my baby-fine hair without making it stiff or sticky.  I have used many, many sprays and this has been my favorite now for about a year.  I am ordering two today so I don&#x27;t run out anytime soon.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Simply the best hair spray available.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great light weight, but holds really well.</li>
            <li> The smell it&#x27;s not so pleasant</li>
            <li> Yes! It is soft and holds perfectly. Just like it is described. I use both the touchable and regular Sexy Hair brands. I use the soy for everyday and regular for long windy days.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this made my hair soft and touchable.  It also held the curls in place.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s the best hair spray I ever tried. It does not have the &#x27;&#x27;crunchy&#x27;&#x27; feeling when it is sprayed. I recommended it 100%.</li>
            <li> It is a nice hair spray for the price. Not too stiff yet holds well.</li>
            <li> Heard this product from Nicole Guerrio 19 from Youtube and she stated it will hold ur hair but not leaving ur hair hard.. I recently did my hairs in curls.. when giving in 4 sprays, it did just the job and my hair was still soft. My hair is past my shoulders by 5 inches..now if u do add a ton more, of course ur hair does get hard but surprisingly it softens through the day , still keeping the shape u want. Will continue to buy ! perfect place to but it because the drugstores sale this product for way more expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a light hairspray that holds.... I was wrong. I love their other products but this hairspray didn&#x27;t work at all. Not even for a little fly away hair. Will not use again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only did I get speedy delivery from my order, perfect packaging, but a good deal for the money. Not only is it cheaper than you buy in a salon, it&#x27;s the same wonderful product to that I have used for quite some time. It is not sticky on my long hair andhas a great scent.</li>
            <li> The only hairspray I will use</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft, not stiff as other brands. I use it to hold curls after using a hot curler iron.</li>
            <li> I use many of the Healthy Sexy hairline products and this hairspray is great! I have shoulder length layered hair and this spray offers a light flexible hold. My hair never feels heavy or hard or sticky, just soft and natural. If you are looking for a hairspray with more hold, this is not the product for you. I like it as it has a light hold that can be used everyday without weighing hair down. As well it does not have an overly perfume smell. Just a fantastic product and I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I really like the touchable feel of this hairspray.  It is not overpowering at all and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look sticky or glued together. but yet it holds your style for hours.  The smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li> This is soft hold hairspray and I especially like it because I feel like I am at least damaging my hair LESS than with other hairsprays. It is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  Works great just wish it was available more place and priced a little cheaper.  Will continue to use and buy!</li>
            <li> Just a regular hair spray.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray by far. It lets me style my hair and never frizzes no matter how humid.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It makes your hair shiny. It holds but doesn&#x27;t make hair too stiff. Have been using it for a couple of years and II like it very much.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a beautician.  I love that it leaves your hair manageable but still holds your style.  I will order again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hairspray in years.  Saw this on YouTube and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have very long hair...down to my waist and when I put it up in a pony tail, I like a clean, chic look and this stuff does just that without the stickiness.  It has argon oil in it which leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  Has a nice scent as well.  Arrived on time and packaged good.  I&#x27;ll be buying more products from this seller.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does not leave your hair stiff. Holds and is soft to touch. Is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> No build up on hair - very manageable, soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because it is moisturizing.  Due to the argan oil it contains, it&#x27;s one of the only hairsprays on the market that does not dry my hair out.  However, that&#x27;s where my love affair with it ends.  I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.  This hairspray is good to tame flyaways, but it has a tendency to weigh your hair down, especially if your hair is fine.  I have also tried spraying it on my hair after curling my hair with hot rollers, and although it looks good at first, the hairspray does not have good hold.  If it holds my curls for 20 minutes, I&#x27;m lucky.  I love the shine this hairspray provides, and I like the fact that my hair feels healthy after using it.  But if you are looking for long lasting volume and hold, this is not the spray for you. If your hair is dry or damaged, this would make a good texturizing spray.  It will add grip and shine, but will not necessarily hold a wave or curl well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hairspray, less damaging and good hold.  My hairstylist uses it for all of her clients.</li>
            <li> This doesnt leave your hair feeling stiff or builds up like alot of hairsprays I have used.  I like all their products.  It holds the curls very well.</li>
            <li> Light hold. Feels good</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before and I&#x27;m impressed with the results. First saw it at my hairdressers salon.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or sticky and a great smell.  Just enough hold to still look completely natural.  My first choice now in hair spray!</li>
            <li> The best hair spray i ever use,love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see how its a healthier option with alcohol.. But does the job.. As just a normal hairspray</li>
