            <li>Nice for trimming nails</li>
            <li>I was so happy to finally get a good pair of cuticle scissors...to my surprise after a couple of weeks,they didn&#x27;t work and there it was:RUST!  </li>
            <li>After some great experiences with well-made products, I decided to only buy quality items I&#x27;d be happy to keep for life.</li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t so great is they have not been great for me to use with my non-dominant hand.  </li>
            <li>These were great at first.</li>
            <li>These have been very good scissors so far.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than any</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love these scissors.  </li>
            <li>and they are soooo much better than Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>More than</li>
            <li>More than ANOTHER  month passes</li>
            <li>I have bought so many cuticle and nail scissors over the years.  </li>
            <li>It feels great in the hand, is well-weighted and the steel is high quality.</li>
            <li>Like most folk I used to cheap out on the \\&quot;incidentals\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;non essentials\\&quot;--nail clippers, shavers, hair instruments, etc..</li>
            <li>These are precise and clean!  </li>
            <li>I like them just fine</li>
            <li>These are fabulous cuticle scissors.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I went on-line, filled out and printed a sharpening form, and mailed them off.</li>
            <li>They are high quality, nice weight</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since they do such a good job on fur, I can only assume they&#x27;d do a great job ..</li>
            <li>There is also good precision with this product and the scissor part is not so thick you can not do a good job.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly, strong, has a real screw (not a rivet with a slot), comfortable.</li>
            <li>Work great, sharp and get to any angle</li>
            <li>The slight curve makes them great for that.</li>
            <li>Great little scissors.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman are worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The quality costs, but is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product really - but to claim: \\&quot;Our implements are guaranteed to perform and are guaranteed against manufacturing defects.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but not as sharp as their sharpest scisors.</li>
            <li>If they had the standard round holes they would be perfect.</li>
            <li>These are nearly like a fine surgical instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These fit my hand better than other scissors.</li>
            <li>very sharp compact finger holes are a good size for your fingers if your fingers aren&#x27;t overly large.</li>
            <li>After many, many years they wore out and became dull</li>
            <li>May have to get the straight scissors next :)</li>
            <li>I use it to make small trims to my hair/bangs as well, and its size make it a handy &amp; accurate tool for that job above its primary function.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a solid brand and since I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of their tweezers, I decided to go with their scissors.  </li>
            <li>These are so much sturdier and sharper than brands like Revlon you can buy at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>These scissors work really well--thin blades,</li>
            <li>Ive since ordered the &#x27;Curved 3.5&amp;#34; Arrow Point Cuticle Stainless Steel Scissors Nail Supply Cutters&#x27; from Amazon</li>
            <li>Also, these are NOT thin cuticle scissors - these are not thin at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There isn&#x27;t much to say about scissors if they work well, as these do.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>Actually I do better using a sharp nail clipper so that is saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>From the other reviews I thought it would be much better than it is....</li>
            <li>a full month later I received an e-mail saying they received them.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I like the curvature at the tip of the scissors because they allow, when you snip, the scissor to naturally glide in whatever direction needed instead of being straight and unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>These are worth spending the extra bucks for.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made, solid quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li>Nice shape and very precise cutting possible.</li>
            <li>Allows quick, clean, accurate cutting of the fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the long sharp nose on these.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was spoiled with my old Hoffritz scissor ( they are now out of business).  </li>
            <li>They cut so effortlessly that you can do some damage if you apply the same pressure as with scissors that are not as sharp and not as precise.</li>
            <li>so I have good control, but not too small that it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li>Lately my tact has changed; I find our \\&quot;disposable culture\\&quot; quite wasteful and ecologically unsound.</li>
            <li>Because of the curvature, I find my left hand has trouble holding the scissors tightly enough to make an accurate snip.  </li>
            <li>However, they are not sharp enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li>the scissors is not sharp enough for me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Unfortunately, the attractive and unique shape of the finger holes make them extremely painful to use.  </li>
            <li> this one as a replacement, but it is not as sharp as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> These scissors are so cheaply made, within a few months the little rivet that holds them together became loose and they wouldn&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
            <li> The flat edge digs into the index finger during use.  </li>
            <li> They are tiny and sharp and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The old Hoffritz scissors was extremely sharp and the tip of the scissor was very pointy and sharp to get into hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this quality long ago.</li>
            <li> I gave this a two star rating because I did not find it sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve had one pair of their scissors for about ten years and they are still just as sharp as when I bought them.</li>
            <li> I feel this is below average because of the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li> I actually lost my previous pair and replaced them.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re just a little smaller than I&#x27;d like - by about an inch.  </li>
            <li> I put them back in the little plastic bubble case they came in along with the guarantee and mailed them to the repair address listed on their website.  </li>
            <li> Curved with precise cutting tips.</li>
            <li> but this would be a no-no to leave out---and be careful about even pricking yourself.)  </li>
            <li> They cut through cuticles that are rough.  </li>
            <li> (and be careful)</li>
            <li> The whole construction of the scissor is flawed - too soft (it bends quite easily) and the shape of the finger loops is fancy, but worthless: because of its rather triangular shape it hurts when putting pressure to cut thicker \\&quot;objects\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> careful!</li>
            <li> They are sharp.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp out of the box.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for about a year.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> Really sharp too.</li>
            <li> These are extremely well-made.</li>
            <li> So he&#x27;s living in some German castle rakeing in the money unaware or not caring that his products are poorly made and the guarantee is a joke.  </li>
            <li> I also found out from visiting their website that you can send the scissors back to them if they become dull, and they will resharpen your scissors.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit flat and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> and as I said, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I use these little scissors as a beard &amp; mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> These little scissors are VERY sharp and pointed!</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit....</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I get them back and not only was the rivet still loose, they had broken the tips off of the scissors!!!!  </li>
            <li> at least average.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste time or money on other less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> After about a month, the tiny screw between the blades loosened and made them useless.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> They have the sharpest thinest point at the end that you can get into any small part of your nail bed to clip away a hangnail.  </li>
            <li> They work well hard to keep on fingers but get the job done.</li>
            <li> A dull scissors just makes the danger of a cut easier.</li>
            <li> I would buy another pair when these start to get dull or lost.</li>
            <li> The tips are thick and dull.</li>
            <li> They also tackle thick nails.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to tolerate the crap I didn&#x27;t mind putting up with in my younger days.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and had to waste time to mail them back.</li>
            <li> and I received them worse off then when I send them in.</li>
            <li> The thing that sets them apart from the others is the thin point.  </li>
            <li> I had a real sharp one, but was taken away by the airport security :(&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought this scissor.  </li>
            <li> These scissors got twisted in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are useless when it comes to cleaning the skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> Expensive,</li>
            <li> I bought Tweezerman thinking they would last,but boy I was wrong.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;lifetime guarantee/free sharping\\&quot; is just terrible.</li>
            <li> They still won&#x27;t cut whiskers and now the screw holding the two halves together is buggered up terribly.</li>

            <li> These are fabulous cuticle scissors. Curved with precise cutting tips. These are nearly like a fine surgical instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful! They are sharp. They cut so effortlessly that you can do some damage if you apply the same pressure as with scissors that are not as sharp and not as precise. You almost feel no resistance from the blades so it takes a while to get used to the effects of this kind of excellent quality.</li>

            <li> These little scissors are VERY sharp and pointed! They are so much better than any I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are high quality, nice weight and as I said, very sharp.  Should last forever!</li>
            <li> These are so much sturdier and sharper than brands like Revlon you can buy at Walmart.  There is also good precision with this product and the scissor part is not so thick you can not do a good job.</li>

The philosophy, I believe, was that these items are throwaways &amp; who cares anyway? Lately my tact has changed; I find our \\&quot;disposable culture\\&quot; quite wasteful and ecologically unsound. And call it age, but being in my 30s I find it hard to tolerate the crap I didn&#x27;t mind putting up with in my younger days. After some great experiences with well-made products, I decided to only buy quality items I&#x27;d be happy to keep for life. That&#x27;s why I bought this pair of cuticle scissors. It feels great in the hand, is well-weighted and the steel is high quality. With occasional cleaning, sharpening &amp; oiling, this will last a lifetime. I use it to make small trims to my hair/bangs as well, and its size make it a handy &amp; accurate tool for that job above its primary function.</li>
            <li> The whole construction of the scissor is flawed - too soft (it bends quite easily) and the shape of the finger loops is fancy, but worthless: because of its rather triangular shape it hurts when putting pressure to cut thicker \\&quot;objects\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> great to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Work great, sharp and get to any angle</li>
            <li> Since I own a daycare, parents often ask me to trim the kid&#x27;s nails.  These are precise and clean!  Great price plus I never had to leave home to find them!</li>
            <li> Not using these for their intended use.  I use it to groom critter fur...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that, they are wonderful.  Sharp, easy to hold.  Allows quick, clean, accurate cutting of the fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they do such a good job on fur, I can only assume they&#x27;d do a great job .. if used in the manner they were intended..</li>
            <li> Nicely made, solid quality and very sharp. No complaints. I don&#x27;t use them to trim cuticles (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good practice.) I use these to cut my toenails.</li>
            <li> The scissors are a nice size, convenient to use. However, they are not sharp enough for the purpose. Wont recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are worth spending the extra bucks for.  Tweezerman is a solid brand and since I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of their tweezers, I decided to go with their scissors.  Good choice.  They are sharp (I don&#x27;t have kids but this would be a no-no to leave out---and be careful about even pricking yourself.)  They cut through cuticles that are rough.  They also tackle thick nails.  I like the curvature at the tip of the scissors because they allow, when you snip, the scissor to naturally glide in whatever direction needed instead of being straight and unwieldy.  The only thing that isn&#x27;t so great is they have not been great for me to use with my non-dominant hand.  Because of the curvature, I find my left hand has trouble holding the scissors tightly enough to make an accurate snip.  I know this sounds nuts, but these are also awesome to trim eyebrows.  Hey, why not make something a jack-of-all trades.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman are worth the price.  I love these scissors.  They are tiny and sharp and last a long time.  I actually lost my previous pair and replaced them.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit.... They do indeed rust.</li>
            <li> Made well. Stay sharp for about a year. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I gave this a two star rating because I did not find it sharp enough. Maybe I was spoiled with my old Hoffritz scissor ( they are now out of business).  The old Hoffritz scissors was extremely sharp and the tip of the scissor was very pointy and sharp to get into hard to reach areas. A dull scissors just makes the danger of a cut easier. Actually I do better using a sharp nail clipper so that is saying a lot.  I am sorry I bought this scissor.  From the other reviews I thought it would be much better than it is....at least average. I feel this is below average because of the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say...they&#x27;re Tweezerman - always a good bet.  Love the long sharp nose on these.</li>
            <li> These scissors work really well--thin blades, cut well using either hand.  Unfortunately, the attractive and unique shape of the finger holes make them extremely painful to use.  The flat edge digs into the index finger during use.  If they had the standard round holes they would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by the Lifetime warrantee!!  These scissors are so cheaply made, within a few months the little rivet that holds them together became loose and they wouldn&#x27;t cut properly. I put them back in the little plastic bubble case they came in along with the guarantee and mailed them to the repair address listed on their website.  A few weeks later I get them back and not only was the rivet still loose, they had broken the tips off of the scissors!!!!  Into the trash they went.  Tweezerman had a reputation for being quality but they don&#x27;t deserve it.  I e-mailed them and asked them to please give me their president&#x27;s or CEO&#x27;s address so I could let him know that their warrantee was not being honored.  Never got a reply. I tried on line to find the address of the president or CEO and I found his name but he is well protected I guess because there is NO contact address. So he&#x27;s living in some German castle rakeing in the money unaware or not caring that his products are poorly made and the guarantee is a joke.  Ive since ordered the &#x27;Curved 3.5&amp;#34; Arrow Point Cuticle Stainless Steel Scissors Nail Supply Cutters&#x27; from Amazon and they are soooo much better than Tweezerman.  Tweezerman may have been good quality 20 years ago but not anymore.  Save your money and buy  the ones mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. The blades are sharp. Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I had a real sharp one, but was taken away by the airport security :(&lt;br /&gt;Got this one as a replacement, but it is not as sharp as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> I dropped these once and now they&#x27;re hopelessly bent. Buyer beware! (and be careful)</li>
            <li> The ones I received were not the ones I ordered. I was very disappointed and had to waste time to mail them back.</li>
            <li> These scissors got twisted in about 2 weeks. i don&#x27;t even know how that was possible. Also, these are NOT thin cuticle scissors - these are not thin at all. If you&#x27;re looking for dainty manicure scissors, look elsewhere. That said, the seller was excellent.</li>
            <li> This would be a four star review but the \\&quot;lifetime guarantee/free sharping\\&quot; is just terrible. I use these little scissors as a beard &amp; mustache trimmer. The slight curve makes them great for that. After many, many years they wore out and became dull so I ordered another pair and in doing so noticed their guarantee.  I went on-line, filled out and printed a sharpening form, and mailed them off. More than a full month later I received an e-mail saying they received them. More than ANOTHER  month passes and I received them worse off then when I send them in. They still won&#x27;t cut whiskers and now the screw holding the two halves together is buggered up terribly. Not a bad product really - but to claim: \\&quot;Our implements are guaranteed to perform and are guaranteed against manufacturing defects. We will sharpen or replace (at our option) the defective implement FREE.\\&quot; - is sort of stretching the truth a bit.</li>
            <li> Really good scissors. Very sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> Nice shape and very precise cutting possible. Good manufactured!</li>
            <li> These were great at first. After about a month, the tiny screw between the blades loosened and made them useless.</li>
            <li> Great little scissors. Small so I have good control, but not too small that it&#x27;s hard to use. Really sharp too. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t trim my cuticles. The tips are thick and dull. They should not be called cuticle scissors. They are useless when it comes to cleaning the skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but not as sharp as their sharpest scisors.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly, strong, has a real screw (not a rivet with a slot), comfortable. Expensive, but I got one for my mom to replace her crappy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much to say about scissors if they work well, as these do. The quality costs, but is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love them! I lost the pair I had since I was a teen and couldn&#x27;t find same/similar quality ones in the States. This are the ones.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Nice for trimming nails</li>
            <li> Superb cuticle scissors. These fit my hand better than other scissors.</li>
            <li> Work well very sharp compact finger holes are a good size for your fingers if your fingers aren&#x27;t overly large.</li>
            <li> it is a bit flat and hard to hold. i have big hands. the scissors is not sharp enough for me</li>
            <li> I was so happy to finally get a good pair of cuticle scissors...to my surprise after a couple of weeks,they didn&#x27;t work and there it was:RUST!  I haven&#x27;t even got rid of its box! I bought Tweezerman thinking they would last,but boy I was wrong. Save your money they are garbage!</li>
            <li> Good quality. These scissors cut well</li>
            <li> These have been very good scissors so far. I bought them to trim my mustache and I have not had any concerns at all. I would buy another pair when these start to get dull or lost. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste time or money on other less expensive ones. These are extremely well-made.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this quality long ago.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many cuticle and nail scissors over the years.  The ones I keep coming back to are Tweezerman&#x27;s.  They have the sharpest thinest point at the end that you can get into any small part of your nail bed to clip away a hangnail.  They are the best.  The thing that sets them apart from the others is the thin point.  I also found out from visiting their website that you can send the scissors back to them if they become dull, and they will resharpen your scissors.  Although I&#x27;ve had one pair of their scissors for about ten years and they are still just as sharp as when I bought them.</li>
