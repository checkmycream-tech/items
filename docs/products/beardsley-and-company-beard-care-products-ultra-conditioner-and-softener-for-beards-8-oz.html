            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Best beard conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I ended up giving the rest away to a fellow awesome beard grower.</li>
            <li>And the bottle is awesome!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>great product smells great works great on beards</li>
            <li>My beard is feeling great.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>If not for the wife&#x27;s attitude, I would probably just be stoked about the effect this stuff has on the great scraggly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Lovei t. Great for the beard</li>
            <li>however, it probably wasn&#x27;t GREAT b/c he hasn&#x27;t requested a refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, too, because the Ultra Shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good beard conditioner than this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great, makes my husband&#x27;s beard super-soft and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I also think it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>it was ok--but not as good as my hair conditioner (pantene)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in beard dandruff, a very welcome side effect.</li>
            <li>The ladies love it lol</li>
            <li>Smells good and conditioned nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it, my girlfriend loves it, my beard loves it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>My beard has a much more pleasant texture, and both my husband</li>
            <li>Beard smell nice, ladies like beard nice smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;He must have liked it</li>
            <li>Good price, like the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- Not a terrible scent</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>He says that the smell isn&#x27;t that great when he first applies it, but he can&#x27;t smell it anymore after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and feels after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people and everyone loves how much better their beard feels—softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beardsley people, please make this unscented, or give it a more manly fragrance.</li>
            <li>so it can grow healthy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>The lady do love it</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet used it for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>The perfect companion to Beardsley Beard Shampoo, this conditioner elevates your beard from clean to soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>It smells nice (not a smell I would want on my beard all day, but in the shower it smells clean and refreshed).</li>
            <li>I had a pretty good beard going in AFG and used this for about a month.  </li>
            <li>I felt it accomplished what it was trying to do, made my beard softer, and had a pleasant, if strong, scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff works as advertised, beard dandruff is completely gone, the great scraggly is softer and not as willful as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t completely solve my dandruff but is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  </li>
            <li>It is a good looking bottle, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference when I use it, or don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my beard feeling very soft and nice!</li>
            <li>was initially impressed with the conditioner as well, until I started testing other conditioners in combination with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Great after the same company&#x27;s beard shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant improvements with the combination of this conditioner and the beard conditioning oil.  </li>
            <li>how much softer and more manageable it has made my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and it has made my beard so much softer.  </li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel shiny, smooth, and more manageable (less rogue hairs sticking out on their own.)</li>
            <li>v Did not feel as good as my conditioner, used for a long time.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells good and works better than past products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and really conditions my beard.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>Results were distinctly noticeable after just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am rather annoyed, I love that the product works great, I just wish it had a more masculine fragrance, or no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>His beard has been touchably soft and not stinky at all. :-)</li>
            <li>I figure women have been dealing with hair of all types far more than any man and his beard, they gotta be producing results, right?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look right, feel right, smell right or work right.</li>
            <li>as a CONDITIONER, it works very well--some of the best I&#x27;ve found--and when I am ready to go out, my beard balm or cologne has no trouble covering up any real or imagined smell left by the conditioner.</li>
            <li>(I only use it a few times a week$. Still a great product!</li>
            <li>I quickly discovered that the ultra conditioner wasn&#x27;t really doing anything to help my beard.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>One my second tube now after more than a year</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first actual beard shampoo and conditioner that I have bought and after a couple of uses I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell (Wild Berry) and</li>
            <li>But the smell reminds me of my college drinking days when we power drank, threw up in some bushes, found that the only gum to be had was bubalicious, and contined partying on with that smell/taste until I was able to get home.  </li>
            <li>farmers\\&quot; would be interested in at all.</li>
            <li>first combination I ever tried was the Beardsley Ultra Shampoo and Ultra Conditioner.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it requires a lot of conditioner to get a proper lather going.</li>
            <li>Be warned, you should only use this product if you want people touching you beard, because it will be very pettable (try not to pet your face in meetings, it looks</li>
            <li>Product lathers alright but has a very funky smell to it.</li>
            <li>So the whole tube just sits on my counter.</li>
            <li>And I notice that my electric beard trimmer cuts through my beard a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>I much prefer beard oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle is almost gone, I can&#x27;t say how much its doing for my beard</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I have to use to much to get my beard somewhat close to the softness I want and doesn&#x27;t smell as manly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in texture or anything while I was using this.  </li>
            <li>Make maintaining so much easier.</li>
            <li>Leaves the beard much softer and silkier.</li>
            <li>he used the whole bottle...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really feel the need to use conditioner in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my brother absolutely loves this, he has to hide from roomates</li>
            <li>Often twice as much shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would describe the Wild Berry Flavor as being an inoffensive variation of \\&quot;bubble gum\\&quot; for many guys it&#x27;s probably no big deal.</li>
            <li>I have found that many of the products targeted for facial hair are not gimmicky and do, in fact, suit those areas</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously to get the full effect you need a slightly longer beard so multiple applications can work their magic, but even on a shorter beard(like when it curls back and pokes you) or even generous stubble it will help reduce itchiness and scratchiness in general while the shampoo keeps your skin in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>More for less.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider this a decent option in a pinch but</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend—STILL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As long as I&#x27;ve been growing my beard, they way I clean</li>
            <li>Used to use normal shampoo and conditioner on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  </li>
            <li>the real issue and why I am not giving this 5 stars, is the fragrance, this stuff has some \\&quot;wild berry flavor\\&quot; going on.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit on the &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; side, rather than smelling like the woods or an oil rig or a 6hr bus ride, but then again, I don&#x27;t usually condition my beard and run straight to the club...</li>
            <li>makes beard soft  not that much better than any typical conditioner</li>
            <li>After my original review of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; I figured I would continue to use the stuff because I had spent money on it and wasn&#x27;t about to throw it away.</li>
            <li>Pretty much just a standard hair conditioner - nothing special or &amp;#34;beard-specific&amp;#34; for this product other than the branding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles.</li>
            <li>leave my new beard and &#x27;stache soft and my fiance no longer complains about the pricklies!</li>
            <li>made my bear very soft</li>
            <li>His beard was definitely softer even after the first use.</li>
            <li>Soft beard will use again!</li>
            <li>My wife notes particularly that it isn&#x27;t a manly scent, a real knee capping of my daily regime with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also very economical – a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it clearly outperforms the &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I didn&#x27;t think it smelled nearly as girly as some of the reviewers.</li>
            <li>Mixed expectations, much?</li>
            <li>So i am looking forward to seeing how soft it make my beard once it gets longer again</li>
            <li>My husband has very curly hair, and his beard hair is very coarse.</li>
            <li>Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products.</li>
            <li>(i also use beard oil, so I cannot tell you which is actually the one making it softer and more tame), but it can&#x27;t be hurting, AND my face under my beard doesn&#x27;t itch and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my entire adult life how abrasive it is.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesnt taste bad if it gets in your mouth and makes my curly beard noticeably softer.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Obviously to get the full effect you need a slightly longer beard so multiple applications can work their magic, but even on a shorter beard(like when it curls back and pokes you) or even generous stubble it will help reduce itchiness and scratchiness in general while the shampoo keeps your skin in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> More for less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider this a decent option in a pinch but</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend—STILL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;ve been growing my beard, they way I clean</li>
            <li> Used to use normal shampoo and conditioner on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  </li>
            <li> the real issue and why I am not giving this 5 stars, is the fragrance, this stuff has some \\&quot;wild berry flavor\\&quot; going on.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a bit on the &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; side, rather than smelling like the woods or an oil rig or a 6hr bus ride, but then again, I don&#x27;t usually condition my beard and run straight to the club...</li>
            <li> makes beard soft  not that much better than any typical conditioner</li>
            <li> After my original review of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; I figured I would continue to use the stuff because I had spent money on it and wasn&#x27;t about to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Pretty much just a standard hair conditioner - nothing special or &amp;#34;beard-specific&amp;#34; for this product other than the branding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me.</li>
            <li> The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles.</li>
            <li> leave my new beard and &#x27;stache soft and my fiance no longer complains about the pricklies!</li>
            <li> made my bear very soft</li>
            <li> His beard was definitely softer even after the first use.</li>
            <li> Soft beard will use again!</li>
            <li> My wife notes particularly that it isn&#x27;t a manly scent, a real knee capping of my daily regime with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also very economical – a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it clearly outperforms the &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I didn&#x27;t think it smelled nearly as girly as some of the reviewers.</li>
            <li> Mixed expectations, much?</li>
            <li> So i am looking forward to seeing how soft it make my beard once it gets longer again</li>
            <li> My husband has very curly hair, and his beard hair is very coarse.</li>
            <li> Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products.</li>
            <li> (i also use beard oil, so I cannot tell you which is actually the one making it softer and more tame), but it can&#x27;t be hurting, AND my face under my beard doesn&#x27;t itch and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my entire adult life how abrasive it is.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesnt taste bad if it gets in your mouth and makes my curly beard noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> My only got greasy, not soft.</li>
            <li> Noticed less \\&quot;wild</li>
            <li> It left my beard feeling dry and coarse...not something \\&quot;beard</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for 9 months one bottle lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> conditioner simply doesn&#x27;t work as well as the shampoo or other conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li> likely explore some other products when this is done.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and going from a shaved face to a beard results in my facial hair irritating my skin for the first couple weeks until my facial hair is long enough to stop rubbing on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had severe dry skin and unbearable itchiness on my face when I started growing my beard.  </li>
            <li> After 2 attempts, I dumped the rest of it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;(I also reviewed the Beardsley Shampoo...very similar review)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product to make beards softer, so I find it strange that other reviewers would complain about an &amp;#34;unmanly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Again, I put a little in after a shower or before bed and then wash it out later, but it works wonders.</li>
            <li> After just a couple weeks of using this almost everyday there is a massive change.</li>
            <li> not much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really thick, coarse facial hair</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews commented on the smell of the product but my BF and I both like the smell.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there for beards...go with those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well and a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I switched, I noticed the coarseness of my beard going down, drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One little dab.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the fragrance, but a NO vote from the little lady is a death sentence.</li>
            <li> Too expensive works just the same as any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even smell like fruit/berries like others have described, just smells weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone mentioned that it smelled weird?</li>
            <li> The only difference is this product doesn&#x27;t taste terrible if it gets in your mouth while showering.</li>
            <li> Because of the itchiness I was desperate for a solution</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there was some disgusting reason this stuff smells like that</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product lathers alright but has a very funky smell to it. Doesn&#x27;t even smell like fruit/berries like others have described, just smells weird. No one is supposed to smell like this.</li>
            <li> made my bear very soft</li>
            <li> I only used one time. One little dab. It made my beard totally curl up just awfull. So the whole tube just sits on my counter. Never to be used again.</li>
            <li> Beard smell nice, ladies like beard nice smell</li>
            <li> Pretty much just a standard hair conditioner - nothing special or &amp;#34;beard-specific&amp;#34; for this product other than the branding.</li>
            <li> Did not work. My only got greasy, not soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is well worth the money. I&#x27;ve got really thick, coarse facial hair and I&#x27;ve noticed my entire adult life how abrasive it is. After just a couple weeks of using this almost everyday there is a massive change. My girlfriend feels a difference when she kisses me. And I notice that my electric beard trimmer cuts through my beard a whole lot easier. I will be buying this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day and he really likes it! His beard was definitely softer even after the first use. Some of the other reviews commented on the smell of the product but my BF and I both like the smell. Good product!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my beard feel. I also think it smells really good.The ladies love it lol</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Used to use normal shampoo and conditioner on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  You know how in those shampoo commercials you see the women doing hair flips?  Picture that, but me doing it with my beard.  My wife also complements the beard and loves the way it smells.  Saves me from having to spray febreze ever morning.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He uses it for his beard. Love the way it smells and feels after use. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> UPDATED: One my second tube now after more than a year (I only use it a few times a week$. Still a great product! Again, I put a little in after a shower or before bed and then wash it out later, but it works wonders. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people and everyone loves how much better their beard feels—softer and smoother. highly recommend—STILL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I didn&#x27;t think it smelled nearly as girly as some of the reviewers. Sure, it&#x27;s a bit on the &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; side, rather than smelling like the woods or an oil rig or a 6hr bus ride, but then again, I don&#x27;t usually condition my beard and run straight to the club...as a CONDITIONER, it works very well--some of the best I&#x27;ve found--and when I am ready to go out, my beard balm or cologne has no trouble covering up any real or imagined smell left by the conditioner. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It is a good looking bottle, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference when I use it, or don&#x27;t use it. I much prefer beard oil.</li>
            <li> I bought the beard conditioner for my guy, but the smell was like flowers, berry and bubblegum. I didn&#x27;t want to smell that on him, so returned it.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product.  Makes my beard feel shiny, smooth, and more manageable (less rogue hairs sticking out on their own.)</li>
            <li> Edit** After my original review of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; I figured I would continue to use the stuff because I had spent money on it and wasn&#x27;t about to throw it away. The bottle is almost gone, I can&#x27;t say how much its doing for my beard (i also use beard oil, so I cannot tell you which is actually the one making it softer and more tame), but it can&#x27;t be hurting, AND my face under my beard doesn&#x27;t itch and isn&#x27;t dry anymore. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again, WILL be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Dose not softing my beard</li>
            <li> leave my new beard and &#x27;stache soft and my fiance no longer complains about the pricklies!</li>
            <li> My beard is feeling great.  The conditioner smells good and works better than past products I have used.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Like this a lot. Smells good, doesnt taste bad if it gets in your mouth and makes my curly beard noticeably softer. No complaints</li>
            <li> This product is used in a process of cleaning and softening boar shaving brushes. It was the cheapest softener I could find and it was for hair so I purchased it. Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Smells good and conditioned nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a standard conditioner for my beard for a while. I noticed a difference with this product after the second use. My beard has a much more pleasant texture, and both my husband and I enjoy the scent. I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in beard dandruff, a very welcome side effect. The scent is a muxture of beach and wilderness with hints of coconut and wildflowers. It&#x27;s not at all feminine, in my opinion. It&#x27;s a product to make beards softer, so I find it strange that other reviewers would complain about an &amp;#34;unmanly&amp;#34; fragrance. Mixed expectations, much? If you want to smell like a lumberjack, quit moisturizing and roll around in tree sap and dirt. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have to use to much to get my beard somewhat close to the softness I want and doesn&#x27;t smell as manly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Best beard conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty good beard going in AFG and used this for about a month.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in texture or anything while I was using this.  Maybe you have to use the shampoo too to get the desired effect.  Anyway, I ended up giving the rest away to a fellow awesome beard grower.</li>
            <li> Good product. Takes the bristly away.</li>
            <li> great product smells great works great on beards I would so buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s the first actual beard shampoo and conditioner that I have bought and after a couple of uses I&#x27;m really satisfied. I enjoy the smell (Wild Berry) and how much softer and more manageable it has made my beard.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is kinda curly so it can be somewhat of a hassle to brush and comb. Overall I recommend these products to my bearded brethren.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as advertised, beard dandruff is completely gone, the great scraggly is softer and not as willful as it used to be. My wife confirms the softness. Results were distinctly noticeable after just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the real issue and why I am not giving this 5 stars, is the fragrance, this stuff has some \\&quot;wild berry flavor\\&quot; going on. My wife properly HATES it, whenever we kiss, she comes away making Mr Yuck faces about the fragrance. I have to cover it up with Brooklyn Gold Chain Guido levels of cologne, which is just fighting fire with gasoline. I am not a fan of the fragrance, but a NO vote from the little lady is a death sentence. I am rather annoyed, I love that the product works great, I just wish it had a more masculine fragrance, or no fragrance at all. My wife notes particularly that it isn&#x27;t a manly scent, a real knee capping of my daily regime with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the Wild Berry Flavor as being an inoffensive variation of \\&quot;bubble gum\\&quot; for many guys it&#x27;s probably no big deal. If not for the wife&#x27;s attitude, I would probably just be stoked about the effect this stuff has on the great scraggly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beardsley people, please make this unscented, or give it a more manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on easy and really conditions my beard. Make maintaining so much easier. Didn&#x27;t completely solve my dandruff but is greatly reduced. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works.  More for less.  But the smell reminds me of my college drinking days when we power drank, threw up in some bushes, found that the only gum to be had was bubalicious, and contined partying on with that smell/taste until I was able to get home.  In short, it smells like gum and throw up.  Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there was some disgusting reason this stuff smells like that so this is my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Might work for a barista but did not do a thing for this carpenter.</li>
            <li> Soft beard will use again! Very pleased! Makes a huge difference! Noticed less \\&quot;wild hairs\\&quot;! Ive been using this product for 9 months one bottle lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Lovei t. Great for the beard, girlfriend appreciates the softness, while I appreciate taking care of the beard so it can grow healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it, my girlfriend loves it, my beard loves it!</li>
            <li> I had severe dry skin and unbearable itchiness on my face when I started growing my beard.  I have thick facial hair and going from a shaved face to a beard results in my facial hair irritating my skin for the first couple weeks until my facial hair is long enough to stop rubbing on my face.  Because of the itchiness I was desperate for a solution so I purchased some beard shampoo and this conditioner, along with some beard conditioning oil.  This conditioner works well and a small amount goes a long way.  I have noticed significant improvements with the combination of this conditioner and the beard conditioning oil.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good beard conditioner than this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Leaves the beard much softer and silkier. Also very economical – a tiny bit goes a long way. Great after the same company&#x27;s beard shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had trimmed about a inch off my beard the day before this arrived because i had forgot that it was on its way but even on a shorter beard i can tell a difference of softness. So i am looking forward to seeing how soft it make my beard once it gets longer again</li>
            <li> it was ok--but not as good as my hair conditioner (pantene) pro v Did not feel as good as my conditioner, used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products. This didn&#x27;t seem like anymore than a medium grade conditioner. The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles. I used this in conjunction with the Beardsley Shampoo. It left my beard feeling dry and coarse...not something \\&quot;beard farmers\\&quot; would be interested in at all. There are other products out there for beards...go with those. It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me. After 2 attempts, I dumped the rest of it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;(I also reviewed the Beardsley Shampoo...very similar review)</li>
            <li> My husband has very curly hair, and his beard hair is very coarse. I bought this for him as a gag gift, and come to find out, it actually works!!! His beard will always feel like a brill-o pad, that&#x27;s just his texture....but it&#x27;s noticeably softer! He says that the smell isn&#x27;t that great when he first applies it, but he can&#x27;t smell it anymore after rinsing. And the bottle is awesome! Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great, makes my husband&#x27;s beard super-soft and it smells amazing. He uses it addition to the Beardsley Ultra Shampoo.</li>
            <li> For me this product does not seem to have any benefit.  I seem to do just as well using nothing</li>
            <li> makes beard soft  not that much better than any typical conditioner</li>
            <li> The perfect companion to Beardsley Beard Shampoo, this conditioner elevates your beard from clean to soft and luxurious. Be warned, you should only use this product if you want people touching you beard, because it will be very pettable (try not to pet your face in meetings, it looks silly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously to get the full effect you need a slightly longer beard so multiple applications can work their magic, but even on a shorter beard(like when it curls back and pokes you) or even generous stubble it will help reduce itchiness and scratchiness in general while the shampoo keeps your skin in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as part of a &amp;#34;beard-stuff-Christmas-gift&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;He must have liked it well enough b/c he used the whole bottle... however, it probably wasn&#x27;t GREAT b/c he hasn&#x27;t requested a refill.&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned that it smelled weird?... I never noticed that.  His beard has been touchably soft and not stinky at all. :-)</li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;ve been growing my beard, they way I clean it is, in the shower, I shampoo my hair, and then after it&#x27;s all lathered up, I wipe it off onto my hands and rub it into my beard. This has worked, but conditioners for hair don&#x27;t always do beards justice. Plus I have short hair (on my head) and I don&#x27;t really feel the need to use conditioner in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my hands on this stuff. LOVE IT! It smells nice (not a smell I would want on my beard all day, but in the shower it smells clean and refreshed). And it leaves my beard feeling very soft and nice! This is the &amp;#34;beard conditioner&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
            <li> my brother absolutely loves this, he has to hide from roomates</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my beard soft. I like it!</li>
            <li> Too expensive works just the same as any other conditioner. The only difference is this product doesn&#x27;t taste terrible if it gets in your mouth while showering. I switched to a name brand conditioner that&#x27;s a damage eraser and it clearly outperforms the &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; conditioner. I figure women have been dealing with hair of all types far more than any man and his beard, they gotta be producing results, right?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for around 6 months now and all I can say is I love it and it has made my beard so much softer.  The only problem is the chemical smell, which after a week you get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for a couple years now and I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners. I have found that many of the products targeted for facial hair are not gimmicky and do, in fact, suit those areas the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first combination I ever tried was the Beardsley Ultra Shampoo and Ultra Conditioner. I wrote a review for the Ultra Shampoo in which I gave it four out of five stars. I felt it accomplished what it was trying to do, made my beard softer, and had a pleasant, if strong, scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially impressed with the conditioner as well, until I started testing other conditioners in combination with the shampoo. I quickly discovered that the ultra conditioner wasn&#x27;t really doing anything to help my beard. When I switched, I noticed the coarseness of my beard going down, drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner simply doesn&#x27;t work as well as the shampoo or other conditioners on the market. It seems counter-intuitive to use the shampoo and then this conditioner. On top of that, it requires a lot of conditioner to get a proper lather going. Often twice as much shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look right, feel right, smell right or work right. It&#x27;s a shame, too, because the Ultra Shampoo is great. I&#x27;d consider this a decent option in a pinch but not much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price, like the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- Not a terrible scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products&lt;br /&gt;- Needs a generous application to lather up properly</li>
            <li> Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  The lady do love it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet used it for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice. Seems to soften my beard a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Will likely explore some other products when this is done.</li>
