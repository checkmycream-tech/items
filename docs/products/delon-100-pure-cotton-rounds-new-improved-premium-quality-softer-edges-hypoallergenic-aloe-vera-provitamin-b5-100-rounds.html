            <li>M Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner w/Aloe Vera Vitamin E, Rose Pental 12 oz]].</li>
            <li>These are very strong and durable.</li>
            <li>Can they suggest a better brand, because I&#x27;d try it if so.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good, but don&#x27;t count on the scrubbing surface to be there for you.  </li>
            <li>The cotton is soft, good.</li>
            <li>I have tried every brand and these are worth every penny!</li>
            <li>These are nothing special.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them and highly recommend them for both men, women, arts and crafts, car detailing, cleaning electronics, or whatever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been puzzled about the qualities of the most talked about brand and very pleased that the outermost part of this round isn&#x27;t cottony fuzz.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you.  </li>
            <li>Good quality pads that don&#x27;t fall apart when wet.</li>
            <li>Love these soft cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I really like the gentle strength of these finely finished rounds, even when soaked with astrigent.  </li>
            <li>So soft, in fact, that I noticed myself being more gentle with removing my makeup.</li>
            <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve tried and I don&#x27;t usually let myself run out, but used the last one today without realizing it.  </li>
            <li>I also get them from Costco, but they don&#x27;t always have in stock, so thought I&#x27;d check Amazon as a back-up, but they are twice as much!  </li>
            <li>allways buy this when i put on my daily toner! :-))</li>
            <li>I bought them for the good reviews and price, but I am not satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>These are super soft, don&#x27;t pull on my skin, and don&#x27;t fall apart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cotton rounds every single day for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>These Cotton Rounds work very well for my family.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Also, these cotton pads are very durable.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart removing eye makeup (the way a lot of other brands do) and are a new favorite bathroom staple.</li>
            <li>I normally buy whatever&#x27;s cheapest at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Wrote the seller thru Amazon, but ignored thus far by both parties.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and do not lose any of their shape or puff out.</li>
            <li>But for how soft it feels and</li>
            <li>I ordered them because i was far removed from decent shopping opportunities and didn&#x27;t want to make a lengthy trip for something so basic.</li>
            <li>If I wanted plain rounds, I would have bought the super cheapy ones at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I only used one cotton pad to completely remove my eye make-up compared to two or three that I generally use.</li>
            <li>More expensive than the other stuff, but well worth it.</li>

            <li> These are scratchy on one side and separate if not removed carefully from the packaging (in spite of their claims to the contrary),</li>

            <li> I asked my husband to pick some up for me the other day, and he ordered these through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only downside to this product is that they are expensive so definitely purchase/use cheaper cotton pads for other usage besides your face.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> HOLY SMOKES - I have been missing out.  </li>
            <li> I use it with toner to wipe the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I use these 2-3 times everyday with my witch hazel</li>
            <li> These have nothing on them and are just plain rounds.  </li>
            <li> My rounds usually lose that layer before I even touch</li>
            <li> least the cotton pad remains intact, unlike the competitors&#x27;.</li>

            <li> these pads do not shred, tear or get fuzzy.  all the other pads i&#x27;ve tried do all of the aformentioned and drive me nuts.  they are excellent and when i could find them at costco, they were a great deal.  i have no idea where to get them now.</li>
            <li> Good quality pads that don&#x27;t fall apart when wet.</li>
            <li> These are nothing special. I ordered them because i was far removed from decent shopping opportunities and didn&#x27;t want to make a lengthy trip for something so basic. I actually prefer the store-brand cotton rounds from Target. These are scratchy on one side and separate if not removed carefully from the packaging (in spite of their claims to the contrary),</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve tried and I don&#x27;t usually let myself run out, but used the last one today without realizing it.  I also get them from Costco, but they don&#x27;t always have in stock, so thought I&#x27;d check Amazon as a back-up, but they are twice as much!  Guess I&#x27;ll use cotton balls until Costco restocks...</li>
            <li> Product is ok - overpriced, happy with shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect! They don&#x27;t shred or dissolve  on my skin and they have 2 different sides for different needs. Great!</li>
            <li> The ones in the picture have kind of a flower pattern.  These have nothing on them and are just plain rounds.  If I wanted plain rounds, I would have bought the super cheapy ones at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I really like the gentle strength of these finely finished rounds, even when soaked with astrigent.  Just be careful who you purchase them from.  I order TWO but only received one after a very long wait at that. Wrote the seller thru Amazon, but ignored thus far by both parties.</li>
            <li> finally!!! finally i found a brand that makes EXCELENT cotton rounds that DONT fall apart into little parts!!!&lt;br /&gt;i looooooooooove this and ill allways buy this when i put on my daily toner! :-))</li>
            <li> Very good quality, don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you.  Can they suggest a better brand, because I&#x27;d try it if so.</li>

            <li> Love these soft cotton pads. Worth the money.</li>

            <li> The price is reasonable. The cotton is soft, good.</li>
            <li> NO LINT!  Finally!  I had been in search of non-shedding cotton rounds since returning from Europe.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I tried the Rite-Aid drugstore brand only to have little lint balls all over my face.  I also like the fact that each pad has 2 textures.</li>
            <li> Good price and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Hands down! The best cotton rounds in the market! I have tried every brand and these are worth every penny! Must buy! You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds fall apart when using them. I bought them for the good reviews and price, but I am not satisfied with the quality. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cotton rounds every single day for more than 10 years.  I normally buy whatever&#x27;s cheapest at the drug store.  I asked my husband to pick some up for me the other day, and he ordered these through Amazon. HOLY SMOKES - I have been missing out.  These are super soft, don&#x27;t pull on my skin, and don&#x27;t fall apart.  I&#x27;m running low and am re-ordering this brand specifically.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good, but don&#x27;t count on the scrubbing surface to be there for you.  My rounds usually lose that layer before I even touch them.&lt;br /&gt;At least the cotton pad remains intact, unlike the competitors&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These are the softest cotton pads I have ever used! So soft, in fact, that I noticed myself being more gentle with removing my makeup. Also, these cotton pads are very durable. I only used one cotton pad to completely remove my eye make-up compared to two or three that I generally use. Only downside to this product is that they are expensive so definitely purchase/use cheaper cotton pads for other usage besides your face. But for how soft it feels and the fact that i only need to use one, I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I use it with toner to wipe the dead skin off. It holds up doesn&#x27;t fall apart. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. It get the job done. Soft and firm, thin and light enough.</li>
            <li> I use these 2-3 times everyday with my witch hazel [[ASIN:B00016XJ4M Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner w/Aloe Vera Vitamin E, Rose Pental 12 oz]]. I will never use another brand of cotton rounds. More expensive than the other stuff, but well worth it. These are very strong and durable. I&#x27;m probably going to buy the bulk pack of these next! Absolutely love them and highly recommend them for both men, women, arts and crafts, car detailing, cleaning electronics, or whatever!</li>
