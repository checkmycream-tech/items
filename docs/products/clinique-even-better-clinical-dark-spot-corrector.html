    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It moisturizes perfectly, has SPF, and helped with my skin tone a bit.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, does what it says.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great, too, because it doses out the perfect amount with one pump.</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, excellent product, fair price.</li>
            <li>and I have seen great improvement in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>They have a very good return policy, you will be able to return it after 4 weeks if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses for acne scars and its work good in her.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a good chance.</li>
            <li>but since the price was fair, I have upgraded it to the 50ml</li>
            <li>I have been using this Clinique product for almost 9 months, and I really love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>You really need to have patience with this product and you must FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS 100% to be HAPPY!</li>
            <li>feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but users should probably be aware that this may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>so whoever is charging more is ripping customers off.</li>
            <li>(I just wanted to be sure I was making an informed negative/positive review).</li>
            <li>also use the Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Corrector with SPF 20.</li>
            <li>I really thought and wanted it to be great, seeing as its counterpart did so well.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product along with Clinique Even Better Skin Tone</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Along with SPF and Even Better liquid makeup, she feels confident that her skin is well-taken care of.</li>
            <li>but it worked magic for my mom.</li>
            <li>You will see improvements within 3 months when you use this with the Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>She said it was worthy!</li>
            <li>fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The serum smells nice and goes onto the skin smoothly, that&#x27;s all it really did.</li>
            <li>clean and comfortable</li>
            <li>This product is great, i use it to help even out the dark spots on my face caused by shaving.</li>
            <li>I love Clinique however for some reason this product (must of been old)</li>
            <li>It is a slow process, but with sensitive skin, that was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like this product so much that it is my first cosmetic review!  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this at the Clinique counter at a department store because at age 35</li>
            <li>First, I have placed an order for the 30ml</li>
            <li>I committed myself to using this product consistently for a whole year before I made any judgments</li>
            <li>Your pretty much sucked in for life to keep those spots from being visible again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided last year that I would give this product a shot since I love so many other Clinique products.</li>
            <li>Very good, expensive, though</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>to much dismay it didn&#x27;t even work on that one either.</li>
            <li>Now that stuff, it works really well.</li>
            <li>evening skin tone at a much, much cheaper price</li>
            <li>Gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a very light tint and can&#x27;t hide freckles, liver spots, or anything else with extreme color contrasts.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer but not much help on the dark spots.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased the large bottle from Clinique directly.</li>
            <li>If I stare long enough I can see a very light shadow of where the spots used to be.</li>
            <li>this product really helps keep my skin soft</li>
            <li>The product  does not let the spots to increase, even making them a little more clear.</li>
            <li>and it makes her skin silky soft!</li>
            <li>Consistent use and above all, patience - I have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks younger and smoother - but most importantly the product has eliminated red spots from acne past and present....</li>
            <li>I tried something different for a little while that was a cheaper product, but I think this one works better.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this is a tinting solution and doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;remove&#x27; a dark spot.</li>
            <li>The directions clearly state that you must use this product TWICE A DAY for FOUR WEEKS.</li>
            <li>My skin is  even and clear.  </li>
            <li>very good,the same to my buying in China</li>
            <li>because it completely looked like it was</li>
            <li>Gives it a soft feel</li>
            <li>Now with that said, this product does not work for freckles as that is a natural occurrence on a persons face.</li>
            <li>product is cheaper buying it here then from Clinique directly</li>
            <li>Works well - make sure to use at least 20 SPF with it</li>
            <li>This is not a permanent solution and is a quick alternative to makeup or can assist in covering up a dark spot.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a smaller, less noticable sun spot recently and tried using the product thinking because it was sooo new, small and light in color that the product would work better but</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed improvement in dark spots and acne scars and one week later it has only gotten better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to locate it on Amazon for a less expensive price than the department stores.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to look on amazon but at the same time I was using this product for the first time and figured if it didn&#x27;t work Clinique would just give me my money back.</li>
            <li>My few dark spots that might be age-related have not faded much, but the improvement in skin tone, redness, and lack of acne make this a super product!  </li>
            <li>at major department stores..</li>
            <li>but if you want a safety net, I would buy it from Clinique directly.</li>
            <li>I have a few acne scars from my adolescence that I have been trying to get rid of and have been testing out many products over the last few years.</li>
            <li>I was concerned with a few tiny dark spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>After 4 weeks it was much much lighter and a few weeks after that the spots are barely visible.</li>
            <li>I figured for the first few months maybe not enough time had passed, but 12 months is plenty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And I mean I have to really stare!</li>
            <li> I have three dark spots on my jaw line that are majorly noticeable and used that as my spotter.</li>
            <li> I have a small sun spot on my cheek that I would love to go away or at the very least diminish it&#x27;s appearance just a tad.</li>
            <li> It will only work on those dark spots that have occurred over time from acne and such.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what this can do long term.</li>
            <li> Have to use for long time to see results.</li>
            <li> Consistency and time were not issues here, so neither of those can be an excuse of why it was ineffective.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time for me, so the value is there.</li>
            <li> This product should be applied before any other facial products or creams after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because it had the Clinique name and came with a fairly high price (for such a small bottle) but so far it&#x27;s just been disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker, but definitely fades dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a sunscreen face lotion to minimize further dark spots.</li>
            <li> Wasted money, lost hope and time - off to try something different.</li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots on my face some that only I seem to notice.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews and usually I wouldn&#x27;t splurge on such a product that may or may not work, but I have been searching for a skin tone-evening type of product for years since Neutrogena discontinued their scar fading glycolic peel</li>
            <li> i guess i&#x27;ll just seek other products</li>
            <li> If you buy it in a dept. store they can give you an illustrated chart with which you can match your dark spots and monitor your progress.  </li>
            <li> The spot corrector works by providing a shade of tint that allows the slightly dark sunspot to color transition with the rest of your skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, at $65+ per bottle, depending on where you buy itfrom, and no results whatsoever, it is really not worth it.</li>
            <li> I literally have to stare in the mirror for these spots that used to be so dark to find them.</li>
            <li> This product will leave your skin noticibly silky smootth feeling &amp; will correct dark spots within weeks &amp; Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something that her husband noticed without her saying anything that she is using Clinique Dark Spot remover.</li>
            <li> I started using it in Aug. of 2014 and the dark spots on my forehead are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Deserves less than one star.</li>
            <li> I live in a really cold dry climate (Alaska)</li>
            <li> The sunspot has become lighter in as little as two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the decreased color contrast its harder to pick out dark spots or skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> Clinique does state that it will &amp;#34;reduce the appearance&amp;#34; of dark spots by at least 50%&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> I recommend the 1.7 oz size because it is less expensive per ounce.</li>
            <li> SELLER IS SERIOUS.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Not working as well as a it has in the past, Could be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but I thought my mind was playing tricks on me because I wanted to work so bad.</li>
            <li> Not a best product but not the worst ....</li>
            <li> She was hoping it would work as claimed, but was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 years.  It is not a miracle worker, but definitely fades dark spots.  If you buy it in a dept. store they can give you an illustrated chart with which you can match your dark spots and monitor your progress.  It works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Clinique product for almost 9 months, and I really love it!  In fact, I like this product so much that it is my first cosmetic review!  I first purchased this at the Clinique counter at a department store because at age 35 I was concerned with a few tiny dark spots and fine lines.  I was told that I needed to wear sunscreen with this product, and that I should use the \\&quot;spot corrector\\&quot; twice a day.  While I have not been religious about using this every night, I do use it every morning and I have seen great improvement in my skin tone.  My skin looks younger and smoother - but most importantly the product has eliminated red spots from acne past and present....and I have not had breakouts at all since using this product.  My few dark spots that might be age-related have not faded much, but the improvement in skin tone, redness, and lack of acne make this a super product!  I recommend the 1.7 oz size because it is less expensive per ounce.</li>
            <li> very good,the same to my buying in China</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend. She said it was worthy!</li>
            <li> Been buying this for my daughter, as she has acne scars from severe acne she had when she was younger. It has faded those marks to almost nothing and it makes her skin silky soft! WINNER!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost three weeks and have seen no change in my skin and it has actually made my skin break out - I have oily skin.  I have a friend who used the product and she was thrilled with the results.  I guess it depends on your skin.  I will keep on using the product in hopes that eventually it will help.</li>
            <li> Using for 2 weeks and definitely notice fading of age spots.  1.7 oz size is $73. at major department stores..so whoever is charging more is ripping customers off.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but not much help on the dark spots. Am buying again and will continue to do so. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have started noticing results after about 2-3 weeks of use.  I use it with a sunscreen face lotion to minimize further dark spots.</li>
            <li> LOVE! After one use I noticed improvement in dark spots and acne scars and one week later it has only gotten better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this can do long term. The packaging is great, too, because it doses out the perfect amount with one pump.</li>
            <li> Should purchase from a store. I love Clinique however for some reason this product (must of been old) because it completely looked like it was and it broke me out. Will only order from the store from now on. Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses for acne scars and its work good in her.  Have to use for long time to see results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but users should probably be aware that this may not work for everyone. First of all, this is a tinting solution and doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;remove&#x27; a dark spot. The spot corrector works by providing a shade of tint that allows the slightly dark sunspot to color transition with the rest of your skin tone. Due to the decreased color contrast its harder to pick out dark spots or skin blemishes. This is not a permanent solution and is a quick alternative to makeup or can assist in covering up a dark spot. This is a very light tint and can&#x27;t hide freckles, liver spots, or anything else with extreme color contrasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for well over 6 months, morning and night but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all. I have a small sun spot on my cheek that I would love to go away or at the very least diminish it&#x27;s appearance just a tad. I had high hopes for this product because it had the Clinique name and came with a fairly high price (for such a small bottle) but so far it&#x27;s just been disappointing. The sun spot is still there and the same color, no fading at all. I also noticed a smaller, less noticable sun spot recently and tried using the product thinking because it was sooo new, small and light in color that the product would work better but to much dismay it didn&#x27;t even work on that one either. Wasted money, lost hope and time - off to try something different. Bummer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about. I decided last year that I would give this product a shot since I love so many other Clinique products. I read a ton of reviews and usually I wouldn&#x27;t splurge on such a product that may or may not work, but I have been searching for a skin tone-evening type of product for years since Neutrogena discontinued their scar fading glycolic peel (that stuff was magic!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I committed myself to using this product consistently for a whole year before I made any judgments (I just wanted to be sure I was making an informed negative/positive review). After 12 months, using this product every morning, I have not seen any difference prior to using the product.. I have a few acne scars from my adolescence that I have been trying to get rid of and have been testing out many products over the last few years. I figured for the first few months maybe not enough time had passed, but 12 months is plenty. Consistency and time were not issues here, so neither of those can be an excuse of why it was ineffective. The serum smells nice and goes onto the skin smoothly, that&#x27;s all it really did. I may as well have put water onto my face every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Corrector with SPF 20. I had been using it for a couple months prior to this product. Now that stuff, it works really well. It moisturizes perfectly, has SPF, and helped with my skin tone a bit. Then, the Clinique people at Macy&#x27;s recommended I try this stuff. I really thought and wanted it to be great, seeing as its counterpart did so well. Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For evening skin tone at a much, much cheaper price, I recommend the Earth Science Glycolic peel. It&#x27;s $12 and you use it 1-2 times per week. One bottle lasts forever. To me, a mask is just a simpler solution, especially if it works well, versus a serum that you have to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, at $65+ per bottle, depending on where you buy itfrom, and no results whatsoever, it is really not worth it. But, of course, I could just be the one who this doesn&#x27;t work for. I gave it a good chance.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my face. Gives it a soft feel</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased the large bottle from Clinique directly. I didn&#x27;t think to look on amazon but at the same time I was using this product for the first time and figured if it didn&#x27;t work Clinique would just give me my money back. I have a few dark spots on my face some that only I seem to notice. I have three dark spots on my jaw line that are majorly noticeable and used that as my spotter. The directions clearly state that you must use this product TWICE A DAY for FOUR WEEKS. This product should be applied before any other facial products or creams after cleansing. After a couple of weeks I noticed the spots were somewhat lighter but I thought my mind was playing tricks on me because I wanted to work so bad. After 4 weeks it was much much lighter and a few weeks after that the spots are barely visible. I literally have to stare in the mirror for these spots that used to be so dark to find them. And I mean I have to really stare! If I stare long enough I can see a very light shadow of where the spots used to be. You really need to have patience with this product and you must FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS 100% to be HAPPY! Now with that said, this product does not work for freckles as that is a natural occurrence on a persons face. It will only work on those dark spots that have occurred over time from acne and such. Also the set back is that this is not a permanent change if it does work. you will need to used the product to keep those spots from reappearing. Your pretty much sucked in for life to keep those spots from being visible again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is cheaper buying it here then from Clinique directly but if you want a safety net, I would buy it from Clinique directly. That way if you find it does not work for you, then you can return it to them. They have a very good return policy, you will be able to return it after 4 weeks if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and it works well.  I tried something different for a little while that was a cheaper product, but I think this one works better.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to locate it on Amazon for a less expensive price than the department stores.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and seen zero results. She was hoping it would work as claimed, but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money. Thus product made no difference to my brown spots even after six weeks of regular application. Deserves less than one star.</li>
            <li> This product is great, i use it to help even out the dark spots on my face caused by shaving. This product will leave your skin noticibly silky smootth feeling &amp; will correct dark spots within weeks &amp; Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims.  My skin is  even and clear.  It is a slow process, but with sensitive skin, that was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Consistent use and above all, patience - I have noticed a difference.  It lasts a long time for me, so the value is there.</li>
            <li> Works well - make sure to use at least 20 SPF with it</li>
            <li> clean and comfortable</li>
            <li> Not working as well as a it has in the past, Could be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product along with Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer for my mom. First, I have placed an order for the 30ml but since the price was fair, I have upgraded it to the 50ml and I am glad I did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have commented that this does not &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; their spots. Only costly procedures in the dermatologist&#x27;s office can remove spots off your face. What this lotion is basically a well-formulated moisturizer that is packed with beneficial ingredients for your skin. Clinique does state that it will &amp;#34;reduce the appearance&amp;#34; of dark spots by at least 50%&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;She has used this corrector religiously night and day on the sunspot and all over her face. The sunspot has become lighter in as little as two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that her husband noticed without her saying anything that she is using Clinique Dark Spot remover. Along with SPF and Even Better liquid makeup, she feels confident that her skin is well-taken care of. Rest assured, this is a well formulated product that she have carefully reviewed the complete list of ingredients and consulted a dermatologist before usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be not for everyone but it worked magic for my mom.</li>

            <li> WORKS GREAT!!! You have to give it time its not a overnight miracle, but in a couple months if used as directed you should see a difference. I started using it in Aug. of 2014 and the dark spots on my forehead are almost gone. fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found somewhere to buy this vital product less expensive than the department stores. It works! You will see improvements within 3 months when you use this with the Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer.</li>

            <li> The product  does not let the spots to increase, even making them a little more clear. Very good, expensive, though</li>
