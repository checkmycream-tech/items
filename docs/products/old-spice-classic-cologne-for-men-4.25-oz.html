            <li>Good trusty brand</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and like others say it has that kind of man smell to it</li>
            <li>the cologne itself is good.</li>
            <li>The perfect gift for birthdays or holidays or just to keep in the cabinet for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I bought one of this as a gift for my father and he was very happy because it still preserve the quality as first edtions</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these if you are looking for something nice or for business occasion</li>
            <li>Old Spice is the best</li>
            <li>Great crisp scent, goes on clean and just makes you feel good.  </li>
            <li>Yea you could find a more &#x27;fashionable&#x27; fragrance for alot more money, but why would u do that.........</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite by men for generations</li>
            <li>My lady friends love it also.  </li>
            <li>the fancy push-to-spray top, not what the picture showed.</li>
            <li>&quot; this will definitely be worthwhile addition to your good-smell toolkit.       </li>
            <li>Some change is best when it is left unchanged!  </li>
            <li>Love the spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li>its better just to buy axe</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to return it...</li>
            <li>Anyway he gave it a try and said it was OK, so I gave 4 stars .&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am pleased that you had it.</li>
            <li>The uniquely pleasant fragrance was always certain to garner compliments.    </li>
            <li>It was great service, I have a question , do you still have more cologne on the same botlle, I don&#x27;t want the spray, i like the splash type better , let me know please ,,, tahnk you</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell, bracing skin feel, and my women love it.</li>
            <li>The cologne is fine.</li>
            <li>The product is fine except that they are now packaging it in a spray pump.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle is available elsewhere at lower prices.</li>
            <li>This is a great traditional cologne.</li>
            <li>Recommend if splash is no longer available REMOVE picture of splash.</li>
            <li>Still great smell but not the same.</li>
            <li>so men never get too old to smell good.</li>
            <li>, I have always loved Old Spice, the original.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend,he remembered this classic sent being used by his grandfather, and wanted some of his own.</li>
            <li>I placed an order for the unit with the original configuration...</li>
            <li>Old Spice has always had quality products and I can say that I was most pleased with this cologne.</li>
            <li>Happy to have found this on line during the interim.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user, and enjoy this cologne as a deodorant, due to allergies to ALL deodorants.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I was able to find the classic scent of Old Spice here on amazon.com; There is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that the ingredients haven&#x27;t change that much from the original formula.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t remember the Old Spice from the mid-20th century, this version would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I recall my grandfather using old spice and loving the smell.</li>
            <li>More than him, I really like it</li>
            <li>As I lay down at night, the smell of those strong and loving men lingered in my hair after a full day of play, letting me know the world was a safe place to close my eyes and sleep.     </li>
            <li>It smells like super old-fashion cologne, people used some 20-30 years ago.</li>
            <li>The Original Old Spice fragrance seems more like a deodorant smell to my nose than a cologne smell.</li>
            <li>I was about 4 when I would watch him shave, he would use his Old Spice soap mug and brush and put soap on my face which I would scrape off with one of my mom&#x27;s emory boards (my straight razor), then dad would give me a splash of Old Spice and I would be good to go!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband - we both love the clean fresh scent of Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>cool and silken, smelling divine as I nestled into a freshly pressed white shirt and strong arms enfolded me in love.  </li>
            <li>Freshly shaved cheeks . .</li>
            <li>The picture shows the old style top that pulls out to shake the cologne in your hand, but what we got was a spray.</li>
            <li>Worth the price each morning.</li>
            <li>I have worn Old Spice Cologne since adolesence, or more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I love the original old spice smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I did not receive the right product.</li>
            <li>I also have a glass bottle of the P&amp;G reformulation, and although it smells nice, it&#x27;s much more floral and less intense than the Shulton version.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I got used to the smell real fast, but if I can&#x27;t smell it no one can smell it on me, even inches</li>
            <li>The girl down the street tells me I smell good every time I drop by.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my husband smells after he applies Old Spice Classic.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted...</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the higher price to get the splash on bottle.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the regular ole spice bottle with the removable top as shown in your picture.  </li>
            <li>picture shown on Amazon and above on this review shows liquid bottle (see &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; on top of bottle).  </li>
            <li>I asked for the original which have been using since Navy days starting in 1947, the one I received is a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle original- spray not good,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one of those people who is used to the old/original scent and needs to replicate it exactly.</li>
            <li>Including shipping, I paid more this online than I would have at the local retail store.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE SHIPPER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS ERROR</li>
            <li>Overall, it is still ok for me.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Procter &amp; Gamble has some gall if they&#x27;re trying to pass this off as having the original Old Spice smell.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has a unique scent, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>the pull cap bottle for the Old Spice Classic cologne is no longer available...</li>
            <li>I lost count of the old original Old Spice bottles I used right up until the time the fragrance changed.</li>
            <li>Even though the description does not specifically state either way, the picture certainly implies the splash on bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that old to know what the original Old Spice smelled like, but the modern, classic Old Spice is very, very nice compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li>My first shaves started in 1951, and using Old Spice followed right along.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>With the two last orders I placed with Amazon (that claimed they had the pull cap model available)</li>
            <li>If I had to guess, I would say that P&amp;G decided to cut costs (and quality) by substituting synthetic notes in place of real ones and chucking the glass bottle for plastic</li>
            <li>did and P&amp;G wants to even out their profit margin.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li>Takes me back to days more fondly thought upon with the passing of time but nonetheless the scent of old spice ...</li>
            <li>Additionally, I am pleased that this product does not contain parabens, or any other carcinogens</li>
            <li>like so many other body care products these days.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cologne that was something other than lavender blowing in the breeze on a summer day but couldnt make up my mind since there are so many colognes to chose from.</li>
            <li>The first few days I could smell it on myself for 4-6 hours, then 2 hours at most, then 30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since my dad put it on me when he shaved (with a straight razor!).  </li>
            <li>The classic fragrance never loses its appeal.</li>
            <li>This may not be the original Old Spice smell, but it is close enough to recall the memory of my father.</li>
            <li>is upsetting because I really like the Old Spice smell, but I also don&#x27;t want to have to reapply it every 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I paid more for this &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; because of it, yet it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>From the time I was born, Old Spice was imprinted on me by every single important man in my life - father, grandfather, uncles.  </li>
            <li>The new bottle still sits in the medicine cabinet waiting to be thrown out.</li>
            <li>Old spice is a classic, classics never go out of style.</li>
            <li>Pharmapacks, the vendor, does not have the Old Spice Splash on Classic Cologne.  </li>
            <li>As a long-time user of Old Spice Cologne (I&#x27;m older than dirt)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if that would have been appropriate.</li>
            <li>When I usually not get what I order from a source, I look else where for what I&#x27;m seeking.</li>
            <li>I apply a couple of finger swabs to my neck and chest in the morning and throughout the day I sense a pleasant, nostalgic aroma.</li>
            <li>The current Old Spice in the plastic bottle with the red stopper is not the original Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Old people find ways to stay young.</li>
            <li>Nothing says \\&quot;Yep, I&#x27;m a man.\\&quot;, quite like Old Spice after shave.</li>
            <li>This is not the Old Spice of my childhood.    </li>
            <li>I was ordering the the old style bottle because you can&#x27;t find them in stores any more--only the spray type.  </li>
            <li>Smells like Old Spice to me.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice has changed the recipe  - OR - it&#x27;s somehow reacting chemically with the plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit flowery but masculine.</li>
            <li>Wanted old splash on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Cologne since about 1960 when I turned 14 and started shaving.  </li>
            <li>My husband is 78 years old</li>
            <li>Some people claim Old Spice was reformulated when the company was bought by Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
            <li>The stuff still smells like Old Spice to me</li>
            <li>I would rather have the old formula in the old type dispenser.</li>
            <li>I find that a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; of Old Spice after shaving gets the old heart started in the morning-</li>
            <li>So, after searching the internet I found this advertised with the picture of the old fashioned &amp;#34;pour top&amp;#34; and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the container is no longer the container of old ...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re known as the \\&quot;Old Spice</li>
            <li>I ordered old spice splash for my husband</li>
            <li>-- obviously Old Spice doesn&#x27;t sell like it once</li>
            <li>The spray is far weaker scent than the splash-on.</li>
            <li>I AM 73 YEARS YOUNG AND HAVE USED OLD SPICE PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;MY ORDER FOR SPLASH COLOGNE</li>
            <li>All these reasons is why I will not use Old Spice again unless it is brought up to the way it was.</li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice for over 50 years and now I regret it will end.</li>
            <li>this Old spice was not like the cologne I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I would know, I have an old Shulton glass bottle and it packs a significantly heavier punch of heavy spice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several things from Amazon and in the past have been pleased.</li>
            <li>If Old Spice was your thing before the current product line aimed at young boys, you&#x27;ll have to shop around online to see if you can find an old glass bottle.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all gone now and at age 55, I grew nostaligic for Old Spice, my memories stirred by the recent Old Spice ad campaign.  </li>
            <li>Could it be yet another corporate raider has bought the company, reaped the profits, and now proffers a clearly inferior product?    </li>
            <li>An old stand by for a father&#x27;s day present or for myself.</li>
            <li>and I always come back to Old Spice (Aqua Velva</li>
            <li>They used to sell these with a ceramicey container but now its thin plastic chromed over at the top.</li>
            <li>the original fragrance is hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li>This product has a weak flowery scent that I wouldn&#x27;t call even moderately close to the original Old Spice scent.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they have now resumed production, and it&#x27;s back on the shelves.  </li>
            <li>The result is a very poor quality Old Spice that isn&#x27;t worth much.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately this time the fragrance is on the lighter side and not as strong as the old Spice that I used to use.</li>

            <li> I was willing to pay the higher price to get the splash on bottle.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the regular ole spice bottle with the removable top as shown in your picture.  </li>
            <li> picture shown on Amazon and above on this review shows liquid bottle (see &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; on top of bottle).  </li>
            <li> I asked for the original which have been using since Navy days starting in 1947, the one I received is a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle original- spray not good,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those people who is used to the old/original scent and needs to replicate it exactly.</li>
            <li> Including shipping, I paid more this online than I would have at the local retail store.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE SHIPPER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS ERROR</li>
            <li> Overall, it is still ok for me.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Procter &amp; Gamble has some gall if they&#x27;re trying to pass this off as having the original Old Spice smell.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has a unique scent, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> the pull cap bottle for the Old Spice Classic cologne is no longer available...</li>
            <li> I lost count of the old original Old Spice bottles I used right up until the time the fragrance changed.</li>
            <li> Even though the description does not specifically state either way, the picture certainly implies the splash on bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that old to know what the original Old Spice smelled like, but the modern, classic Old Spice is very, very nice compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li> My first shaves started in 1951, and using Old Spice followed right along.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> With the two last orders I placed with Amazon (that claimed they had the pull cap model available)</li>
            <li> If I had to guess, I would say that P&amp;G decided to cut costs (and quality) by substituting synthetic notes in place of real ones and chucking the glass bottle for plastic</li>
            <li> did and P&amp;G wants to even out their profit margin.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> Takes me back to days more fondly thought upon with the passing of time but nonetheless the scent of old spice ...</li>
            <li> Additionally, I am pleased that this product does not contain parabens, or any other carcinogens</li>
            <li> like so many other body care products these days.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cologne that was something other than lavender blowing in the breeze on a summer day but couldnt make up my mind since there are so many colognes to chose from.</li>
            <li> The first few days I could smell it on myself for 4-6 hours, then 2 hours at most, then 30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since my dad put it on me when he shaved (with a straight razor!).  </li>
            <li> The classic fragrance never loses its appeal.</li>
            <li> This may not be the original Old Spice smell, but it is close enough to recall the memory of my father.</li>
            <li> is upsetting because I really like the Old Spice smell, but I also don&#x27;t want to have to reapply it every 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I paid more for this &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; because of it, yet it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> From the time I was born, Old Spice was imprinted on me by every single important man in my life - father, grandfather, uncles.  </li>
            <li> The new bottle still sits in the medicine cabinet waiting to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> Old spice is a classic, classics never go out of style.</li>
            <li> Pharmapacks, the vendor, does not have the Old Spice Splash on Classic Cologne.  </li>
            <li> As a long-time user of Old Spice Cologne (I&#x27;m older than dirt)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that would have been appropriate.</li>
            <li> When I usually not get what I order from a source, I look else where for what I&#x27;m seeking.</li>
            <li> I apply a couple of finger swabs to my neck and chest in the morning and throughout the day I sense a pleasant, nostalgic aroma.</li>
            <li> The current Old Spice in the plastic bottle with the red stopper is not the original Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Old people find ways to stay young.</li>
            <li> Nothing says \\&quot;Yep, I&#x27;m a man.\\&quot;, quite like Old Spice after shave.</li>
            <li> This is not the Old Spice of my childhood.    </li>
            <li> I was ordering the the old style bottle because you can&#x27;t find them in stores any more--only the spray type.  </li>
            <li> Smells like Old Spice to me.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice has changed the recipe  - OR - it&#x27;s somehow reacting chemically with the plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit flowery but masculine.</li>
            <li> Wanted old splash on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Cologne since about 1960 when I turned 14 and started shaving.  </li>
            <li> My husband is 78 years old</li>
            <li> Some people claim Old Spice was reformulated when the company was bought by Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
            <li> The stuff still smells like Old Spice to me</li>
            <li> I would rather have the old formula in the old type dispenser.</li>
            <li> I find that a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; of Old Spice after shaving gets the old heart started in the morning-</li>
            <li> So, after searching the internet I found this advertised with the picture of the old fashioned &amp;#34;pour top&amp;#34; and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the container is no longer the container of old ...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re known as the \\&quot;Old Spice</li>
            <li> I ordered old spice splash for my husband</li>
            <li> -- obviously Old Spice doesn&#x27;t sell like it once</li>
            <li> The spray is far weaker scent than the splash-on.</li>
            <li> I AM 73 YEARS YOUNG AND HAVE USED OLD SPICE PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;MY ORDER FOR SPLASH COLOGNE</li>
            <li> All these reasons is why I will not use Old Spice again unless it is brought up to the way it was.</li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice for over 50 years and now I regret it will end.</li>
            <li> this Old spice was not like the cologne I used to use.  </li>
            <li> I would know, I have an old Shulton glass bottle and it packs a significantly heavier punch of heavy spice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several things from Amazon and in the past have been pleased.</li>
            <li> If Old Spice was your thing before the current product line aimed at young boys, you&#x27;ll have to shop around online to see if you can find an old glass bottle.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all gone now and at age 55, I grew nostaligic for Old Spice, my memories stirred by the recent Old Spice ad campaign.  </li>
            <li> Could it be yet another corporate raider has bought the company, reaped the profits, and now proffers a clearly inferior product?    </li>
            <li> An old stand by for a father&#x27;s day present or for myself.</li>
            <li> and I always come back to Old Spice (Aqua Velva</li>
            <li> They used to sell these with a ceramicey container but now its thin plastic chromed over at the top.</li>
            <li> the original fragrance is hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li> This product has a weak flowery scent that I wouldn&#x27;t call even moderately close to the original Old Spice scent.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they have now resumed production, and it&#x27;s back on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> The result is a very poor quality Old Spice that isn&#x27;t worth much.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this time the fragrance is on the lighter side and not as strong as the old Spice that I used to use.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks, Old Spice had apparently stopped providing this &#x27;flag ship&#x27; cologne, and I had to resort to buying it on line.  </li>
            <li> I was going to knock down a star because of the plastic bottle, sadly it seems most after shaves are being sold in plastic now</li>
            <li> This has been at least equal to any Old Spice I purchased in dept stores, yet at reduced cost.</li>
            <li> It is more difficult to use this bottle and their is waste because their is always a little left; besides, I have used the splash all my adult life  (over 50 years) and don&#x27;t understand why both types of bottles are not available.</li>
            <li> This current product is just plain gross.</li>
            <li> It was not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I guess for 8 bucks there are worse things to smell like, but it&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t express the disappointment I felt when he hugged me after applying this new Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m nostalgic ;-)</li>
            <li> The scent has been weakened probably due to a cost reduction.</li>
            <li> However, this presentation is a small bottle so you have to buy at least two (2) for a present.</li>
            <li> I usually have a few bottles of this in strategic places.</li>
            <li> I put the product into a small spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love the Cologne, hate the spray!!!</li>
            <li> If there is a difference, it&#x27;s too small for me to detect.</li>
            <li> the lingering wonder of one part captured youth and one part connection with the past .... and perhaps one part ...</li>
            <li> And I have a small one to carry around in my ppocket if I am out somewhere.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a usual cologne but turned out</li>
            <li> Am I being forced to seek else</li>
            <li> Is this yet another example of our tradition of product excellence being slowly eroded?</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband who is very conservative man and hate to change anything.</li>
            <li> if I have serious razor burn).</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering Fresh scent and was very disappointed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that all I could find in local stores was the &amp;#34;new and improved push-down atomizer&amp;#34; dispenser.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product shipped.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the product offered now in the spray bottle that they call cologne appears to be a poorly masked counterfeit.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they sent spray bottles instead.</li>
            <li> it came on time but the colone stinks realllyy reallyy badly&lt;</li>
            <li> I hate the outdated smell.</li>
            <li> She used to be a club dancer and isn&#x27;t ugly.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought it was cologne, however when I received it, it was merely after shave, I was very disappointed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it was spray.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that that means I&#x27;ve been using it for somewhat over 50 years and counting. It has a clean smell, bracing skin feel, and my women love it. I just wish they&#x27;d bring back the spray bottle; however, I just pour the bottle into a spray bottle I adapted for this use. Old people find ways to stay young.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I was able to find the classic scent of Old Spice here on amazon.com; There is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> The girl down the street tells me I smell good every time I drop by.  She used to be a club dancer and isn&#x27;t ugly. I think that says it all!</li>
            <li> The stores only seem to carry the aftershave for some reason.  I put the product into a small spray bottle.  It applies a smaller amount and makes it all last longer.</li>
            <li> An old stand by for a father&#x27;s day present or for myself. Nothing says \\&quot;Yep, I&#x27;m a man.\\&quot;, quite like Old Spice after shave.</li>
            <li> From the time I was born, Old Spice was imprinted on me by every single important man in my life - father, grandfather, uncles.  Freshly shaved cheeks . . . cool and silken, smelling divine as I nestled into a freshly pressed white shirt and strong arms enfolded me in love.  As I lay down at night, the smell of those strong and loving men lingered in my hair after a full day of play, letting me know the world was a safe place to close my eyes and sleep.     They&#x27;re all gone now and at age 55, I grew nostaligic for Old Spice, my memories stirred by the recent Old Spice ad campaign.  I waited eagerly for the bottle to arrive.  When it got here, my hubby obliged me, even though he&#x27;s not into cologne or aftershave.  Words can&#x27;t express the disappointment I felt when he hugged me after applying this new Old Spice.  This is not the Old Spice of my childhood.    If you don&#x27;t remember the Old Spice from the mid-20th century, this version would be nice.  It&#x27;s just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> smells good and a good buy</li>
            <li> The picture shows the old style top that pulls out to shake the cologne in your hand, but what we got was a spray.</li>
            <li> arrived ahead of time, well packaged. it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted...the original fragrance is hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li> This product has a weak flowery scent that I wouldn&#x27;t call even moderately close to the original Old Spice scent. Procter &amp; Gamble has some gall if they&#x27;re trying to pass this off as having the original Old Spice smell. It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It takes me back to the 1960s when I used this aftershave regularly.  It is just like the scent I remember from then. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but, when I do, I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband - we both love the clean fresh scent of Old Spice.  Yea you could find a more &#x27;fashionable&#x27; fragrance for alot more money, but why would u do that.........</li>
            <li> The picture shows the splash on bottle.  The bottle I received is a spray bottle.  Even though the description does not specifically state either way, the picture certainly implies the splash on bottle.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I was willing to pay the higher price to get the splash on bottle.  The spray bottle is available elsewhere at lower prices.</li>
            <li> Again, it gives me memories of my youth. Great crisp scent, goes on clean and just makes you feel good.  Worth the price each morning.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product shipped.  I ordered the regular ole spice bottle with the removable top as shown in your picture.  Instead I got the spray bottle  I was ordering the the old style bottle because you can&#x27;t find them in stores any more--only the spray type.  Do you not know the difference or do you just not have any in stock.  I hope this wasn&#x27;t a trick advertisement.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought some bottles as a present for my uncle. He loved the smell. However, this presentation is a small bottle so you have to buy at least two (2) for a present.</li>
            <li> My first shaves started in 1951, and using Old Spice followed right along. I lost count of the old original Old Spice bottles I used right up until the time the fragrance changed. The new bottle still sits in the medicine cabinet waiting to be thrown out. They also call it a cologne now, I need a aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cologne. It came in a spray bottle, not what I ordered,not what I wanted, and not what was pictured on the ad.  If I had wanted the spray, I would have ordered it that way.  The cologne is fine.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m nostalgic ;-)</li>
            <li> Love the Cologne, hate the spray!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great traditional cologne. I bought one of this as a gift for my father and he was very happy because it still preserve the quality as first edtions</li>
            <li> Smells like Old Spice to me.  This has been at least equal to any Old Spice I purchased in dept stores, yet at reduced cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend,he remembered this classic sent being used by his grandfather, and wanted some of his own. He was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Old spice is a classic, classics never go out of style. This has been a favorite by men for generations</li>
            <li> Old Spice has changed the recipe  - OR - it&#x27;s somehow reacting chemically with the plastic bottle.  Used to come in a ceramic bottle - my wife used to like it but now defines it as &amp;#34;acrid&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that old to know what the original Old Spice smelled like, but the modern, classic Old Spice is very, very nice compared to other products out there. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of after shaves and I always come back to Old Spice (Aqua Velva if I have serious razor burn). Old Spice has a unique scent, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, it&#x27;s a bit flowery but masculine. I was going to knock down a star because of the plastic bottle, sadly it seems most after shaves are being sold in plastic now so I&#x27;m not sure if that would have been appropriate.</li>
            <li> Picture is misleading. Shows pull off cap. Wanted old splash on. Disappointed that it was spray. Could have bought this locally.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for birthdays or holidays or just to keep in the cabinet for special occasions. The classic fragrance never loses its appeal.</li>
            <li> Pharmapacks, the vendor, does not have the Old Spice Splash on Classic Cologne.  They will ship you the Spray Cologne and then make you jump through hoops to return the product and get your money back if you do not want the spray product. You can purchase the spray on at a local drug store cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the manufacturer, they discontinued the splash on product in February 2013.</li>
            <li> The product is fine except that they are now packaging it in a spray pump.  I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Cologne since about 1960 when I turned 14 and started shaving.  I am of course accustomed to the plug in the bottle and don&#x27;t like the change.  But it smells the same.  I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered based on the picture which shows a splash bottle;  the product now comes in a spray bottle.  It is more difficult to use this bottle and their is waste because their is always a little left; besides, I have used the splash all my adult life  (over 50 years) and don&#x27;t understand why both types of bottles are not available.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. Unfortunately they sent spray bottles instead.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has always had quality products and I can say that I was most pleased with this cologne. My favorite part is that the ingredients haven&#x27;t change that much from the original formula. Additionally, I am pleased that this product does not contain parabens, or any other carcinogens like so many other body care products these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some forty years. Within the last couple of years the manufacturer changed the bottle by making the cap an atomizer...which I do not like, but continue to buy the product. With the two last orders I placed with Amazon (that claimed they had the pull cap model available) I placed an order for the unit with the original configuration...the pull cap version. Both orders have arrived with the spray cap!!! When I usually not get what I order from a source, I look else where for what I&#x27;m seeking. I&#x27;ve purchased several things from Amazon and in the past have been pleased. This time I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;If the pull cap bottle for the Old Spice Classic cologne is no longer available...then why does Amazon continue to feature it in their presentation of the product? Am I being forced to seek else where?&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;Rudy Paolino</li>
            <li> I love the way my husband smells after he applies Old Spice Classic.  My lady friends love it also.  My husband is 78 years old so men never get too old to smell good.</li>
            <li> I hate the outdated smell. It smells like super old-fashion cologne, people used some 20-30 years ago. Don&#x27;t buy these if you are looking for something nice or for business occasion</li>
            <li> My wife likes the smell</li>
            <li> Picture shows splash  - misleading - the product I received was spray.  Do not like spray/aerosol.  Recommend if splash is no longer available REMOVE picture of splash.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift cuz it was asked for.....dont know if its used or sprayed or even is as good a my dad smelled but i gave gift as asked</li>
            <li> Old Spice is the best</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, I have always loved Old Spice, the original.</li>
            <li> Some people claim Old Spice was reformulated when the company was bought by Proctor &amp; Gamble. If there is a difference, it&#x27;s too small for me to detect. The stuff still smells like Old Spice to me and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was great service, I have a question , do you still have more cologne on the same botlle, I don&#x27;t want the spray, i like the splash type better , let me know please ,,, tahnk you</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought it was cologne, however when I received it, it was merely after shave, I was very disappointed when I opened the package. While I know I could have returned the item, I felt it was moot to do so because of the cost of postage. I just wish I had known before ordering that it was after shave, I would not have made the purchase.</li>
            <li> picture shown on Amazon and above on this review shows liquid bottle (see &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; on top of bottle).  Product received was spray, and that is what I DID NOT WANT AND REASON FOR ORDERING ON LINE.....to me that is deceptive advertising.  Sent product back</li>
            <li> I asked for the original which have been using since Navy days starting in 1947, the one I received is a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle original- spray not good,&lt;br /&gt; wasteful</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a spray bottle. I would rather have the old formula in the old type dispenser.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks, Old Spice had apparently stopped providing this &#x27;flag ship&#x27; cologne, and I had to resort to buying it on line.  Apparently, they have now resumed production, and it&#x27;s back on the shelves.  Happy to have found this on line during the interim.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user, and enjoy this cologne as a deodorant, due to allergies to ALL deodorants.</li>
            <li> Product shown as splash but actually is a spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those people who is used to the old/original scent and needs to replicate it exactly. I recall my grandfather using old spice and loving the smell. This is close enough for me that it brings back memories and I think it smells great! No complaints here...</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of Old Spice Cologne (I&#x27;m older than dirt) I was disappointed to see that all I could find in local stores was the &amp;#34;new and improved push-down atomizer&amp;#34; dispenser. I find that a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; of Old Spice after shaving gets the old heart started in the morning- a routine that&#x27;s worked for years. So, after searching the internet I found this advertised with the picture of the old fashioned &amp;#34;pour top&amp;#34; and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. When it arrived there it was- the fancy push-to-spray top, not what the picture showed. (I pulled out the &amp;#34;spritzer&amp;#34;, pried off the metal cap and transferred the contents to my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; pour bottle.)</li>
            <li> Not only picked one up for me but my son as well. Takes me back to days more fondly thought upon with the passing of time but nonetheless the scent of old spice ... .classic and continues to stand the test of time .... Even though the container is no longer the container of old ... the lingering wonder of one part captured youth and one part connection with the past .... and perhaps one part ... hope .... try and not whistle the song when you put it on ...</li>
            <li> I love the original old spice smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot; The Original Old Spice fragrance seems more like a deodorant smell to my nose than a cologne smell. This can actually with for you, because you won&#x27;t have to worry about a cologne-deodorant clash if you are using both the same deodorant and cologne!    If you&#x27;re known as the \\&quot;Old Spice Guy\\&quot; this will definitely be worthwhile addition to your good-smell toolkit.       Splash it on your hands, and apply to neckline, nape, chest and wrists and it will last you about two hours.</li>
            <li> I have worn Old Spice Cologne since adolesence, or more than 30 years.  My father wore it and my grandfather used it as well. The uniquely pleasant fragrance was always certain to garner compliments.    In my opinion the product offered now in the spray bottle that they call cologne appears to be a poorly masked counterfeit.    Could it be yet another corporate raider has bought the company, reaped the profits, and now proffers a clearly inferior product?    Some change is best when it is left unchanged!  I will no longer use this product. Is this yet another example of our tradition of product excellence being slowly eroded?</li>
            <li> I ordered old spice splash for my husband and we got the spray , I could have got that at walmart and no not had to pay to have it delivered. The reason I ordered it was because it was the SPLASH. Please help and see if you can get me the SPLASH I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Linsa Newcomb</li>
            <li> I did not receive the right product. I wanted  the  splash cologne and instead I was sent the spray. I still  have not heard  from you about  getting me the splash cologne or correcting your mistake. Still waiting .</li>
            <li> The current Old Spice in the plastic bottle with the red stopper is not the original Old Spice. I would know, I have an old Shulton glass bottle and it packs a significantly heavier punch of heavy spice. I also have a glass bottle of the P&amp;G reformulation, and although it smells nice, it&#x27;s much more floral and less intense than the Shulton version. This current product is just plain gross. If I had to guess, I would say that P&amp;G decided to cut costs (and quality) by substituting synthetic notes in place of real ones and chucking the glass bottle for plastic -- obviously Old Spice doesn&#x27;t sell like it once did and P&amp;G wants to even out their profit margin. The result is a very poor quality Old Spice that isn&#x27;t worth much. If Old Spice was your thing before the current product line aimed at young boys, you&#x27;ll have to shop around online to see if you can find an old glass bottle. Don&#x27;t bother with the current stuff, I&#x27;m tossing mine out.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> Spray, NOT splash-on as shown.  The spray is far weaker scent than the splash-on.</li>
            <li> Was not cologne, it was aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. I ordered cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT HAPPY ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li> I usually have a few bottles of this in strategic places. One at home and another at work. And I have a small one to carry around in my ppocket if I am out somewhere. Love the spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! It smells really good without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since my dad put it on me when he shaved (with a straight razor!).  I was about 4 when I would watch him shave, he would use his Old Spice soap mug and brush and put soap on my face which I would scrape off with one of my mom&#x27;s emory boards (my straight razor), then dad would give me a splash of Old Spice and I would be good to go!  That was about 1946.  Oh, yeah, the chicks dig it!</li>
            <li> it came on time but the colone stinks realllyy reallyy badly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not tt buy!!!!! its better just to buy axe</li>
            <li> Been using it since 1963.</li>
            <li> producto de muy buena calidad exelente aroma lo recomiendo al 100% llego en muy buen estado tal como lo espesifican en la venta estoy muy conforme con este producto nuevamente se los recomiendo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance since boyhood.  Slogan on box says, &amp;#34;If your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t exist.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This may not be the original Old Spice smell, but it is close enough to recall the memory of my father. The smell is pleasant, manly, and not overpowering. I apply a couple of finger swabs to my neck and chest in the morning and throughout the day I sense a pleasant, nostalgic aroma.</li>
            <li> I just like it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it is the same size product you can get in the store.  Including shipping, I paid more this online than I would have at the local retail store.  Will not order this product online again.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was a spray, I read it as a &#x27;splash&amp;#34; and prefer the splash type, otherwise all was well.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS THE SAME SMELL FOR DECADES.LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I AM 73 YEARS YOUNG AND HAVE USED OLD SPICE PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;MY ORDER FOR SPLASH COLOGNE ARRIVED TODAY IN PERFECT CONDITION; BUT WITH ONE PROBLE. THE SHIPPER SENY SPRAY BOTTLES BY MISTAKE.I WILL USE THE PRODUCT AS SHIPPED BUT THE SHIPPER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS ERROR</li>
            <li> Good trusty brand but unfortunately this time the fragrance is on the lighter side and not as strong as the old Spice that I used to use. Overall, it is still ok for me.</li>
            <li> It is the traditional smell but the container is not. They used to sell these with a ceramicey container but now its thin plastic chromed over at the top. I don&#x27;t know why that matters to me, but it does.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Your don&#x27;t get overwhelmed with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t want the spray. The picture in your advertisement showed a non spray bottle. I received the spray bottle. The scent has been weakened probably due to a cost reduction. The qty in ounces has been reduced. All these reasons is why I will not use Old Spice again unless it is brought up to the way it was. I have used Old Spice for over 50 years and now I regret it will end.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering Fresh scent and was very disappointed when it arrived.  I do not like the smell of this and they won&#x27;t allow me to return it.  I would not recommend ordering any colonge online... If they don&#x27;t have what you want they will just send you one and you won&#x27;t be able to return it...</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would last so I didn&#x27;t want an aftershave. I paid more for this &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; because of it, yet it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. The first few days I could smell it on myself for 4-6 hours, then 2 hours at most, then 30 minutes tops. At first I thought I got used to the smell real fast, but if I can&#x27;t smell it no one can smell it on me, even inches away!&lt;br /&gt;This is upsetting because I really like the Old Spice smell, but I also don&#x27;t want to have to reapply it every 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he likes it. More than him, I really like it ;-) I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cologne that was something other than lavender blowing in the breeze on a summer day but couldnt make up my mind since there are so many colognes to chose from. I had remembered my granpappy always used this, had some amazon credit left over and figured why not! This stuff smells great and like others say it has that kind of man smell to it but isnt overpowering. Just what I needed so 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a usual cologne but turned out it&#x27;s a spray which was not in description. I bought it for my husband who is very conservative man and hate to change anything. Anyway he gave it a try and said it was OK, so I gave 4 stars .&lt;br /&gt;But the cologne itself is good.</li>
            <li> It was not really what I expected.  this Old spice was not like the cologne I used to use.  Still great smell but not the same.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product for quite a while. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store so I am pleased that you had it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect cant find in stores any more</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells like soap to me. I guess for 8 bucks there are worse things to smell like, but it&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing. Just take a shower instead.</li>
