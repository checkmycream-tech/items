            <li>Great packaging in leather snap case.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>

            <li>This pair is a good size and it does its job nicely!</li>
            <li>so I can not review product, the brand has a good reputation.</li>

            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Good quality tweezers.  </li>
            <li>These are good tweezers.</li>
            <li>Good price too for two of them.  </li>
            <li>I think they are made of stainless steel and have a perfect grip and great accuracy to pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Good quality, nice case.</li>
            <li>Perfect set of tweezers for first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>This set of tweezers is great (they are new,so it must be this way), just requiring getting used to use the fine point one.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman tweezers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>I had no idea tweezers could be this nice.</li>
            <li>but these petite pointed ones do a *spectacular* job at grasping, holding, and pulling the largest to the tiniest of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best tweezers out there.</li>
            <li>They are the best for ingrown hairs and normal tweezing.</li>
            <li>The Slant Tweezer is perfect for normal brow tweezing.</li>
            <li>and you would need a very fine file to maintain them over time.  </li>
            <li>The slant tip is wonderful for ordinary tweezing and the pointed tip does a great job at removing ingrown hairs or even slivers.  </li>
            <li>I needed a set of tweezers that I could easily take with me in my toiletry bag that would also be in their own case.</li>
            <li>Love the tweezers</li>
            <li>Which didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the tweezers though :)</li>
            <li>The carrying pouch is nice but seems cheap.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>This pair is even better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had the larger version for years and was never overly impressed</li>
            <li>They work so much better even when \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; that I can&#x27;t bear to be without them to send them away in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best personal grooming tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I haven&#x27;t used many...</li>
            <li>The tweezers don&#x27;t come in a leather pouch, it&#x27;s more like pleather.</li>
            <li>Since then I have purchased many of these sets from Amazon to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I love them both:</li>
            <li>but, more importantly, I absolutely LOVE these tweezers -</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this set, I used mid-quality Revlon tweezers, and they were OK.  </li>
            <li>They work great, are high quality and very reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li>great product love the ability to hold the two most important tweezers in a very convenient bag.</li>
            <li>These tiny tweezers and their nice protective case are easily packed, easy to clean in alcohol, and have excellent points.</li>
            <li>The flat shorter tweezer is perfect for removing those hairs and the fine point sharp tweezer is perfect for getting things that get under the skin like splinters and whatnot.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are really that good.  </li>
            <li>The leather case keeps them protected and is easy to throw in my purse or car when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>The leather case is sturdy with a convenient and strong magnetic catch.</li>
            <li>I was using a cheap pair from the drugstore for years, and when they fell apart I decided to try out some nicer ones.  </li>
            <li>Precise alignment.</li>
            <li>This petite size is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>Overall just darn great.</li>
            <li>Here in PA tick country they&#x27;re indispensable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say too many good things about these tweezers, and have already recommended them to many other hybridizers.</li>
            <li>Very effective when used properly.</li>
            <li>Nor did I ever think tweezers could ever get me so excited.  </li>
            <li>Overall these are nice tweezers!</li>
            <li>One of my most appreciated purchases to date.</li>
            <li>Good enough as per my wifeÂ´s words.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price: fair enough.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in a previous review tweezerman makes the absolute best tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect that much of a difference, but these Tweezerman tools are ridiculously nice.  </li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They are very good quality and not too small for my hands.</li>
            <li>The price is so good through Amazon that you can buy an extra pack to keep in your glove compartment for emergency sliver retrieval, or those times you&#x27;re early for carpool and have nothing better to do than inspect your shaggy eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The case is very high quality leather and keeps the tweezers protected and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice set, you will be pleased as long as you are certain</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is a great little kit.</li>
            <li>The pointed unit is SUPER sharp and good for extracting embedded slivers.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>worth every penny....</li>
            <li>Both units are nice stainless and come with a clear rubber tip to protect them and your kit bag if you do not use the travel case.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and they are actually sharp and last, not if I could just find a way not to love them in my drawer!</li>
            <li>I bought a set a bit over a year ago, and the finer tweezer was really good, although its quality decayed by time (which is expected).</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This set is perfect for my needs (brows and occasional other miscellaneous uses like removing splinters or ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li>I feel they are a little over priced for the simplicity of them, but it is a nice set of tweezers!</li>
            <li>But the stanless looks like nice quality so keep them clean and sharp</li>
            <li>They are good but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>With each hair or whatever you use these tweezers on make sure you clean off the tips (especially with the flat head) as it won&#x27;t make a great pinch on your next use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little pouch is lovely, well-made, and comes in many colors and patterns.  </li>
            <li>Nice size, super sharp.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set - the slant has a very flat surface that is pure ease to grab the smallest slivers, hairs, threads, bits of skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>one in my toiletry bag for travel, and i just purchased this set to add to our first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>I had tried several pairs of tweezers including $10 drugstore tweezers in the hopes of being able to pluck eyebrow and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>They are 22 times better than the cheapo ones you get a local chain.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are the same as we used to get back in the day, with perfectly-ground tips and a nice, smooth pinch.  </li>
            <li>The tips of the pointed one are not as fine as those of larger Tweezerman tweezers we own, but they are adequately sharp for all but the smallest targets.  </li>
            <li>I am using these for removing anthers, (the pollen parts), from certain plants for use in hybridization experiments.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands, but have no problem using these to tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>While I do not have large hands, I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and do not have dainty hands either, I find the slim design not as awkward as the mini but feels better for me than the regular.</li>
            <li>so I get a lot metal splinters and these tweezers are a real life saver.</li>
            <li>Both tweezers work really well, and I&#x27;ve had no problems getting hair out -</li>
            <li>Also the plastic coverings of the tips have a wired and intense smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe next time will buy a larger kind of tweezer for comfort in use.</li>
            <li>They really grip each hair so you end up with less pain from hairs slipping out of the tweezers resulting in more time spent (more time equals more pain).</li>
            <li>The long thin one is perfect for digging out those ingrown hairs that lie just under the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>I found one of these Tweezerman packs at a Marshall&#x27;s discount store about ten years ago, and given their cheap price I assumed they were a down line for the regular kind.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is decent with a magnetic snap and does the job of keeping your tools coralled.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe it that packaging is not &#x27;frustration free&#x27; and the package is marked made in India (as per amazon descriptions) but there was a sticker on the package that said made in Italy.  </li>
            <li>The tips are decently even.</li>
            <li>The tweezers themselves are high quality in every sense of the word.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for your \\&quot;pluckng needs\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for $10</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers .</li>
            <li>and I do better with a mirror for little hairs.</li>
            <li>The new set I bought has its finer tweezer of a low quality from the very first day.</li>
            <li>but they still work 90% as well as new.</li>
            <li>This set really is what I wanted as I don&#x27;t have any preference to brands when it comes to my tweezers though this set of tweezers are really helpful and are constructed to last.</li>
            <li>recommend these tweezers as they have lasted a long time are a compact enough to be easily stored within your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>They work great on unwanted facial hair, splinters, and insect stingers, and when I have been clumsy and dropped the pointy ones on their tips i sent them back</li>
            <li>The tips are sharp so that you can actually grip the hair and see the tip gripping the hair before you pull.  </li>
            <li>The Point Tweezer is REALLY sharp (almost pin-like) -- perfect for ingrown hairs, and prying out those random not-quite-long-enough-to-grip brow hairs.</li>
            <li>Love the small size and travel pouch.</li>
            <li>easy to use, gets every little hair....</li>
            <li>Keep the plastic guard on the tips because they are sharp, and it keeps them clean.</li>
            <li>but that is the less important thing about the product.</li>
            <li>I got pretty much what I expected.  </li>
            <li>They are a good compromise for a travel set in that they are less likely to be bent if dropped or crushed in luggage.  </li>
            <li>They are super sharp and well built.  </li>
            <li>and tweezerman fixed them for $5.00.  </li>
            <li>Both tweezers are well made and grip precisely and firmly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set because my wife kept hiding my old tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They are more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The leather case is a nice bonus, as are the little caps for protecting the sharp ends of the tweezers.</li>
            <li>The needle one in particular is useful for little hairs or splinters.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for daily use or whatever.</li>
            <li>I find the pointy tweezers less useful than those with the blunt end.</li>
            <li>Their quality is like no other tweezers.</li>
            <li>Some time ago I had a my brows shaped professionally at the Red Door Salon  in NYC.</li>
            <li>Apparently that was a mistake because airport security took the pointed tweezer from my set away from me and threw it in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t drop the tweezers thought, because the long thin one I can see bending.  </li>

            <li> Precise alignment.</li>
            <li> This petite size is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> Overall just darn great.</li>
            <li> Here in PA tick country they&#x27;re indispensable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say too many good things about these tweezers, and have already recommended them to many other hybridizers.</li>
            <li> Very effective when used properly.</li>
            <li> Nor did I ever think tweezers could ever get me so excited.  </li>
            <li> Overall these are nice tweezers!</li>
            <li> One of my most appreciated purchases to date.</li>
            <li> Good enough as per my wifeÂ´s words.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price: fair enough.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in a previous review tweezerman makes the absolute best tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect that much of a difference, but these Tweezerman tools are ridiculously nice.  </li>
            <li> pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are very good quality and not too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> The price is so good through Amazon that you can buy an extra pack to keep in your glove compartment for emergency sliver retrieval, or those times you&#x27;re early for carpool and have nothing better to do than inspect your shaggy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The case is very high quality leather and keeps the tweezers protected and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice set, you will be pleased as long as you are certain</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit.</li>
            <li> The pointed unit is SUPER sharp and good for extracting embedded slivers.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> worth every penny....</li>
            <li> Both units are nice stainless and come with a clear rubber tip to protect them and your kit bag if you do not use the travel case.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and they are actually sharp and last, not if I could just find a way not to love them in my drawer!</li>
            <li> I bought a set a bit over a year ago, and the finer tweezer was really good, although its quality decayed by time (which is expected).</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for my needs (brows and occasional other miscellaneous uses like removing splinters or ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li> I feel they are a little over priced for the simplicity of them, but it is a nice set of tweezers!</li>
            <li> But the stanless looks like nice quality so keep them clean and sharp</li>
            <li> They are good but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> With each hair or whatever you use these tweezers on make sure you clean off the tips (especially with the flat head) as it won&#x27;t make a great pinch on your next use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little pouch is lovely, well-made, and comes in many colors and patterns.  </li>
            <li> Nice size, super sharp.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set - the slant has a very flat surface that is pure ease to grab the smallest slivers, hairs, threads, bits of skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> one in my toiletry bag for travel, and i just purchased this set to add to our first aid kit.  </li>
            <li> I had tried several pairs of tweezers including $10 drugstore tweezers in the hopes of being able to pluck eyebrow and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> They are 22 times better than the cheapo ones you get a local chain.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are the same as we used to get back in the day, with perfectly-ground tips and a nice, smooth pinch.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the pointed one are not as fine as those of larger Tweezerman tweezers we own, but they are adequately sharp for all but the smallest targets.  </li>
            <li> I am using these for removing anthers, (the pollen parts), from certain plants for use in hybridization experiments.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands, but have no problem using these to tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> While I do not have large hands, I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and do not have dainty hands either, I find the slim design not as awkward as the mini but feels better for me than the regular.</li>
            <li> so I get a lot metal splinters and these tweezers are a real life saver.</li>
            <li> Both tweezers work really well, and I&#x27;ve had no problems getting hair out -</li>
            <li> Also the plastic coverings of the tips have a wired and intense smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe next time will buy a larger kind of tweezer for comfort in use.</li>
            <li> They really grip each hair so you end up with less pain from hairs slipping out of the tweezers resulting in more time spent (more time equals more pain).</li>
            <li> The long thin one is perfect for digging out those ingrown hairs that lie just under the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> I found one of these Tweezerman packs at a Marshall&#x27;s discount store about ten years ago, and given their cheap price I assumed they were a down line for the regular kind.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is decent with a magnetic snap and does the job of keeping your tools coralled.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe it that packaging is not &#x27;frustration free&#x27; and the package is marked made in India (as per amazon descriptions) but there was a sticker on the package that said made in Italy.  </li>
            <li> The tips are decently even.</li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves are high quality in every sense of the word.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for your \\&quot;pluckng needs\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> highly recommended for $10</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers .</li>
            <li> and I do better with a mirror for little hairs.</li>
            <li> The new set I bought has its finer tweezer of a low quality from the very first day.</li>
            <li> but they still work 90% as well as new.</li>
            <li> This set really is what I wanted as I don&#x27;t have any preference to brands when it comes to my tweezers though this set of tweezers are really helpful and are constructed to last.</li>
            <li> recommend these tweezers as they have lasted a long time are a compact enough to be easily stored within your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> They work great on unwanted facial hair, splinters, and insect stingers, and when I have been clumsy and dropped the pointy ones on their tips i sent them back</li>
            <li> The tips are sharp so that you can actually grip the hair and see the tip gripping the hair before you pull.  </li>
            <li> The Point Tweezer is REALLY sharp (almost pin-like) -- perfect for ingrown hairs, and prying out those random not-quite-long-enough-to-grip brow hairs.</li>
            <li> Love the small size and travel pouch.</li>
            <li> easy to use, gets every little hair....</li>
            <li> Keep the plastic guard on the tips because they are sharp, and it keeps them clean.</li>
            <li> but that is the less important thing about the product.</li>
            <li> I got pretty much what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They are a good compromise for a travel set in that they are less likely to be bent if dropped or crushed in luggage.  </li>
            <li> They are super sharp and well built.  </li>
            <li> and tweezerman fixed them for $5.00.  </li>
            <li> Both tweezers are well made and grip precisely and firmly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set because my wife kept hiding my old tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They are more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The leather case is a nice bonus, as are the little caps for protecting the sharp ends of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> The needle one in particular is useful for little hairs or splinters.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for daily use or whatever.</li>
            <li> I find the pointy tweezers less useful than those with the blunt end.</li>
            <li> Their quality is like no other tweezers.</li>
            <li> Some time ago I had a my brows shaped professionally at the Red Door Salon  in NYC.</li>
            <li> Apparently that was a mistake because airport security took the pointed tweezer from my set away from me and threw it in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t drop the tweezers thought, because the long thin one I can see bending.  </li>
            <li> One is pin point, the other is broad edge.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone, and especially over any other comparable set out there.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> slipping fingers is not the problem.</li>
            <li> Santa brought these for the kids&#x27; stockings this year, and now even my son who goes to military school is a convert.  </li>
            <li> Always trusted Tweezerman products to do the job as well as could be expected.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviews have said...</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> I would not trust my eyebrows to any other brand of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> other requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one set for traveling and 1 for home, and purchased other sets for gifts.  </li>
            <li> The reason I am giving 4 stars is because I ordered a black case and it was pink.</li>
            <li> The set of two includes one with a blunt end and one with a very sharp, pointy end.</li>
            <li> leather case was black and not brown as it shows the description</li>
            <li> but I did order a black leather case</li>
            <li> Havent used them extensively and went back and forth between these and the Rubis, but Rubis just too dang expensive.</li>
            <li> simple, but seriously well-made and high-quality.</li>
            <li> even little ingrown hairs are a cinch with the specialized tweezers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I had any Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> Not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped these a couple of times and bent the tip on one end slightly; they will fix that for a small fee</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like the way the company produces this product has changed and the quality of the past is not available anymore.</li>
            <li> those are small nits and for about $23</li>
            <li> the petite size (small) is what you are after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers are a bit small, but not so small that they are hard to use.</li>
            <li> These tweezers will grab the finest of hairs and hardly ever slip.</li>
            <li> I mean $35 a pair???  </li>
            <li> Almost every time, those tweezers would fail to grip the hair and just slip.</li>
            <li> I find the case useless but if you would use a case for your tweezers</li>
            <li> I hate false advertising.</li>
            <li> with these bad boys on hand.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best tweezers on the market. These tiny tweezers and their nice protective case are easily packed, easy to clean in alcohol, and have excellent points. They are the best for ingrown hairs and normal tweezing.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for a great price. I think they are made of stainless steel and have a perfect grip and great accuracy to pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case was black and not brown as it shows the description but that is the less important thing about the product. Each one comes with a rubber cap to protect the tip of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of these tweezers i have purchased.  I keep one in my makeup kit at home, one in my toiletry bag for travel, and i just purchased this set to add to our first aid kit.  They work great on unwanted facial hair, splinters, and insect stingers, and when I have been clumsy and dropped the pointy ones on their tips i sent them back and tweezerman fixed them for $5.00.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  It is a stocking stuffer for my daughter so I can not review product, the brand has a good reputation.</li>
            <li> I already own a set and they are awesome. The reason I am giving 4 stars is because I ordered a black case and it was pink. Not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have said...these are great. I had never used pointed tweezers before but I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would write a review for tweezers, but here I am!  Nor did I ever think tweezers could ever get me so excited.  I am using these for removing anthers, (the pollen parts), from certain plants for use in hybridization experiments.  I was using a cheap pair from the drugstore for years, and when they fell apart I decided to try out some nicer ones.  I really didn&#x27;t expect that much of a difference, but these Tweezerman tools are ridiculously nice.  I am amazed at the precision of the tips, and I never drop my pollen anymore!  I can&#x27;t say too many good things about these tweezers, and have already recommended them to many other hybridizers.</li>
            <li> This set of tweezers is great (they are new,so it must be this way), just requiring getting used to use the fine point one. Good quality case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe next time will buy a larger kind of tweezer for comfort in use.</li>
            <li> Perfect set of tweezers for first aid kit. The needle nose tweezer is great for pulling ticks. Precise alignment. Nice case. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Both tweezers are well made and grip precisely and firmly.  The tips of the pointed one are not as fine as those of larger Tweezerman tweezers we own, but they are adequately sharp for all but the smallest targets.  They are a good compromise for a travel set in that they are less likely to be bent if dropped or crushed in luggage.  The leather case is sturdy with a convenient and strong magnetic catch.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers but I did order a black leather case and I was sent a purple one. Which didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the tweezers though :)</li>
            <li> I work in a machine shop so I get a lot metal splinters and these tweezers are a real life saver.</li>
            <li> Nice size, super sharp. Great for those pesky ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I had tried several pairs of tweezers including $10 drugstore tweezers in the hopes of being able to pluck eyebrow and nose hairs. Almost every time, those tweezers would fail to grip the hair and just slip. These tweezers will grab the finest of hairs and hardly ever slip. Definitely worth the cost. The pointy tweezer for ingrown hairs I view as a bonus but I will say that it is also very effective.  Don&#x27;t let the marketing of tweezers with \\&quot;grips\\&quot; fool you... slipping fingers is not the problem.</li>
            <li> i use these tweezers every week, both work great!... easy to use, gets every little hair.... worth every penny.... would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves are high quality in every sense of the word. The carrying pouch is nice but seems cheap. One of my most appreciated purchases to date.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever - they are perfect for ingrown hairs.  The metal is solid, sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t rust.  The convenient carrying pouch is perfect so that you don&#x27;t lose the pair, and also perfect for travel.  Make sure you don&#x27;t drop the tweezers thought, because the long thin one I can see bending.  I&#x27;ve had these for years now and I love them.  The tips are sharp so that you can actually grip the hair and see the tip gripping the hair before you pull.  The long thin one is perfect for digging out those ingrown hairs that lie just under the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a splinter would have a chance of staying in your hand, arm, etc. with these bad boys on hand. They are quite sharp. I would not trust my eyebrows to any other brand of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to crappy tweezers.  Tweezerman tweezers are amazing.  If they can grab it, they can pull it.  They are super sharp and well built.  I had no idea tweezers could be this nice.</li>
            <li> This petite size is so comfortable. While I do not have large hands, I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and do not have dainty hands either, I find the slim design not as awkward as the mini but feels better for me than the regular. I only wish that they sold these separately as I do not use the pointed tweezers often and would like another of the slant. I find the case useless but if you would use a case for your tweezers it is well made and the magnetic closure is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit. Both tweezers work really well, and I&#x27;ve had no problems getting hair out - even little ingrown hairs are a cinch with the specialized tweezers. The leather case keeps them protected and is easy to throw in my purse or car when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li> Love this! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set - the slant has a very flat surface that is pure ease to grab the smallest slivers, hairs, threads, bits of skin, etc.  The pointed unit is SUPER sharp and good for extracting embedded slivers.  Both units are nice stainless and come with a clear rubber tip to protect them and your kit bag if you do not use the travel case.  The travel case is decent with a magnetic snap and does the job of keeping your tools coralled.  Great for your BoB, EDC, tool or fist aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are petite tools so durability is a question and you would need a very fine file to maintain them over time.  But the stanless looks like nice quality so keep them clean and sharp and I doubt they will rust.  My only gripe it that packaging is not &#x27;frustration free&#x27; and the package is marked made in India (as per amazon descriptions) but there was a sticker on the package that said made in Italy.  Maybe the case was made in Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway those are small nits and for about $23 this is a nice set, you will be pleased as long as you are certain the petite size (small) is what you are after.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because my wife kept hiding my old tweezers.  This pair is even better.  Good quality, nice case.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great price!  Just as expected!</li>
            <li> great product love the ability to hold the two most important tweezers in a very convenient bag.</li>
            <li> Some time ago I had a my brows shaped professionally at the Red Door Salon  in NYC. These were the tweezers used by their aesthetician, specifically the pointed ones. I&#x27;d had the larger version for years and was never overly impressed but these petite pointed ones do a *spectacular* job at grasping, holding, and pulling the largest to the tiniest of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has thicker brows and prefers the slant tip version so this made the kit an especially good bargain with each of us getting our perfect Tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman guarantees the result or your money back so you have nothing to loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped these a couple of times and bent the tip on one end slightly; they will fix that for a small fee but they still work 90% as well as new. They work so much better even when \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; that I can&#x27;t bear to be without them to send them away in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for my needs (brows and occasional other miscellaneous uses like removing splinters or ingrown hairs). The Point Tweezer is REALLY sharp (almost pin-like) -- perfect for ingrown hairs, and prying out those random not-quite-long-enough-to-grip brow hairs. The Slant Tweezer is perfect for normal brow tweezing. They really grip each hair so you end up with less pain from hairs slipping out of the tweezers resulting in more time spent (more time equals more pain). Completely happy!</li>
            <li> Best personal grooming tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. Mind you, I haven&#x27;t used many... bought these so I could quit stealing them from my wife.</li>
            <li> Overall these are nice tweezers! I feel they are a little over priced for the simplicity of them, but it is a nice set of tweezers!</li>
            <li> The best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;If you use tweezers, buy this one and stop wasting your money on the others.</li>
            <li> They are 22 times better than the cheapo ones you get a local chain.  The quality is good and they are actually sharp and last, not if I could just find a way not to love them in my drawer!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! This pair is a good size and it does its job nicely!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in a previous review tweezerman makes the absolute best tweezers.  They are more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are good but not worth the price. I hate false advertising. The tweezers don&#x27;t come in a leather pouch, it&#x27;s more like pleather.</li>
            <li> Good enough as per my wifeÂ´s words. Precises&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice pack for using in travels or other requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: fair enough.</li>
            <li> I found one of these Tweezerman packs at a Marshall&#x27;s discount store about ten years ago, and given their cheap price I assumed they were a down line for the regular kind.  But no!  They were awesome!  Since then I have purchased many of these sets from Amazon to give as gifts.  Santa brought these for the kids&#x27; stockings this year, and now even my son who goes to military school is a convert.  The little pouch is lovely, well-made, and comes in many colors and patterns.  The tweezers are the same as we used to get back in the day, with perfectly-ground tips and a nice, smooth pinch.  The price is so good through Amazon that you can buy an extra pack to keep in your glove compartment for emergency sliver retrieval, or those times you&#x27;re early for carpool and have nothing better to do than inspect your shaggy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Cheaper price reflects quality. The tips are decently even.</li>
            <li> They come in a wonderful case.  I love them both: easy to use and I do better with a mirror for little hairs. Very effective when used properly. Keep the plastic guard on the tips because they are sharp, and it keeps them clean. Great buy. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Upon returning home from a recent trip to Mexico, I had packed my tweezer set in my carry on luggage.  Apparently that was a mistake because airport security took the pointed tweezer from my set away from me and threw it in the garbage.  I literally cried.  As soon as I arrived home, I ordered a replacement set even though I really only needed the pointed tweezer.  Why?  After shopping around I realized this set was the best value but, more importantly, I absolutely LOVE these tweezers - the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  They are well made, perfectly aligned, and do a wonderful job.  The slant tip is wonderful for ordinary tweezing and the pointed tip does a great job at removing ingrown hairs or even slivers.  The case is very high quality leather and keeps the tweezers protected and easy to find.  I&#x27;m spoiled now.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I got pretty much what I expected.  They are very good quality and not too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> Good quality tweezers.  One is pin point, the other is broad edge.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product! Highly recommended for daily use or whatever. Nice packaging and wonderful quality of product. Overall just darn great.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers. The set of two includes one with a blunt end and one with a very sharp, pointy end. They are definitely a step up from those you&#x27;d by at a grocery or drug store. I find the pointy tweezers less useful than those with the blunt end. But, I&#x27;ve read that others feel just the opposite. I guess it depends on personal preference. I like knowing I have both on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are a bit small, but not so small that they are hard to use. I have large hands, but have no problem using these to tweeze my eyebrows. The leather case is a nice bonus, as are the little caps for protecting the sharp ends of the tweezers. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I bought a set a bit over a year ago, and the finer tweezer was really good, although its quality decayed by time (which is expected). The new set I bought has its finer tweezer of a low quality from the very first day. Also the plastic coverings of the tips have a wired and intense smell.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the way the company produces this product has changed and the quality of the past is not available anymore.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned. I bought one set for traveling and 1 for home, and purchased other sets for gifts.  I use them for my eyebrows and they are excellent.</li>
            <li> Always a fan of Tweezerman.  Great packaging in leather snap case.</li>
            <li> Quality product made of surgical steel.  Always trusted Tweezerman products to do the job as well as could be expected.  Highly recommend this for your \\&quot;pluckng needs\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I needed a set of tweezers that I could easily take with me in my toiletry bag that would also be in their own case. This set really is what I wanted as I don&#x27;t have any preference to brands when it comes to my tweezers though this set of tweezers are really helpful and are constructed to last. The flat shorter tweezer is perfect for removing those hairs and the fine point sharp tweezer is perfect for getting things that get under the skin like splinters and whatnot. They came with plastic cover tips for each tweezer though over time they start to fade yellow and look gross. Without those plastic tips they will tend to poke the case as well. With each hair or whatever you use these tweezers on make sure you clean off the tips (especially with the flat head) as it won&#x27;t make a great pinch on your next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these tweezers as they have lasted a long time are a compact enough to be easily stored within your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> Havent used them extensively and went back and forth between these and the Rubis, but Rubis just too dang expensive. I mean $35 a pair???  Rubis must be gold plated.  This set came as a pair and they are well made and they do grab the smallest of smallest hairs...i know I tried immediately.  Good price too for two of them.  Cant speak for longevity.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really that good.  Before purchasing this set, I used mid-quality Revlon tweezers, and they were OK.  These work really well.  Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> received it 2 days earlier than indicated. labeled as &amp;#34;made in Italy.&amp;#34; excellent quality. highly recommended for $10</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful tweezerman tweezers customer for about 10 years. Their quality is like no other tweezers. They work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I had any Tweezerman products. I&#x27;m happy to say that they still make the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. Here in PA tick country they&#x27;re indispensable. Not to mention the TuneUp service.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best tweezers out there. The needle one in particular is useful for little hairs or splinters.</li>
            <li> Love the small size and travel pouch.</li>
            <li> yea, tweezers, but these are probably one of the best-made anything i&#x27;ve purchased, for the price they were at. simple, but seriously well-made and high-quality. def. would recommend to anyone, and especially over any other comparable set out there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers . They work great, are high quality and very reasonably priced!!! Would defnitely buy again!</li>
