            <li>It&#x27;s ok was delivered on time</li>
            <li>but over all it&#x27;s a ok product</li>
            <li>The product is cheap and unsatisfactory!</li>
            <li>Good price, delivered on time, and my daughter is happy with the overall quality and appearance.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it,</li>
            <li>but besides that it was great fit very well</li>
            <li>up some of my hair in the picture so lengths and widths are more easily seen.</li>
            <li>SOOOO cool!</li>
            <li>Tangled easily.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely perfect, the picture on the left is exactly what you are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone that has longer hair and that wants a good quality full head extension cheaply priced (:</li>
            <li>Very high quality and looks amazing</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really kinky curly at all nice and body waved like the model wearing it in the pic</li>
            <li>would only recomend for a Halloween look don&#x27;t expect this to be like great hair at all</li>
            <li>cheap hair.</li>
            <li>color blend is not at all visible (i have layered hair and clipped in the extensions near my crown) and the top color gets lost in my hair, it kind of just looks like my hair is highlighted.</li>
            <li>Cute but very very, order two if you want a full head.</li>
            <li>I saw all the great reviews and got really excited, but it did not live up to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The crimpy look is odd, but once I straightened them, they looked good!</li>
            <li>the only thing is they are alttle to shiny, but slap some powder on em and they are good to go, overall very pleased</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, and the lenght goes down to my belly button!</li>
            <li>Really long, I cut mine to make it shorter, the clips don&#x27;t always stay in my hair, the colors good.</li>
            <li>the colors are amazing and its so pretty plus it came early.</li>
            <li>Love them, they really look so real, everybody thinks i did this to my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good and long , it made my hair thicker</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>When it came i was super exited and they were exactly as they show in the picture .</li>
            <li>Very neat for a fun look!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous with black hair, I imagine.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It was exactly how they pictured it.</li>
            <li>Within the first week there was tons of shedding, matted-ness, and friziness.</li>
            <li>Extremely long and very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind my hair is straight in the picture, and of course straight and crimped won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>still too long but love them</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>when on you can tell it isn&#x27;t real hair</li>
            <li>super soft and decent quality though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would look pretty on someone with a little shorter, darker hair.</li>
            <li>Silky soft, thick and feels like real, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>If you put your fingers through them you will end up with a decent amount of the hair in your hand.</li>
            <li>just incase one brakes of they are super long</li>
            <li>However, rather than being waves or loose curls as shown in the photograph with the model, it is more crimped and will only match my hair if I braid it the night before.</li>
            <li>they work well with blonde hair wish it came in sepperated clips but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li>It turns out that they review your review of the hair first and will only post a review if it is 5 stars</li>
            <li>Maybe if I take them to a professional hair styles, she can match it up to my hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soo soft as well &amp;#</li>
            <li>I got it and had it installed by a professional</li>
            <li>tangled to fast and dry</li>
            <li>My closure was frizzy and ugly and the other hair (not from uniwigs) was flawless.</li>
            <li>so i straighted them and they are beautiful and thick omg very thick and comes with another clip in the bag</li>
            <li>The curls are more like crimps from when I braid my hair wet and let it down dry..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to wear the first few times</li>
            <li>They tangle REALLY REALLY easy and there hard to brush and wash!</li>

            <li> And due to amazon requiring more words on this review I am writing random words</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the hair was not real and the shipping took forever</li>
            <li> For people with shorter hair these extensions are going to be awkwardly long</li>
            <li> Just really long too long for my hair had to cut them and</li>
            <li> I have very long hair dyed purple and this stays in and does not irritate scalp, does not easly tangle, sheds very little and looks NATURAL!!</li>
            <li> I mean really and for</li>
            <li> you expect more than complete frizzy crap</li>
            <li> (: when they got here i didn&#x27;t like the loose curls</li>
            <li> They look fake and super dry.</li>
            <li> I left a review on their site about my experience after having it for less than a week and what is happening.</li>
            <li> The colors are a lot darker than the picture, it&#x27;s very shiny and extremely thick!</li>
            <li> Not what u expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about the product was how kinky looking the extensions were, so I looked up a way to curl the synthetic extensions you just need to spray strands of hair with cold/room temp water and set curl iron on lowest heat setting while hair is still slightly wet curl and hold for about 65 seconds and it came out</li>
            <li> Not too thick and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the amount there being sold for.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH it</li>
            <li> Very shaggy, I ended up cutting it and making it a play wig for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I put coconut oil in mine and let it sit for a few days because they were so tangled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy for my daughter to use in her hair for dress up.</li>
            <li> totally wasted.</li>
            <li> Waste of money lies!</li>
            <li> I mean nothing it looks like</li>
            <li> it looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> just saying you know your wrong</li>
            <li> it looks very fake</li>
            <li> Ended up in the trash. :-(</li>
            <li> 😒 womp womp I am suuuuuper disappointed regardless of amount of money you spend</li>
            <li> The worst part is how bad they shed.</li>
            <li> So horrible!!!</li>
            <li> So yea like I said they are horrible</li>

            <li> Very shaggy, I ended up cutting it and making it a play wig for my daughter.</li>

            <li> Cute but very very, order two if you want a full head.</li>
            <li> but they are heavey beautiful tho looks even better straight</li>
            <li> This is just A beautiful and fun way to make your hair look so good and colorful.</li>
            <li> Not what u expected. Tangled easily. Really long, I cut mine to make it shorter, the clips don&#x27;t always stay in my hair, the colors good. I put coconut oil in mine and let it sit for a few days because they were so tangled. Maybe if I take them to a professional hair styles, she can match it up to my hair. Not to happy with them. Not worth the amount there being sold for.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing the advertised pictures! Extremely long and very cheap looking. It looks like plastic barbie hair. I tried to trim it up and make it usable but up against my hair it looks ridiculous. It&#x27;s too heavy for my daughter to use in her hair for dress up. Ended up in the trash. :-(</li>
            <li> So horrible!!! Waste of money lies! Lies! Lies! So yea like I said they are horrible they look nothing like the picture I mean nothing it looks like someone else had them tried to starighten them and returned them 😒 womp womp I am suuuuuper disappointed regardless of amount of money you spend you expect more than complete frizzy crap I mean really and for those of you giving 5 stars you are liars just saying you know your wrong😒</li>
            <li> Silky soft, thick and feels like real, healthy hair. However, rather than being waves or loose curls as shown in the photograph with the model, it is more crimped and will only match my hair if I braid it the night before. Also, my hair is long enough (~40 cm extensions are my normal hair length) that the pink is entirely hidden and only purple shows. Not a huge problem except that my hair is naturally platinum blonde--I&#x27;m sure this would look pretty on someone with a little shorter, darker hair. Gorgeous with black hair, I imagine. Otherwise, I have no complaints about quality!&lt;br /&gt;(Tied up some of my hair in the picture so lengths and widths are more easily seen. Keep in mind my hair is straight in the picture, and of course straight and crimped won&#x27;t work! ;) Yours may!)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Later I decided to try to straighten the hair. It took heat as well as if not better than real hair!</li>
            <li> I really love the how perfect the color of the extensions were! They came in good condition! The only thing I disliked about the product was how kinky looking the extensions were, so I looked up a way to curl the synthetic extensions you just need to spray strands of hair with cold/room temp water and set curl iron on lowest heat setting while hair is still slightly wet curl and hold for about 65 seconds and it came out perfect.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/4/14&lt;br /&gt;I need to correct myself for curling it I held it for 35 secs to avoid damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry y&#x27;all</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good and long , it made my hair thicker but it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to wear the first few times but it&#x27;s maybe mostly cause I wear this in a braid , I gave it a four because it&#x27;s real nice hair ( put some powder on it ) but it didn&#x27;t blend well with my hair hence the braiding.</li>
            <li> i love the colors of this product .. but it does not feel good on my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok was delivered on time but it&#x27;s really kinky curly at all nice and body waved like the model wearing it in the pic and it&#x27;s thin you will need to order 3 to do a full head unless u just want a colored mullet lol colors are ok but not the best it&#x27;s kinda cheap made but over all it&#x27;s a ok product would only recomend for a Halloween look don&#x27;t expect this to be like great hair at all</li>
            <li> The product is cheap and unsatisfactory!</li>
            <li> This purchase was for my teenage daughter. Of course they are into colored hair and fashion statements. Good price, delivered on time, and my daughter is happy with the overall quality and appearance. And due to amazon requiring more words on this review I am writing random words so I can finish this, Have a great day!</li>
            <li> Very high quality and looks amazing</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews and got really excited, but it did not live up to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;The color blend is not at all visible (i have layered hair and clipped in the extensions near my crown) and the top color gets lost in my hair, it kind of just looks like my hair is highlighted. For people with shorter hair these extensions are going to be awkwardly long (My hair falls mid back and they looked out of place). The worst part is how bad they shed. If you put your fingers through them you will end up with a decent amount of the hair in your hand. All in all I just wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li> SOOOO cool! I have very long hair dyed purple and this stays in and does not irritate scalp, does not easly tangle, sheds very little and looks NATURAL!!</li>
            <li> when on you can tell it isn&#x27;t real hair it looks very fake</li>
            <li> I just received my clip in and I LOVE it, def a good buy for sure! Ordered it Saturday came in of Tuesday. Will be placing another order soon.</li>
            <li> cheap hair. not how it appears. id like to be sent a BROWN to match my hair bc i cannot wear these and already cut them to try to make them work.</li>
            <li> I love these extensions! Great length and blends with my purple hair. The crimpy look is odd, but once I straightened them, they looked good!</li>
            <li> The curls are more like crimps from when I braid my hair wet and let it down dry.. as opposed to curled. I may end up curling it on a low setting so it looks like the picture. super soft and decent quality though</li>
            <li> Very neat for a fun look!</li>
            <li> I love them! Just really long too long for my hair had to cut them and still too long but love them</li>
            <li> I just got this today it was supppsed to come for another week I&#x27;m so happy(: when they got here i didn&#x27;t like the loose curls so i straighted them and they are beautiful and thick omg very thick and comes with another clip in the bag just incase one brakes of they are super long i just love them !&lt;3</li>
            <li> I lovee this ! When it came i was super exited and they were exactly as they show in the picture .</li>
            <li> tangled to fast and dry</li>
            <li> The colors are a lot darker than the picture, it&#x27;s very shiny and extremely thick!</li>
            <li> They tangle REALLY REALLY easy and there hard to brush and wash! They look fake and super dry. NOT WORTH it</li>
            <li> Came a week earlier xD THAT IS A BIG PLUS. The color is beautiful, and the lenght goes down to my belly button! Worth every cent. Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I ordered a lace closure in Feb of 2015.When I got it and had it installed by a professional it looked amazing and the stylist even thought it was good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair I installed for the rest of my hair is amazing quality (not from uniwigs) and it blended well. Within the first week there was tons of shedding, matted-ness, and friziness. My closure was frizzy and ugly and the other hair (not from uniwigs) was flawless. The shedding is to the point where the hair is left everywhere I go I can run one finger through and a clump comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;75$ totally wasted. I left a review on their site about my experience after having it for less than a week and what is happening. I look on the site to see if my review posted so that I can inform others and it did not. It turns out that they review your review of the hair first and will only post a review if it is 5 stars (so don&#x27;t believe the reviews you see on the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They emailed me and was told I would get credit but I haven&#x27;t seen it on my account and it probably wont compare to the 75$ I paid + would I want to put my money into this company again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;probably not.Also, the hair doesn&#x27;t come from Cali it comes from China.</li>
            <li> Its not even the color in the picture its faded</li>
            <li> literally perfect, would buy again</li>
            <li> When I got this product the fake hair was pretty much falling out!</li>
