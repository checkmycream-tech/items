            <li>good eyeliner</li>
            <li>I had tried an eyeliner pencil of a girlfriend&#x27;s and LOVED the way it looked.</li>
            <li>Quality is great, sharpen nicely without creating a lot of dust that gets in your eyes like some pencils.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find that perfect pencil, and I doubt I will find the one that works best in the water line, but this comes close enough.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>

            <li>This is my FAVORITE EYELINER EVER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared this eyeliner with Sephora and I must say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The makeup is more than good</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a good quality sharpener</li>
            <li>This is a nice eyeliner I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>Great smooth line and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>There was zero vibrancy, and the color turned out to be a very light silver-ish color.</li>
            <li>This pencil glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t budge until I wash my face at night!</li>
            <li>Love NYX, though.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye pencil glides on my eyes too.</li>
            <li>This is a great liner, highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put, doesn&#x27;t smudge, stays on well, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Love love it glides on smooth</li>
            <li>I really, really don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the easy glide and softness of this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Came to me quick!</li>
            <li>Stays put, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and STAYS where you put it.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a q-tip with this pencil every time to clean up smudges.</li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s smooth and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Like it but not my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>and they came quickly</li>
            <li>Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this pencil because I&#x27;ve never been able to use pencils since my eyelid skin is very thin</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The price was right knowing that I would not need it after the show.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the afore mentioned for half the problem.</li>
            <li>I only use it for the lower lash line, I use a liquid liner for my top lid.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the money and buy something else or go higher end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth liner, the color is a real black, but in my case it tend to smudge a little bit, but still a great option.</li>
            <li>It was a deep purple, very vibrant, glided easily over my lids - I wanted it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothlyâ€¦ very creamy formula for a pencil.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pigmented eye pencil, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This really does slide on (still have to be gentle though).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite black eyeliner, I can&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li>Well, I live in chicago and it&#x27;s snowing outside right now.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, it&#x27;s pretty waterproof and I&#x27;m finding that my regular eye makeup remover (Body Shop Chamomile) isn&#x27;t really strong enough, so</li>
            <li>I try something new .</li>
            <li>This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;m willing to buy.</li>
            <li>Creamy, smooth and dark.</li>
            <li>This is my first and last time I buy eye liner on Amazon.</li>
            <li>For my typical work day routine I will put the Jet Black Slide on Pencil on just my lower lash line to mid eye and then smudge it out with my ELF smudge brush and the affect is beautiful and so simple.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too soft...</li>
            <li>Jet Black is right.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I do not have sensitive eyes, nor do I wear contact lenses, but this eye liner made my eyes blood shot RED.</li>
            <li>So far I have purchased from MAC, Benefit, as well as urban decay stay on pencils and for the price</li>
            <li>Usually I can at least find something good to say about anything, but I immediately threw this product away and would not recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li>It was immediately recognizable that this pencil was not what I used previously, and when I texted my friend back, she pointed out the error of my way.</li>
            <li>The color of the Slide on Pencil is pure black with no sparkle.</li>
            <li>I had to continually run it over my eyes and press super hard for anything to even show it up.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had to continually run it over my eyes and press super hard for anything to even show it up.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time with very deep color.</li>
            <li> That said, especially at this price, this pencil is a keeper and I&#x27;ll be keeping my eyes open for other shades in the future.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I often wear the pencil on my lower lash line alone sans any eye shadow with a couple of coats of black mascara some foundation and a little bronzer and that would be the whole look.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is you must keep the top on or it will get hard and will be useless (lesson learned with the white and brown to this.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really disturbed that the product information talks about its lasting power- pretty impossible when it refuses to show up at all!</li>
            <li> I also realized that with the other brand pencils, if you don&#x27;t keep the top on them they get hard and is useless.</li>
            <li> The product barely comes off the pencil and have to press really hard.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time re-ordering and talking to customer service.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This could also be helped by setting it with a black matte shadow.</li>
            <li> I had previously - and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY black.  </li>
            <li> The cap was so tight, I couldn&#x27;t get it off.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel too guilty when I add new NYX items to my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> This pencil can be a little runny</li>
            <li> And the black is very black.  </li>
            <li> I usually get brown black and this time I got black.  </li>
            <li> was broke when I received it - sharpened it and have used it - but not very black - not exciting at all - sorry</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> I hope that helps the buyers have some clarity as to how poorly this eyeliner is made.</li>
            <li> The reason I have taken off one star because the formula is really thin.</li>
            <li> It is sad that it&#x27;s not mentioned from any of the brands.</li>
            <li> It was casually tossed into the box with no care.</li>
            <li> and I hate that &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; feeling.</li>

            <li> my wife loves this eyeliner. we ordered two and they came quickly but only 1 had a cap.</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner does smudge throughout the day which needs touch ups</li>
            <li> I wore it for 2 hours and it smeared. I never had this experience of smearing except for summer time. Well, I live in chicago and it&#x27;s snowing outside right now. I hope that helps the buyers have some clarity as to how poorly this eyeliner is made. Additionally, I do not have sensitive eyes, nor do I wear contact lenses, but this eye liner made my eyes blood shot RED.</li>
            <li> Great pencil! Great staying power!</li>
            <li> The only pencil eyeliner I use.  Stays put, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> was broke when I received it - sharpened it and have used it - but not very black - not exciting at all - sorry</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is a complete waste of money. It&#x27;s way too soft...it breaks off while you&#x27;re using it. I had to sharpen it 3 times just to outline both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this pencil in perfect condition, as well as in my prefurred time range. Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted: cheaper version of Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Bought this for back stage makeup for a theater production. The price was right knowing that I would not need it after the show.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day without any smearing! love it! I would recommend this to everyone that has a problem keeping eyeliner where it belongs, on your eyes rather than under them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased pencils of all different prices. So far I have purchased from MAC, Benefit, as well as urban decay stay on pencils and for the price it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s just as good as the afore mentioned for half the problem. Only thing is you must keep the top on or it will get hard and will be useless (lesson learned with the white and brown to this.) I also realized that with the other brand pencils, if you don&#x27;t keep the top on them they get hard and is useless. It is sad that it&#x27;s not mentioned from any of the brands. I always blamed the pencils until now. Anywho, I would recommend this. I can say though that it stays on better than regular pencils but not perfect. I have yet to find that perfect pencil, and I doubt I will find the one that works best in the water line, but this comes close enough. I would definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand Amazon&#x27;s packaging policy. This item arrived in the box with another item. It wasn&#x27;t even wrapped separately. It was casually tossed into the box with no care. Not worth the time re-ordering and talking to customer service.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;m willing to buy. Goes on smooth and stays on</li>
            <li> Easy to put, doesn&#x27;t smudge, stays on well, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> This is a great liner, highly pigmented.  It goes on very smoothlyâ€¦ very creamy formula for a pencil.  And the black is very black.  Great liner at a great price.</li>
            <li> NYX is better than MAC and a fraction of the price! This pencil glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t budge until I wash my face at night!</li>
            <li> The cap was so tight, I couldn&#x27;t get it off.  It ended up breaking.</li>
            <li> Not for me. I can&#x27;t stand the easy glide and softness of this product. Love NYX, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth liner, the color is a real black, but in my case it tend to smudge a little bit, but still a great option.</li>
            <li> Jet Black is right. The color of this pencil to sum it up in one word is like, \\&quot;Wow\\&quot; Even though I have been using NYX cosmetics for a couple of years now I am still amazed at the quality and care in design every time I try something new . The makeup is more than good it&#x27;s fantastic and reasonably priced so I don&#x27;t feel too guilty when I add new NYX items to my makeup collection. I use the NYX Cosmetics Slide on Pencil almost daily on my lower lash line to define my eyes. For my typical work day routine I will put the Jet Black Slide on Pencil on just my lower lash line to mid eye and then smudge it out with my ELF smudge brush and the affect is beautiful and so simple.  The color of the Slide on Pencil is pure black with no sparkle. I often wear the pencil on my lower lash line alone sans any eye shadow with a couple of coats of black mascara some foundation and a little bronzer and that would be the whole look.  This pencil can be a little runny so if you have problems with watery eyes you may want to carry this in your purse because after about 3-4 hours of wear I find that it smudges off in the corners of my eyes. The reason I have taken off one star because the formula is really thin. I do have to use a q-tip with this pencil every time to clean up smudges. This could also be helped by setting it with a black matte shadow.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE EYELINER EVER! Good price, lasts forever, and all day wear! Will buy again and again! Just make sure you have a good quality sharpener so you don&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth. good eyeliner</li>
            <li> It works really well. Affordable. Came to me quick! Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> A great product by Nyx! I only use it for the lower lash line, I use a liquid liner for my top lid. but it&#x27;s great and stands up to my watery eyes without running!</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s smooth and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly and STAYS where you put it. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pigmented eye pencil, just what I was looking for. I love how this eye pencil glides on my eyes too.</li>
            <li> Well, I messed up a while back when I visited my local Ulta. I had tried an eyeliner pencil of a girlfriend&#x27;s and LOVED the way it looked. It was a deep purple, very vibrant, glided easily over my lids - I wanted it. I checked with her after the liner held up through the night, and she said it was from the NYC brand. So I promptly went out and bought an NYX pencil. Duh! It was immediately recognizable that this pencil was not what I used previously, and when I texted my friend back, she pointed out the error of my way. I really, really don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product. I bought the purple - going for the look I had previously - and I had to continually run it over my eyes and press super hard for anything to even show it up. There was zero vibrancy, and the color turned out to be a very light silver-ish color. Usually I can at least find something good to say about anything, but I immediately threw this product away and would not recommend it for anyone. I&#x27;m also really disturbed that the product information talks about its lasting power- pretty impossible when it refuses to show up at all!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend and I agree - stays on like nothing else. Great smooth line and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice eyeliner I&#x27;ve used for years.  I usually get brown black and this time I got black.  It&#x27;s REALLY black.  Quality is great, sharpen nicely without creating a lot of dust that gets in your eyes like some pencils.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. All the product you get is what you see at the tip. Save yourself the money and buy something else or go higher end.</li>
            <li> Creamy, smooth and dark.</li>
            <li> Like it but not my absolute favorite.  Lasts a long time with very deep color. Does run on me which is what I&#x27;m not fond of. Overall struck me as one of those hit-or-miss products.</li>
            <li> The product barely comes off the pencil and have to press really hard. This is my first and last time I buy eye liner on Amazon. I rather go to Target so I can try to out on my hands before I buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this eyeliner with Sephora and I must say it&#x27;s amazing. Love love it glides on smooth</li>
            <li> This is my favorite black eyeliner, I can&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this pencil because I&#x27;ve never been able to use pencils since my eyelid skin is very thin and I hate that &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; feeling. This really does slide on (still have to be gentle though). The only thing is, it&#x27;s pretty waterproof and I&#x27;m finding that my regular eye makeup remover (Body Shop Chamomile) isn&#x27;t really strong enough, so I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a waterproof eye makeup remover. That said, especially at this price, this pencil is a keeper and I&#x27;ll be keeping my eyes open for other shades in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Easy to apply and stays all day. I would recommend buying this product!</li>
