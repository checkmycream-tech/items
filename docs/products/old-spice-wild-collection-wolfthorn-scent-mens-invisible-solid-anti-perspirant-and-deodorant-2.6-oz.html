            <li>I used that one can of Wolfthorn and loved it!</li>

            <li>and this was the one I liked best.</li>
            <li>so I purchase it on her via subscribe and save lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect smelling like Jim Bowie, but you will smell great.</li>

            <li>This is a great scent</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; deoderants smell too frilly and the antiperspirant just isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>I just wanna tackle him he smells so good.</li>
            <li>She actually really loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li>but a friend was raving about how good this smelled so on a whim I sniff tested one at the store.</li>
            <li>oh so good</li>
            <li>To sum it all up, this deodorant smells soo good, I would apply it in place of my cologne at times.</li>
            <li>Good price on sale</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>I do want to lick it because it smells so damn good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried many but not found any that were great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works better than women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Wolfthorn is a great scent, but it is not that rugged and manly (as the reviewer by the name \\&quot;Matt\\&quot; described well in his review): it has more of a citrus-y undercurrent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I choose this over the Fiji! ^.^  </li>
            <li>I can easily spend 2 hrs in the gym and still smell great.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells like a rose from the garden of Gethsemane.</li>
            <li>This smell surprisingly nice</li>
            <li>This smells kind of like candy and makes your armpits not smell like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get compliments from friends mostly women about how good it smells.</li>
            <li>Great and sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sniffed and told I smelled amazing more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>Harnessing the power of this deodorant, I will lead an army and reclaim the Iron Throne by astutely skipping Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s wedding!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>Best Old Spice sent.</li>
            <li>This is the best fragranced product that Old Spice has ever made and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Great lasting and smells good really good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and pleasant without any of that man perfume in it (most of the men&#x27;s deodorants smell like athletes and very strongly of man...</li>
            <li>This deodorant/antiperspirant smells great, it just doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job to perspiration as Old Spice&#x27;s Sweat Defense line.</li>
            <li>I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from</li>
            <li>and he was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It sure helps that I LOVE the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say, there is a notable difference in when my husband is wearing it versus when he is not.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot more like cherry taffy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man, and got this because its geared towards men, but after reading all the reviews of having a more fruity gender neutral smell, I was hesitant, but I&#x27;m 100%</li>
            <li>glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman and love using this.</li>
            <li>But I am a woman, and I love this....for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells - I liken it to sweetarts.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Just wish the spray would smell more like the deoderant then hair spray.</li>
            <li>Aside from performing what deodorants are tasks to do, the scent smells refreshing and emits an aura of confidence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good smell though, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, and Old Spice makes a good deoderant.</li>
            <li>I.have literally tried them.all and noticed I was sweating more and nothing was working.</li>
            <li>It does what it was created to do and more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li>closest thing I can describe the scent would be Hawaiian Punch &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li>Another favourite of mine, fresh and smells of the forest, and thistle, wish again we had these in Australia, you have it too good over there</li>
            <li>The name and wolf theme are comical attempts to sell the idea that this is a man&#x27;s man product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I would love to find wolfthorn in a soap.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and clean without being over-whelming.  </li>
            <li>Sweet and fruity; kind of a cotton candy/jelly bean thing going on.</li>
            <li>far as how it performs—they work great.  </li>
            <li>While it is epic, it can best be described as smelling EXACTLY like Skittles.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a strawberry lemonade sweet smell!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this scent tremendously.</li>
            <li>From a lady to you fellas: Believe me we&#x27;ll enjoy you wearing this scent.</li>
            <li>but they have since come out with some scents that are fantastic, and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>Go hug someone and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Smells light.</li>
            <li>Has a sort of light, orange and mango smell.</li>
            <li>However, I would enjoy if a man wore this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid gym-goer and had been told by many women  to ditch the woman&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant  and try a man&#x27;s to avoid the beading and it wearing off while working out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a scent I would have purchased if I&#x27;d bothered to smell it beforehand, and I am pretty sure it will neither empower me to rally an army nor channel wolf-like awesomeness.</li>
            <li>Nothing depicts the manly man more then the humorous Old Spice commercials; not even Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But like a clean candy smell.</li>
            <li>This kept my pits dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely interesting, but it works well and a lot of people notice and make (positive) comments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bear one smells a bit more masculine but does have a lot of sweet layers to it, so i would recommend it more for men than women.</li>
            <li>The entire profile, as far as I can tell, is a very pleasant and unique scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I emailed P&amp;G their parent company to complain, since Old Spice has no customer service of their own.</li>
            <li>It smells good, neutral enough that I would label it unisex.</li>
            <li>This is true if manly men like smelling a bit like candy.  </li>
            <li>This particular one lasts 24 hours or more.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s kind of hard to review deoderant since everyone has different tastes, but I&#x27;ll do my best.  </li>
            <li>It apparently could make me smell nice to ladies, though, so</li>
            <li>I use the Wolfthorn Body wash and body spray and a get a good smell all day long.</li>
            <li>so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!</li>
            <li>Amazing and the smell last all day without being overbearing.</li>
            <li>but I love all of the wild collection scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>A friend of mines forwarded me a humorous article about the Old Spice product posted on ManPossibe.com; a men&#x27;s grooming site that&#x27;s on the rise to internet popularity.</li>
            <li>but it smells like Starburst, which I guess is pretty cool...</li>
            <li>I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, but not in the way that most female scents smell sweet.</li>
            <li>Liked the smell before I purchased it, however wearing it is a different story.  </li>
            <li>I love The smell of the Old Spice Wolfthorn kinda smells like candy.</li>
            <li>Scent is far from manly, it is more feminine than anything.</li>
            <li>and I love the old spice line.</li>
            <li>So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
            <li>This actually smells refreshing, light, and dare I say, girly.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Definetly my favorite scent from old spice.</li>
            <li>so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!t deodorant.  </li>
            <li>In the store it smelled good and clean, maybe a little manly.</li>
            <li>Saw this on a beauty blog as a great deodorant for women and it is true and works much better than secret or dove!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
            <li>I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
            <li>Old Spice never had been for me because it kind of smelled like old man...</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, and it helps keep me dry.</li>
            <li>But if you enjoy something light, citrusy, and overall sweet/pleasant, then get this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine my husband wearing a scent like this, but for my daughter she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>&quot; First thing first</li>
            <li>It is actually up there with some of my favorite names of all time, including Ferdinand Foch,</li>
            <li>One time I forgot to wear this after a hot day, I had a date that night with this gal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about 3 trips to the gym for me to become an avid promoter of this product.</li>
            <li>But I purchased a Wolfthorn deodorant stick, and it smelled exactly like Fruit Punch.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  </li>
            <li>OK, there is only one thing that describes the scent of this one, Gummy Bears.</li>
            <li>Love the deodorant though I wish i would have gotten another one because now me and my roommate smell the same....</li>
            <li>I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>This was a refreshing New scent for old spice&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and dry and my sweetheart love the way I smell.</li>
            <li>Just so we&#x27;re clear, this smells like original Juicy Fruit gum.</li>
            <li>I cant stand the original old spice smell</li>
            <li>Definitely a unique smell in the line of Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me, then the initial attention grabber about the Old Spice brand isn&#x27;t in the products themselves, but rather the One of A Kind commercials they produce.</li>
            <li>At first, it goes on super fruity pebbles, but then after some time, it becomes more sweet and complex.  </li>
            <li>little sweet, but ok for man or woman.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34; either - very gender neutral imo.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I guess it has that going for it, but for me, I don&#x27;t really want to smell like a roll of Smarties all day.</li>
            <li>behold it work like a charm and smell very feminen which i like i would deffinitely recomment this product because it save me some embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li>Unusual smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like wolfthorns much, either.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite smell of the series but be careful when getting it some is just deodorant and not antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I can’t imagine any man really wanting to smell like Tropical Punch Koolaid.</li>
            <li>If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this daily for about 4 months and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s because of my sensitive skin, and if that isn&#x27;t an issue for you then the price and quality of smell are well worth it.</li>
            <li>As for the deodorant itself, it does not crumble and it rarely rubs off on the front of your shirt (if you do do deoderant first and shirt second).  </li>
            <li>I usually use men&#x27;s deodorant, because let&#x27;s face it, it is far superior to women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>seriously, I was tempted to lick it because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Wolfthorn Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant is by far my favorite deodorant in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received mixed reviews from others but continue to buy it because I like the smell and no one has ever been kicked out of someone&#x27;s bed for smelling sweet and edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>decent scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it smells like the opposite of wolves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended to all men.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for men or women.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so many brands, so little time.</li>
            <li>kind of hard to explain).  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive pits, this may be a bit much for you.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear mild citrusy scents or things that just smell like clean.</li>
            <li>, it also lasts longer than normal deodorants.</li>
            <li>They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  </li>
            <li>My main deo is Old Spice sweat defense.</li>
            <li>The have about the same heft as those, so they&#x27;re probably filled with the same stuff.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff smells yummy!</li>
            <li>(OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  </li>
            <li>Wolfthorn is the new scent in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection.</li>
            <li>Prior to making the move to Old Spice, I was purely a Degree guy.  </li>
            <li>I smelled every old spice they had, looking for the manliest scent and comparing each of them them to swagger.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter loves wolves, thought we would smell it out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>I never would have even considered buying an Old Spice scented anything</li>
            <li>I shall purchase this, and channel the epic power of the wolf through my armpits.</li>
            <li>so i decided to try a man deodarant and i try wolfhorn old spice and lord</li>
            <li>Upon reading the article, I decided to give the Wild Collection Wolfthorn</li>
            <li>Naturally, I threw it in the dumpster.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level</li>
            <li>I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
            <li>you prefer the old Old Spice smell, then I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>When I bought this, the name led me to believe it would be epic and manly.</li>
            <li>The entire smell profile of the complete line is very pleasant, subtle, and not as feminine as some people would suggest, to me at least.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that the smell is slightly different to the body spray /: they should probably higher another smell tester person...</li>
            <li>I had spent too much time sniffing antiperspirant products before I got to this one.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and  not too strong.</li>
            <li>Old spice is the only deodorant that my husband can wear that actually stops his perspiration.  </li>
            <li>Recent convert, I smelled the entire Old Spice line in the store</li>
            <li>I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to.</li>
            <li>I am not claiming that this is a good or a bad thing.</li>

            <li> and this was the one I liked best.</li>
            <li> so I purchase it on her via subscribe and save lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect smelling like Jim Bowie, but you will smell great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of Wolfthorn body spray because another guy had it and it smelled great.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great.  </li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; deoderants smell too frilly and the antiperspirant just isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> I just wanna tackle him he smells so good.</li>
            <li> She actually really loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li> but a friend was raving about how good this smelled so on a whim I sniff tested one at the store.</li>
            <li> oh so good</li>
            <li> To sum it all up, this deodorant smells soo good, I would apply it in place of my cologne at times.</li>
            <li> Good price on sale</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> I do want to lick it because it smells so damn good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried many but not found any that were great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works better than women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Wolfthorn is a great scent, but it is not that rugged and manly (as the reviewer by the name \\&quot;Matt\\&quot; described well in his review): it has more of a citrus-y undercurrent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I choose this over the Fiji! ^.^  </li>
            <li> I can easily spend 2 hrs in the gym and still smell great.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells like a rose from the garden of Gethsemane.</li>
            <li> This smell surprisingly nice</li>
            <li> This smells kind of like candy and makes your armpits not smell like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get compliments from friends mostly women about how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Great and sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sniffed and told I smelled amazing more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> Harnessing the power of this deodorant, I will lead an army and reclaim the Iron Throne by astutely skipping Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s wedding!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Best Old Spice sent.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragranced product that Old Spice has ever made and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great lasting and smells good really good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and pleasant without any of that man perfume in it (most of the men&#x27;s deodorants smell like athletes and very strongly of man...</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant smells great, it just doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job to perspiration as Old Spice&#x27;s Sweat Defense line.</li>
            <li> I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from</li>
            <li> and he was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It sure helps that I LOVE the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say, there is a notable difference in when my husband is wearing it versus when he is not.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot more like cherry taffy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and got this because its geared towards men, but after reading all the reviews of having a more fruity gender neutral smell, I was hesitant, but I&#x27;m 100%</li>
            <li> glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman and love using this.</li>
            <li> But I am a woman, and I love this....for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this smells - I liken it to sweetarts.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Just wish the spray would smell more like the deoderant then hair spray.</li>
            <li> Aside from performing what deodorants are tasks to do, the scent smells refreshing and emits an aura of confidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smell though, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, and Old Spice makes a good deoderant.</li>
            <li> I.have literally tried them.all and noticed I was sweating more and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> It does what it was created to do and more.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li> closest thing I can describe the scent would be Hawaiian Punch &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li> Another favourite of mine, fresh and smells of the forest, and thistle, wish again we had these in Australia, you have it too good over there</li>
            <li> The name and wolf theme are comical attempts to sell the idea that this is a man&#x27;s man product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I would love to find wolfthorn in a soap.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice and clean without being over-whelming.  </li>
            <li> Sweet and fruity; kind of a cotton candy/jelly bean thing going on.</li>
            <li> far as how it performs—they work great.  </li>
            <li> While it is epic, it can best be described as smelling EXACTLY like Skittles.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a strawberry lemonade sweet smell!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this scent tremendously.</li>
            <li> From a lady to you fellas: Believe me we&#x27;ll enjoy you wearing this scent.</li>
            <li> but they have since come out with some scents that are fantastic, and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> Go hug someone and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Smells light.</li>
            <li> Has a sort of light, orange and mango smell.</li>
            <li> However, I would enjoy if a man wore this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid gym-goer and had been told by many women  to ditch the woman&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant  and try a man&#x27;s to avoid the beading and it wearing off while working out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a scent I would have purchased if I&#x27;d bothered to smell it beforehand, and I am pretty sure it will neither empower me to rally an army nor channel wolf-like awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Nothing depicts the manly man more then the humorous Old Spice commercials; not even Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But like a clean candy smell.</li>
            <li> This kept my pits dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely interesting, but it works well and a lot of people notice and make (positive) comments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bear one smells a bit more masculine but does have a lot of sweet layers to it, so i would recommend it more for men than women.</li>
            <li> The entire profile, as far as I can tell, is a very pleasant and unique scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I emailed P&amp;G their parent company to complain, since Old Spice has no customer service of their own.</li>
            <li> It smells good, neutral enough that I would label it unisex.</li>
            <li> This is true if manly men like smelling a bit like candy.  </li>
            <li> This particular one lasts 24 hours or more.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s kind of hard to review deoderant since everyone has different tastes, but I&#x27;ll do my best.  </li>
            <li> It apparently could make me smell nice to ladies, though, so</li>
            <li> I use the Wolfthorn Body wash and body spray and a get a good smell all day long.</li>
            <li> so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!</li>
            <li> Amazing and the smell last all day without being overbearing.</li>
            <li> but I love all of the wild collection scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> A friend of mines forwarded me a humorous article about the Old Spice product posted on ManPossibe.com; a men&#x27;s grooming site that&#x27;s on the rise to internet popularity.</li>
            <li> but it smells like Starburst, which I guess is pretty cool...</li>
            <li> I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells sweet, but not in the way that most female scents smell sweet.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell before I purchased it, however wearing it is a different story.  </li>
            <li> I love The smell of the Old Spice Wolfthorn kinda smells like candy.</li>
            <li> Scent is far from manly, it is more feminine than anything.</li>
            <li> and I love the old spice line.</li>
            <li> So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
            <li> This actually smells refreshing, light, and dare I say, girly.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Definetly my favorite scent from old spice.</li>
            <li> so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!t deodorant.  </li>
            <li> In the store it smelled good and clean, maybe a little manly.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a beauty blog as a great deodorant for women and it is true and works much better than secret or dove!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
            <li> I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
            <li> Old Spice never had been for me because it kind of smelled like old man...</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, and it helps keep me dry.</li>
            <li> But if you enjoy something light, citrusy, and overall sweet/pleasant, then get this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine my husband wearing a scent like this, but for my daughter she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> &quot; First thing first</li>
            <li> It is actually up there with some of my favorite names of all time, including Ferdinand Foch,</li>
            <li> One time I forgot to wear this after a hot day, I had a date that night with this gal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about 3 trips to the gym for me to become an avid promoter of this product.</li>
            <li> But I purchased a Wolfthorn deodorant stick, and it smelled exactly like Fruit Punch.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  </li>
            <li> OK, there is only one thing that describes the scent of this one, Gummy Bears.</li>
            <li> Love the deodorant though I wish i would have gotten another one because now me and my roommate smell the same....</li>
            <li> I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> This was a refreshing New scent for old spice&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and dry and my sweetheart love the way I smell.</li>
            <li> Just so we&#x27;re clear, this smells like original Juicy Fruit gum.</li>
            <li> I cant stand the original old spice smell</li>
            <li> Definitely a unique smell in the line of Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, then the initial attention grabber about the Old Spice brand isn&#x27;t in the products themselves, but rather the One of A Kind commercials they produce.</li>
            <li> At first, it goes on super fruity pebbles, but then after some time, it becomes more sweet and complex.  </li>
            <li> little sweet, but ok for man or woman.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34; either - very gender neutral imo.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I guess it has that going for it, but for me, I don&#x27;t really want to smell like a roll of Smarties all day.</li>
            <li> behold it work like a charm and smell very feminen which i like i would deffinitely recomment this product because it save me some embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> Unusual smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like wolfthorns much, either.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell of the series but be careful when getting it some is just deodorant and not antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I can’t imagine any man really wanting to smell like Tropical Punch Koolaid.</li>
            <li> If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for about 4 months and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s because of my sensitive skin, and if that isn&#x27;t an issue for you then the price and quality of smell are well worth it.</li>
            <li> As for the deodorant itself, it does not crumble and it rarely rubs off on the front of your shirt (if you do do deoderant first and shirt second).  </li>
            <li> I usually use men&#x27;s deodorant, because let&#x27;s face it, it is far superior to women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> seriously, I was tempted to lick it because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Wolfthorn Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant is by far my favorite deodorant in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received mixed reviews from others but continue to buy it because I like the smell and no one has ever been kicked out of someone&#x27;s bed for smelling sweet and edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> decent scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it smells like the opposite of wolves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended to all men.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for men or women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so many brands, so little time.</li>
            <li> kind of hard to explain).  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive pits, this may be a bit much for you.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear mild citrusy scents or things that just smell like clean.</li>
            <li> , it also lasts longer than normal deodorants.</li>
            <li> They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  </li>
            <li> My main deo is Old Spice sweat defense.</li>
            <li> The have about the same heft as those, so they&#x27;re probably filled with the same stuff.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff smells yummy!</li>
            <li> (OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  </li>
            <li> Wolfthorn is the new scent in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection.</li>
            <li> Prior to making the move to Old Spice, I was purely a Degree guy.  </li>
            <li> I smelled every old spice they had, looking for the manliest scent and comparing each of them them to swagger.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter loves wolves, thought we would smell it out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> I never would have even considered buying an Old Spice scented anything</li>
            <li> I shall purchase this, and channel the epic power of the wolf through my armpits.</li>
            <li> so i decided to try a man deodarant and i try wolfhorn old spice and lord</li>
            <li> Upon reading the article, I decided to give the Wild Collection Wolfthorn</li>
            <li> Naturally, I threw it in the dumpster.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level</li>
            <li> I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
            <li> you prefer the old Old Spice smell, then I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, the name led me to believe it would be epic and manly.</li>
            <li> The entire smell profile of the complete line is very pleasant, subtle, and not as feminine as some people would suggest, to me at least.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the smell is slightly different to the body spray /: they should probably higher another smell tester person...</li>
            <li> I had spent too much time sniffing antiperspirant products before I got to this one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and  not too strong.</li>
            <li> Old spice is the only deodorant that my husband can wear that actually stops his perspiration.  </li>
            <li> Recent convert, I smelled the entire Old Spice line in the store</li>
            <li> I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to.</li>
            <li> I am not claiming that this is a good or a bad thing.</li>
            <li> How is the Wild Collection different than other deodorants?</li>
            <li> The deodorant could be said to smell slightly feminine or unisex, but all other variant products certainly did not have me concerned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having recently returned to the local gym, my ultimate goal was to not smell like the typical Axe-infested locker room after each workout.</li>
            <li> Guys in my maintenance lab are eyeing me.... strangely.  </li>
            <li> It smells strange after a while if you have hairyish pits???</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about it not being &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, because believe me the only ones who care if you smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; or not are other men.</li>
            <li> Definitely like a fruit Starburst or Skittle as other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties.</li>
            <li> Very strong to block bad armpit smell.</li>
            <li> However since making the change, I have little to no regrets.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say,,,,that won&#x27;t happen again, and I&#x27;m single and wear this always.</li>
            <li> So unless you&#x27;re trying to impress other men with your manly scent (nothing wrong with that), this deodorant is fantastic.</li>
            <li> No more Old Spice products for me.</li>
            <li> I use the sweat defense during the day and my pits stay dry!</li>
            <li> I was sitting at my desk the other day wondering WHO was chewing bubble gum all day long.</li>
            <li> Once that can of Wolfthorn body spray was empty</li>
            <li> It smells like a pink starburst candy.  </li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t know if I want to smell like a pink starburst.  </li>
            <li> My tongue is bitter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a manly scent at all.</li>
            <li> Based on other recommendations by women, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Other than smelling</li>
            <li> The other island scents are merely average.</li>
            <li> you’d just stroll down the men’s care aisle and look for the antiperspirant/deodorant that had the coolest packaging with some sort of name like “SPORT EXTREME XXL MAGNUM BLASTER”.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to Matterhorn: that at least truly smells of Ice, Wind &amp; Freedom.</li>
            <li> I’m not going to even try to explain what it smells like, because I would do a horrible job at it, but suffice to say it just smells good.  </li>
            <li> I just mean it&#x27;s less common than other Old Spice smells.</li>
            <li> other deodorants leave me sweating again after a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I have a little sweat on my forehead</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unique smell too, not unique like a musty shipwreck latrine pulled out of the ocean.</li>
            <li> This product will transform my pits into the manly underarms of Robb Stark.</li>
            <li> I saw this at a Rite-aid and was tired of shelling out tons of money for female deodorant that smelled like peaches but did nothing to stop my sweat/odor.</li>
            <li> suppose if you smelled like honey mustard you could run into trouble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not a huge fan of this smell.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day when I first tried it out, I came to find out that it is almost impossible to wash away in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So I am not sure why something that says &#x27;For Nocturnal Creatures&#x27; on the lid would smell like Gummy Bears, but hey, who am I to judge if that is what  you want to smell like.</li>
            <li> Heck, I’m sitting at Everest base camp right now wearing nothing but boxers in a chair made of snowballs</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an add on item which means you have to spend at least $25</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, and all the female ones I saw smelled like disgusting baby powder.</li>
            <li> Little weird, but affectionate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She looks up at me with a confused look and says, &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a mix of ladies&#x27; Secret and fabric softener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but this smell can turn badly with my pits  after 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I think the imagery on the container fails to convey the fact that this is a fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life have had an allergic reaction to anything whatsoever, but this was just absurd that after wearing it all day, I get a bad rash and allergic reaction once attempting to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I will be very sad if this product gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> the smell is BAD.   </li>
            <li> and you can base your decision on this.</li>

            <li> Best pit stick on planet earth!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend asked me to pick up some deodorant from the store because the blue dye in his &#x27;swagger&#x27; was making him itchy. I smelled every old spice they had, looking for the manliest scent and comparing each of them them to swagger. When I came across wolfthorn I struggled. This is not manly but its what I want my man to smell like. It smells like fruit roll-ups! He took a whiff when I got home and he was pleased with it. I smelled it on him today and had to hold him extra close. For me, this does what those axe commercials advertise. I just wanna tackle him he smells so good.</li>
            <li> Old spice is the only deodorant that my husband can wear that actually stops his perspiration.  It sure helps that I LOVE the way it smells.  I cant stand the original old spice smell but I love all of the wild collection scents.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time. Let&#x27;s just say, there is a notable difference in when my husband is wearing it versus when he is not.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter loves wolves, thought we would smell it out of curiosity. She actually really loved the smell of it. Smells like skittles to me. I can&#x27;t imagine my husband wearing a scent like this, but for my daughter she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Recent convert, I smelled the entire Old Spice line in the store and this was the one I liked best. The deodorant variant of this scent is like a tropical orange creamsicle type scent. The body wash, shampoo, and body spray are all slightly different, and this deodorant is the sweetest. The entire profile, as far as I can tell, is a very pleasant and unique scent that is not overpowering. The deodorant could be said to smell slightly feminine or unisex, but all other variant products certainly did not have me concerned. The entire smell profile of the complete line is very pleasant, subtle, and not as feminine as some people would suggest, to me at least.</li>
            <li> From a lady to you fellas: Believe me we&#x27;ll enjoy you wearing this scent. Don&#x27;t worry about it not being &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, because believe me the only ones who care if you smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; or not are other men. So unless you&#x27;re trying to impress other men with your manly scent (nothing wrong with that), this deodorant is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl. I usually wear mild citrusy scents or things that just smell like clean. I never would have even considered buying an Old Spice scented anything but a friend was raving about how good this smelled so on a whim I sniff tested one at the store. Oh my god, it smells like candy and sexiness and rainbows. I have this on subscribe and save now. I&#x27;ve been sniffed and told I smelled amazing more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deodorant ever!! My son received this as a gift from his girlfriend and I couldn&#x27;t believe the smell. I&#x27;m an avid gym-goer and had been told by many women  to ditch the woman&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant  and try a man&#x27;s to avoid the beading and it wearing off while working out. I&#x27;d tried many but not found any that were great. Well, this is it! I can easily spend 2 hrs in the gym and still smell great. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34; either - very gender neutral imo. Highly highly recommend! I can never find it locally either (always sold out!!) so I purchase it on her via subscribe and save lol so we now have a stock pile of it.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like wolves at all.  It smells a lot more like cherry taffy.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it smells like the opposite of wolves.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff smells yummy! I&#x27;m a man, and got this because its geared towards men, but after reading all the reviews of having a more fruity gender neutral smell, I was hesitant, but I&#x27;m 100% glad I got it.  At first, it goes on super fruity pebbles, but then after some time, it becomes more sweet and complex.  Definitely a unique smell in the line of Old Spice.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a woman and love using this. It smells great and works better than women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I like this brand a lot. I use the Wolfthorn Body wash and body spray and a get a good smell all day long. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Prior to making the move to Old Spice, I was purely a Degree guy.  However since making the change, I have little to no regrets.</li>
            <li> Wolfthorn is the new scent in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection. How is the Wild Collection different than other deodorants? I have no idea...so many brands, so little time. Anyway Wolfthorn describes itself as \\&quot;For Nocturnal Creatures.\\&quot; First thing first: Wolfthorn is the best name I&#x27;ve heard since Indiana Jones. It is actually up there with some of my favorite names of all time, including Ferdinand Foch, \\&quot;The Last of the Mohicans,\\&quot; Voltaire, and the Millenium Falcon. Wolfthorn is a great scent, but it is not that rugged and manly (as the reviewer by the name \\&quot;Matt\\&quot; described well in his review): it has more of a citrus-y undercurrent. Smells like a rose from the garden of Gethsemane. Don&#x27;t expect smelling like Jim Bowie, but you will smell great.</li>
            <li> One time I forgot to wear this after a hot day, I had a date that night with this gal. Let&#x27;s just say,,,,that won&#x27;t happen again, and I&#x27;m single and wear this always.</li>
            <li> Walking through the store, I saw this on the shelf. &amp;#34;Oh hey, deodorant,&amp;#34; I said to myself. &amp;#34;I&#x27;m almost out. This has a wolf on it. Wolves are awesome. I shall purchase this, and channel the epic power of the wolf through my armpits. This product will transform my pits into the manly underarms of Robb Stark. Harnessing the power of this deodorant, I will lead an army and reclaim the Iron Throne by astutely skipping Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s wedding!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, well, it smells like freaking candy. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It just smells like candy. It&#x27;s not a scent I would have purchased if I&#x27;d bothered to smell it beforehand, and I am pretty sure it will neither empower me to rally an army nor channel wolf-like awesomeness. It apparently could make me smell nice to ladies, though, so I guess it has that going for it, but for me, I don&#x27;t really want to smell like a roll of Smarties all day.</li>
            <li> But I am a woman, and I love this....for me.  Based on other recommendations by women, I decided to give it a try. I usually use men&#x27;s deodorant, because let&#x27;s face it, it is far superior to women&#x27;s.  I love the way this smells - I liken it to sweetarts.  But I don&#x27;t smell it on  myself during the day, because it does its job as an antiperspirant.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> This smell surprisingly nice</li>
            <li> Im a woman and i have tried all woman deodorant and non of them prevent my underarm odor so i decided to try a man deodarant and i try wolfhorn old spice and lord behold it work like a charm and smell very feminen which i like i would deffinitely recomment this product because it save me some embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> I like the scent. It lasts all day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant smells great, it just doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job to perspiration as Old Spice&#x27;s Sweat Defense line.</li>
            <li> Smells very delicious. Just wish the spray would smell more like the deoderant then hair spray. I have bought 2.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s kind of hard to review deoderant since everyone has different tastes, but I&#x27;ll do my best.  Old Spice never had been for me because it kind of smelled like old man...but they have since come out with some scents that are fantastic, and this is one of them.  To me, wolfthorn smells like candy!  It&#x27;s sweet and pleasant without any of that man perfume in it (most of the men&#x27;s deodorants smell like athletes and very strongly of man...kind of hard to explain).  As for the deodorant itself, it does not crumble and it rarely rubs off on the front of your shirt (if you do do deoderant first and shirt second).  I had some rash problems with the gel version of this scent, but have no problem with this antipersperant.</li>
            <li> I need an antiperspirant. I can&#x27;t be out in the summer without something like this. This works and I like the labeling and name. It&#x27;s fun. It smells like candy. Amazon&#x27;s price is 2 dollars cheaper than a CVS or Walgreens but it&#x27;s an add on item which means you have to spend at least $25</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li> And why are you reading it? This smells kind of like candy and makes your armpits not smell like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise to never write another deodorant review if you never read one again. Go hug someone and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I was sitting at my desk the other day wondering WHO was chewing bubble gum all day long. Then I realized that it was my armpits.</li>
            <li> Best Old Spice sent. it&#x27;s like gummy bears. i wanna eat it! I think it ACTUALLY drives women nuts.</li>
            <li> Other than smelling oh so good, it also lasts longer than normal deodorants. I will be very sad if this product gets discontinued. I will end up having stinky pits.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells fruity</li>
            <li> If you are like me, then the initial attention grabber about the Old Spice brand isn&#x27;t in the products themselves, but rather the One of A Kind commercials they produce. Nothing depicts the manly man more then the humorous Old Spice commercials; not even Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having recently returned to the local gym, my ultimate goal was to not smell like the typical Axe-infested locker room after each workout. A friend of mines forwarded me a humorous article about the Old Spice product posted on ManPossibe.com; a men&#x27;s grooming site that&#x27;s on the rise to internet popularity. Upon reading the article, I decided to give the Wild Collection Wolfthorn a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 3 trips to the gym for me to become an avid promoter of this product. The Old Spice Wolfthorn Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant is by far my favorite deodorant in Old Spice&#x27;s Wild Collection. Aside from performing what deodorants are tasks to do, the scent smells refreshing and emits an aura of confidence. To sum it all up, this deodorant smells soo good, I would apply it in place of my cologne at times. If you are in the market for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t smell like the generic locker room, then definitely try this out. I highly recommended to all men.</li>
            <li> Unusual smell. Sweet and fruity; kind of a cotton candy/jelly bean thing going on. It&#x27;s a good smell though, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, and Old Spice makes a good deoderant.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;•It smells like cobra fangs.&amp;#34; No, no it does not.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like wolfthorns much, either.  Smells like that sickly-sweet juicy fruit bubblegum.  Guys in my maintenance lab are eyeing me.... strangely.  I&#x27;m switching back to Matterhorn: that at least truly smells of Ice, Wind &amp; Freedom.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the body spray or cologne - but it smells like Starburst, which I guess is pretty cool...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell of the series but be careful when getting it some is just deodorant and not antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;The silver cap is the antiperspirant the red cap is just deodorant</li>
            <li> I.have literally tried them.all and noticed I was sweating more and nothing was working. This worked well didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and my wife even uses it</li>
            <li> I saw this at a Rite-aid and was tired of shelling out tons of money for female deodorant that smelled like peaches but did nothing to stop my sweat/odor. I bought this and the bear one, and both are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bear one smells a bit more masculine but does have a lot of sweet layers to it, so i would recommend it more for men than women. But I&#x27;m wearing it now and all my girlfriends say I smell like oranges, so yay for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This stuff smells like candy and amazingness. I put it on and everyone complements me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If my guy wore this I would never leave alone because he would smell SOOOOOO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s a great product. It does what it was created to do and more. I would recommend it to anyone because it works for everyone.</li>
            <li> Good price on sale and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of Wolfthorn body spray because another guy had it and it smelled great. I used that one can of Wolfthorn and loved it! But I purchased a Wolfthorn deodorant stick, and it smelled exactly like Fruit Punch. Yuk! Is this a joke? Naturally, I threw it in the dumpster. Once that can of Wolfthorn body spray was empty I purchased another can, and to my shock, it too smells like freaking Fruit Punch! Yuk! Their quality control is abysmal. No more Old Spice products for me. I emailed P&amp;G their parent company to complain, since Old Spice has no customer service of their own. And I am convinced that some of the reviews here are bogus. I can’t imagine any man really wanting to smell like Tropical Punch Koolaid.</li>
            <li> Great seller! On time and just as described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I switched from women&#x27;s deodorant to this and it&#x27;s much better and it has a surprising great unisex scent!</li>
            <li> I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—you’d just stroll down the men’s care aisle and look for the antiperspirant/deodorant that had the coolest packaging with some sort of name like “SPORT EXTREME XXL MAGNUM BLASTER”.  Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level and I didn’t have to bend over to read the label, but I picked up one of these and gave it a smell—wow.  I’m not going to even try to explain what it smells like, because I would do a horrible job at it, but suffice to say it just smells good.  It’s one of those things that you just have to smell for yourself.  I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy yourself one of each.  When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  Bearglove?  Wolfthorn? Hawkridge?”  They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  Although, I imagine if I bumped into a bear in the woods he probably wouldn’t smell anything like my deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it performs—they work great.  I “perspire” a lot.  Heck, I’m sitting at Everest base camp right now wearing nothing but boxers in a chair made of snowballs and I have a little sweat on my forehead (OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  I always use the antiperspirant/deodorant combo, the ones with the silver-colored caps—the red colored caps are just deodorant.  I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you’re shopping, give these a try.  I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!t deodorant.

            <li> Great scent, works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I am a female. Saw this on a beauty blog as a great deodorant for women and it is true and works much better than secret or dove!  Highly recommend for men or women. Smells light. But like a clean candy smell.</li>
            <li> decent scent. bummed on the white chalky makeup of it though.  probably won&#x27;t buy again...</li>
            <li> This is the best fragranced product that Old Spice has ever made and it lasts all day. I feel fresh and dry and my sweetheart love the way I smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works awesome. No pit stains, no stank. Wife loves this smell and buries her face in my chest/armpit. Little weird, but affectionate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unique smell too, not unique like a musty shipwreck latrine pulled out of the ocean. I just mean it&#x27;s less common than other Old Spice smells. The body wash and cologne match it well.</li>
            <li> Best.&lt;br /&gt;Smell.&lt;br /&gt;EVAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest thing I can describe the scent would be Hawaiian Punch &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great.  What else would you need?</li>
            <li> This was a refreshing New scent for old spice&lt;br /&gt;A little sweet, but ok for man or woman. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Definitely like a fruit Starburst or Skittle as other people have mentioned. I want another 20 of them ASAP just in case this scent is discontinued!</li>
            <li> Has a sort of light, orange and mango smell.</li>
            <li> Not a man&#x27;s deodorant</li>
            <li> I smell like a watermelon.</li>
            <li> MAAN THIS DEO IS SO DANG FRUITY&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I was tempted to lick it because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, and it helps keep me dry.</li>
            <li> It smells like a pink starburst candy.  I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  It smells good, I just don&#x27;t know if I want to smell like a pink starburst.  Deodorant is probably something you should try in the store before ordering online.  I think the imagery on the container fails to convey the fact that this is a fruity scent.  The imagery screams a musky scent.</li>
            <li> This is my fav deodorant of all TIME!!</li>
            <li> Just so we&#x27;re clear, this smells like original Juicy Fruit gum. I am not claiming that this is a good or a bad thing. I&#x27;m just saying that if you know what Juicy Fruit gum smells like, then you know what this smells like and you can base your decision on this. Does your ladyfriend think you should smell &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34;? Maybe she does. Maybe you should find out.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend kinda likes it, though.</li>
            <li> Another favourite of mine, fresh and smells of the forest, and thistle, wish again we had these in Australia, you have it too good over there</li>
            <li> OK, there is only one thing that describes the scent of this one, Gummy Bears. I had spent too much time sniffing antiperspirant products before I got to this one. In the store it smelled good and clean, maybe a little manly. Once I got home and my nose had time to recover, Gummy Bears.&lt;br /&gt;  As I was putting it on in the morning, is got a whiff of Gummy Bears, but did not think anything about it. I kept smelling Gummy Bears all day at work. Could not find where the smell was coming from. So, when I get home, I give my fiancée a hug. She looks up at me with a confused look and says, &amp;#34;Why do you smell like Gummy Bears?&amp;#34; Mystery solved. So I am not sure why something that says &#x27;For Nocturnal Creatures&#x27; on the lid would smell like Gummy Bears, but hey, who am I to judge if that is what  you want to smell like.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim when I saw they were on sale from SlickDeals. It smells sweet, but not in the way that most female scents smell sweet. I&#x27;ve used this daily for about 4 months and really enjoy it. It lasts all day and through a two hour workout, and probably would last even longer. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells like Skittles candy . I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is embarrassing. I&#x27;m a woman. A woman that sweats. &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; deoderants smell too frilly and the antiperspirant just isn&#x27;t very effective. This stuff is awesome. It smells good, neutral enough that I would label it unisex. And I&#x27;m not sweating! Hooray!</li>
            <li> If I could eat this product I could. If I could bathe in this product I would.  I do want to lick it because it smells so damn good.  My tongue is bitter.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell before I purchased it, however wearing it is a different story.  At the end of the day when I first tried it out, I came to find out that it is almost impossible to wash away in the shower.  Even using bar soap, shampoo, and even conditioner, the smell and the deodorant remained.  I blew it off as mayb. Afyer drying off it goes away, but when I went to bed, I started having a reaction to it.  I&#x27;ve never in my life have had an allergic reaction to anything whatsoever, but this was just absurd that after wearing it all day, I get a bad rash and allergic reaction once attempting to remove it.  No, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good item.</li>
            <li> Amazing and the smell last all day without being overbearing. Only downside is that the smell is slightly different to the body spray /: they should probably higher another smell tester person...</li>
            <li> I love The smell of the Old Spice Wolfthorn kinda smells like candy.I get compliments from friends mostly women about how good it smells.Very strong to block bad armpit smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a strawberry lemonade sweet smell! I&#x27;m glad I choose this over the Fiji! ^.^  8/4/2015 Update:  If you have sensitive pits, this may be a bit much for you.  It smells strange after a while if you have hairyish pits??? I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but this smell can turn badly with my pits  after 6 hours. Day 2, no way the smell is BAD.   I&#x27;ve shaved and I&#x27;m going to try it again.</li>
            <li> Yeah it works, but what were they thinking with this scent?  This is not manly and I was embarrassed to wear it.  It&#x27;s almost like a mix of ladies&#x27; Secret and fabric softener.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers and smells like fruity blueberries. Scent is far from manly, it is more feminine than anything. I would never buy this again. Just received the product yesterday, used it once and will be this away. Also contains ALUMINUM for those who haven&#x27;t seen.</li>
            <li> My main deo is Old Spice sweat defense. Why? Because I sweat a lot! I use the sweat defense during the day and my pits stay dry! I know these all say they last all day/night but I like to touch up and put something else on at night (shower in AM&#x27;s). I throw this (non sweat defense) on at night before bed and it keeps me smelling great all night, or so i&#x27;m told! This is a great scent and I love the old spice line. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The name and wolf theme are comical attempts to sell the idea that this is a man&#x27;s man product.  This is true if manly men like smelling a bit like candy.  I&#x27;ve received mixed reviews from others but continue to buy it because I like the smell and no one has ever been kicked out of someone&#x27;s bed for smelling sweet and edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you smelled like honey mustard you could run into trouble.  But stuff like candy, or molasses-rich barbeque sauce?  Delicious!  The ladies and lords will come from miles around to lick your manly candy-pits like the freaks you&#x27;ve turned them into.</li>
            <li> I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to. So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn. The other island scents are merely average. My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties. I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this stuff yet, but it looks just like the ones we got at Walgreens.  The have about the same heft as those, so they&#x27;re probably filled with the same stuff.  I have no reason to believe it won&#x27;t work as well as they do.</li>
            <li> This kept my pits dry and smelling great. Wolves on the outside of the container are a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not a huge fan of this smell.  Its fruity, which was counterintuitive to me based on the name.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best smelling deodorant I have ever owned. I&#x27;m a female, and all the female ones I saw smelled like disgusting baby powder. This actually smells refreshing, light, and dare I say, girly.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells girly. It&#x27;s not really a manly scent at all. However, I would enjoy if a man wore this.&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer the old Old Spice smell, then I don&#x27;t recommend this. But if you enjoy something light, citrusy, and overall sweet/pleasant, then get this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. the only problem I run into is that it is deoderant and anti perspirant. I just want deoderant.  But that&#x27;s because of my sensitive skin, and if that isn&#x27;t an issue for you then the price and quality of smell are well worth it.</li>
            <li> This thing smells like fruit punch, only a pedophile would use this stuff?</li>
            <li> Saves me a trip to walmart</li>
            <li> Love the deodorant though I wish i would have gotten another one because now me and my roommate smell the same....</li>
            <li> Good product. The fragrance is subtle and  not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great lasting and smells good really good product</li>
            <li> My husband and son both wear this deodorant/anti-antiperspirant.  I love the smell, it&#x27;s nice and clean without being over-whelming.  It&#x27;s not spicy.</li>
            <li> Almost a frutty smell.  I like it and so does my son.  I think we&#x27;ll try the body spray next.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, the name led me to believe it would be epic and manly. While it is epic, it can best be described as smelling EXACTLY like Skittles. It&#x27;s definitely interesting, but it works well and a lot of people notice and make (positive) comments. Nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my deodorant and tried this today.  Great and sweet smell.  I am enjoying this scent tremendously.</li>
            <li> Definetly my favorite scent from old spice. I would love to find wolfthorn in a soap. NOT the body wash but a bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other deodorants leave me sweating again after a few hours. This particular one lasts 24 hours or more. Great product</li>
