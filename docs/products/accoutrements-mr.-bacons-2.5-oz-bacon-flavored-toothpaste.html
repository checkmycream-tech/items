            <li>I thought it would be great practical joke, however, the smell is so potent as to deter possible victims from partaking.  </li>

            <li>Great white elephant gift!</li>
            <li>, fortunately I bought it as a gag gift for my son.</li>
            <li>great product brother loves it only thing is box was damaged</li>
            <li>If the answer is yes, then you&#x27;ll enjoy this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It was a fun joke, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>Everyone thought it was so funny!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the best whitening product around, but who buys bacon toothpaste for its whitening qualities?  </li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure after this, it&#x27;s all downhill from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every Christmas I get my guy a special bacon surprise, rather it is bacon soap or floss..</li>
            <li>Have no idea how it tastes, but it&#x27;s a gag gift, so that didn&#x27;t matter so much:)</li>
            <li>My daughter really wanted to try this toothpaste and was super excited about it!  </li>
            <li>Very fast service!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to give as a gift for other people!</li>
            <li>It is a strange but interesting bacon flavored toothpaste for sure.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recomend spending so much on a gag gift, but for my dentist husband who eats BACON all the time, it was pretty cute.</li>
            <li>This was a fun gag gift.  </li>
            <li>fun for Christmas stocking, but tastes aweful</li>
            <li>We both had to spit it right out for fear of throwing up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kids really had fun with this product</li>
            <li>Would be funny for a gag gift, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Among my most recent birthday&#x27;s gag gift, I spotted this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i first move to america</li>
            <li>toooo  funny as gag gift</li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail the package was pretty banged up.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Funny?</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Also, when this product shipped, it had been compressed so much so that a portion of this smelly solution was already squirted into the package.  </li>
            <li>This smells absolutely rancid</li>
            <li>The question is this, do you really want the flavor of bacon lingering in your mouth after brushing your teeth?  </li>
            <li>Well, it really taste like bacon, bacon pudding that is.</li>
            <li>, he likes it, but it is a bit too much for my liking..</li>
            <li>Tastes like real Bacon though.</li>
            <li>Next she told me she needed a new toothbrush because she could not get the bacon flavor or smell to come off of her old one, no matter how many times she ran it through boiling water.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is a clear brownish - red bacon color and smells strongly like bacon.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a White Elephant gift, and it was hilarious until we actually opened it.  </li>
            <li>I guess I would classify this item as gag gift worthy but don&#x27;t actually buy it to brush your teeth with.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival, though, the box was in pretty sad shape and required lots of tape to get it restored but other than that, I was very happy.</li>
            <li>I still have this toothpaste at home - still full, a long time after purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>Lopsided, torn...had to throw the box completely away.</li>
            <li>Also surprised there wasn&#x27;t a safety seal of some type over the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old gets this in his stocking every christmas.</li>
            <li>This was at first exciting for my husband, but he quickly grew tired of it and longed for his regular minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li>White elephant gift that my 14 yr old brother in law ended up with.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it could really taste like bacon but at least my brother will get a laugh.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> A little scared someone might have opened this, used it then taped it back up.</li>
            <li> Not only does this taste like bacon, but I&#x27;m down 30 pounds!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the taste</li>
            <li> This is not a real product.</li>
            <li> It kinda taste like bacon but not really.</li>
            <li> One of a number of small inexpensive gag white elephant gifts we got.  </li>
            <li> Since he likes bacon, I&#x27;d given him other bacon flavored creations like bacon cupcakes, bacon ice cream, etc.  </li>
            <li> so I bought this (and other Mr. Bacon products) as stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;m not sure what this stuff tastes like but its definitely not bacon.</li>
            <li> I was chrpnically late for work, partially because of the massive breakfasts I ate.</li>
            <li> Smells like bacon works like your average toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The only complaint my friend and I have is that the toothpaste tastes nothing like bacon.</li>
            <li> WE LLAAAUUUGGHHEEDD about it all day long!!!!!</li>
            <li> a little imitation</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel a bit nauseated because of the odor and because I spent $5.00 on something I won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a gag gift, but the 14 year old boy (extreme bacon lover) recipient wouldn&#x27;t even try it because it smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Its a small tube.</li>
            <li> After my heart attack, no more bacon for me.</li>
            <li> Um....... Not sure what to say.  </li>
            <li> It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li> My son is a bacon fanatic</li>
            <li> It was an expensive gag gift, as I believe I paid shipping; matched it with other bacon items to guy with everything.</li>
            <li> Then she brushed her teeth with it - she only used it once because it tasted so awful!  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea to brush your teeth with(common sense).</li>
            <li> but it was weird...</li>
            <li> A hefty person, I will admit that even I was skeptical about that diet&#x27;s health viability.</li>
            <li> I personally find it disgusting</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> If anything, it just takes like a weird mint flavor--perhaps mint</li>
            <li> bad taste that didn&#x27;t belong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never received a shipment this badly torn up.</li>
            <li> It is so bad.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s gone bad?</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size because I could had bought mint toothpaste and just put a bacon label and all for under $2.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but the taste was disgusting.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the packaging being so beaten up upon arrival.</li>
            <li> The stuff tastes horrible, but that was why I bought it as a gag gift</li>
            <li> Awful taste</li>
            <li> but it taste disgusting.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my granddaughter who is a bacon fan, thought it tasted awful.</li>
            <li> The smell was terrible, and when we opened it a bit of what looked like  grease came out.</li>

            <li> It was great for my gag gift</li>
            <li> I bought this as a prensent for my aunt that it was the funniest thing in the world.....WE LLAAAUUUGGHHEEDD about it all day long!!!!! We have been having a bacon war with the family!!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> This is not a toy and should probably be moved to health &amp; beauty. I liked the way it tasted and smelled. Very bacon-like and meaty :) YUM!</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend but he let me try it bc I was curious about the taste but it was weird... It tasted minty but I could tell they tried to make it bacon flavored. Its a small tube. I was disappointed in the size because I could had bought mint toothpaste and just put a bacon label and all for under $2.</li>
            <li> Kids really had fun with this product</li>
            <li> My daughter really wanted to try this toothpaste and was super excited about it!  When it arrived, she opened the tube and we saw that the toothpaste was completely white and that it smelled just like bacon bits.  Then she brushed her teeth with it - she only used it once because it tasted so awful!  Next she told me she needed a new toothbrush because she could not get the bacon flavor or smell to come off of her old one, no matter how many times she ran it through boiling water.  Would be funny for a gag gift, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Ew. This tasted nothing like bacon! It was just a gross looking paste. It literally made me was to vomit when I smelled it. But when I tried it I actually did!</li>
            <li> The stuff tastes horrible, but that was why I bought it as a gag gift haha.  I gave four stars because besides bacon and mint, another taste was present like a manufacturing... chemical.. I don&#x27;t know.. bad taste that didn&#x27;t belong.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my friend who obsessively brushes her teeth. The toothpaste is a clear brownish - red bacon color and smells strongly like bacon. My friend used it as soon as I gave it to her and said she likes it. I&#x27;ve seen her using it a couple of times since then.</li>
            <li> I still have this toothpaste at home - still full, a long time after purchasing it.  It was a novel idea but in reality brushing your teeth with a bacon flavored tooth paste is not that tasty.</li>
            <li> This is for my daughter so I cannot state if it tastes like bacon, but it does smell like it. I was very disappointed with the packaging being so beaten up upon arrival. It came in the regular mail and I&#x27;ve never received a shipment this badly torn up. The box had tape on both ends as if someone tried to fix it. Lopsided, torn...had to throw the box completely away. Also surprised there wasn&#x27;t a safety seal of some type over the toothpaste. A little scared someone might have opened this, used it then taped it back up.</li>
            <li> Great gag gift for someone who loves bacon but I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth with it</li>
            <li> So I had this problem. I was chrpnically late for work, partially because of the massive breakfasts I ate. About a pound of bacon per morning. I was trying to lose weight via Atkins. But I digress. A hefty person, I will admit that even I was skeptical about that diet&#x27;s health viability. After my heart attack, no more bacon for me. Among my most recent birthday&#x27;s gag gift, I spotted this toothpaste. What the heck. It&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;m getting to bacon&#x27;s wonderful smoky goodness again. I started using it two months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Not only does this taste like bacon, but I&#x27;m down 30 pounds! I have no desire for breakfast, if I brush with this. And I&#x27;m on time for work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! You&#x27;ve saved my life!</li>
            <li> Every morning I gargle with two beaten eggs. Now I smell like a country breakfast before leaving for work!! gotta try it!!</li>
            <li> Got 2 of these, one for a friend who loves bacon (but who doesn&#x27;t), and another for a white elephant gift. We tasted after he opened it and it does taste like bacon! a little imitation but I expected that, served it&#x27;s purpose wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste for my grandson for Christmas.  He loved the stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the best whitening product around, but who buys bacon toothpaste for its whitening qualities?  My grandson loved it!</li>
            <li> Smells like bacon! Couldn&#x27;t convince my son to try it though.</li>
            <li> Great white elephant gift!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it.  I am giving it as a gag gift to my brother.  I&#x27;m not sure it could really taste like bacon but at least my brother will get a laugh.</li>
            <li> Im a guy who likes bacon, A lot. I thought why not. Afterall, we&#x27;re in the middle of a bacon shortage. So I bought a couple of tubes. As I have recently learned. I have an addictive personality type.&lt;br /&gt;When my bacon toothpaste came in I was excited. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Long story short im up to 15 tubes a day. I&#x27;ve lost my job, my car, and if this rehab doesn&#x27;t work I will lose my family.&lt;br /&gt;curse you bacon toothpaste. I wish I had never tried you.</li>
            <li> They say the way to a man&#x27;s heart is through his stomach. I disagree. It&#x27;s through bacon breath. My guy makes me use this before a romantic night out on the town. The wafting smell of liquid smoke and pork on my lips makes his artery-clogged heart skip a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this is THE way land the guy of your dreams!</li>
            <li> My sister loves bacon so it was a great gag gift at Christmas,  Every one got a kick out of it.  It was hilarious.</li>
            <li> i buy this because i now like bacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first move to america i did not like bacon now i do!</li>
            <li> It is obviously a gag gift, but the 14 year old boy (extreme bacon lover) recipient wouldn&#x27;t even try it because it smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> This was at first exciting for my husband, but he quickly grew tired of it and longed for his regular minty toothpaste. Bacon toothpaste followed by mint mouthwash is not the best combo... It does seem like a quality product, though.</li>
            <li> One of a number of small inexpensive gag white elephant gifts we got.  This one got passed around the most so it was perfect.</li>
            <li> toooo  funny as gag gift</li>
            <li> This is not a real product. No one would ever use this on their teeth. It is so bad. You could use it as a greaser.</li>
            <li> Um....... Not sure what to say.  It&#x27;s toothpaste that tastes like bacon.  Ordered it as a gag gift and somehow I got stuck with it.  Have not tried it yet but it sure smells like bacon!</li>
            <li> Awful taste, fortunately I bought it as a gag gift for my son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for tricking people and funny to have around but it taste horible made me throw up. So make a friend taste it not u</li>
            <li> I used this as a gag gift for my brother, I hoped he liked it, I do not know if he will use it or not</li>
            <li> It kinda taste like bacon but not really. As it smells like ham and bacon but it taste disgusting.</li>
            <li> Box was damaged &amp; this was a xmas gift. I taped it to fix it enough to save it for wrapping.</li>
            <li> Very cute - and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> great product brother loves it only thing is box was damaged</li>
            <li> It was an expensive gag gift, as I believe I paid shipping; matched it with other bacon items to guy with everything.</li>
            <li> Very amusing gift for a friend. I personally find it disgusting but it&#x27;s great to give as a gift for other people!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great practical joke, however, the smell is so potent as to deter possible victims from partaking.  Also, when this product shipped, it had been compressed so much so that a portion of this smelly solution was already squirted into the package.  Overall, I feel a bit nauseated because of the odor and because I spent $5.00 on something I won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a bacon packed birthday present for a buddy of mine. He ran to the bathroom to try it as did I. It is a strange but interesting bacon flavored toothpaste for sure.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a White Elephant gift, and it was hilarious until we actually opened it.  This smells absolutely rancid</li>
            <li> Was given and received as a gag gift for two (2) bacon loving relatives.  They thought it was a hoot.  I have no idea if either of them ever used the product.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> My son believes that there is nothing that bacon won&#x27;t go well on or in.  Bought it for him fro Christmas and haven&#x27;t heard yet whether he believes that.</li>
            <li> Perfect gag gift.  My nephew couldn&#x27;t wait to use it until he tried it.  Look on face was priceless.</li>
            <li> It tastes and smells like dog food. But it was a good gag gift. When I received it in the mail the package was pretty banged up.</li>
            <li> Gave this bacon flavored toothpaste to my son as a gag gift.  Since he likes bacon, I&#x27;d given him other bacon flavored creations like bacon cupcakes, bacon ice cream, etc.  The toothpaste does have a smoky bacon flavor.  The question is this, do you really want the flavor of bacon lingering in your mouth after brushing your teeth?  If the answer is yes, then you&#x27;ll enjoy this toothpaste.  After trying the toothpaste, my son said no on the lingering after taste, and gave it back to me!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my granddaughter who is a bacon fan, thought it tasted awful. I cant recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very fast service! Thanks!  Have no idea how it tastes, but it&#x27;s a gag gift, so that didn&#x27;t matter so much:)</li>
            <li> Well, it really taste like bacon, bacon pudding that is. Not a good idea to brush your teeth with(common sense). Good for decoration...</li>
            <li> This made a great gag gift.  We used it for a White Elephant and people kept stealing it.  Great idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure after this, it&#x27;s all downhill from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless they make bacon-flavored fillings. I&#x27;d get cavities on purpose.</li>
            <li> White elephant gift that my 14 yr old brother in law ended up with. I think he thought he could actually eat it or something lol it was pretty gross, but was the most fought over item in our family exchange!</li>
            <li> My son is a bacon fanatic so I bought this (and other Mr. Bacon products) as stocking stuffers.  We ended up throwing them all away.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but the taste was disgusting.</li>
            <li> Great gag gift for the bacon lover.</li>
            <li> This was a fun gag gift.  We used it for a bacon basket donated as a fundraiser.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gag-gift for my son but he actually likes it! Definately smells like bacon!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m not sure what this stuff tastes like but its definitely not bacon.More like some weird plastic.Don&#x60;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Gave this to DAD for X-mas because he lives for Bacon.</li>
            <li> Smells like bacon works like your average toothpaste. Hubby has used and enjoyed this. It was great for his bacon themed birthday.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this toothpaste. Also have tried pickle and cupcake. Love them. Flavor is so bold and nice.</li>
            <li> fun for Christmas stocking, but tastes aweful</li>
            <li> Every Christmas I get my guy a special bacon surprise, rather it is bacon soap or floss.. This TOP the list though, he likes it, but it is a bit too much for my liking.. Great product for manly men though lol</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my fiance, and gag gift indeed. The smell was terrible, and when we opened it a bit of what looked like  grease came out. But despite the smell we decided we had to try it out of principle. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. We both had to spit it right out for fear of throwing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since had friends try it, and all had the same reaction. It was a fun joke, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gag gift for my Dentist. I don&#x27;t intend to use the product</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old gets this in his stocking every christmas. He loves it! YUCK! Tastes like real Bacon though.</li>
            <li> Great gag gift. I have not and do not plan to try it.</li>
            <li> The concept is what makes the product stand out.  To be honest, I have yet to put any in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I took it to school and m class had a lot of different reactions</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for a bacon-obsessed friend and she absolutely loved the idea. The packaging design on the box and toothpaste tube are great (just like the picture) and I think it went over well as a good gag gift. The only complaint my friend and I have is that the toothpaste tastes nothing like bacon. If anything, it just takes like a weird mint flavor--perhaps mint that&#x27;s gone bad? I guess I would classify this item as gag gift worthy but don&#x27;t actually buy it to brush your teeth with.</li>
            <li> Funny? Sort of. Gross? Definitely. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend spending so much on a gag gift, but for my dentist husband who eats BACON all the time, it was pretty cute.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift last night for a white elephant.  Everyone thought it was so funny!!  It was definatly a hit at the party!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and it went over perfectly. Upon arrival, though, the box was in pretty sad shape and required lots of tape to get it restored but other than that, I was very happy.</li>
