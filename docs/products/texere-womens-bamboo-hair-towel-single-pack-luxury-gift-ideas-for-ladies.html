            <li>I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hair wrap.</li>
            <li>I miss cotton, but I&#x27;ve found bamboo is an AWESOME alternative.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my shoulder length medium weight hair and the loop is genius.</li>
            <li>This one is great!  </li>

            <li>I love the hair wrap!&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Hawkins</li>
            <li>The fabric is great and very absorbent.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love this towel.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you do not use fabric softener on it.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it is terry towel and Not micro fiber.  </li>
            <li>Much better than those synthetic versions.</li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase more for gifts.</li>
            <li>That is one of the things I like most about this hair wrap...</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews let me add some info here</li>
            <li>So much better than the &amp;#34;store&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love it and it makes my life easy.</li>
            <li>She has a lot of hair and it works fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and it longer than my hair which is great.  </li>
            <li>The fit for me is fine</li>
            <li>my hair is short and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Substantial and does a great job on my short hair.  </li>
            <li>it really works well and overall is a great product!  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, buy one of these, they are great to use and dry easily - my wife hangs hers on the doorknob</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it&#x27;s simple, comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>She is super psyched about it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice enough for a hair towel.</li>
            <li>I own several bamboo towels and a bamboo blanket, all of which have fantastic weight but have held up really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my old lady for her birthday, she loves it, this is a great get for any with long hair.</li>
            <li>(maybe that&#x27;s what bamboo is like), the part that fits over the head is huge (fine for someone with lots of hair, but not for me), and the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is too short to tuck the end in and have it stay.</li>
            <li>Its really lightweight, unlike some of the big towels I own..</li>
            <li>; - )</li>
            <li>Even when I put it on backwards the first time ;)  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li>With this wrap you  just pull the very tip of the towel through the loop and voila&#x27;</li>
            <li>Fiance loves it and it saves about fifteen minutes of her getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine if I were dying it anything darker or more vibrant than dark brown.  </li>
            <li>If the wrap were a little longer, it would be better for me.</li>
            <li>The bamboo is very absorbent and soft and the wrap is well made.</li>
            <li>I color my hair on occasion and it does bleed into my towels during the first several weeks of washing.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it really does a better job than a regular towel in removing the wetness from the hair.</li>
            <li>I have two little kids and cannot chase them around while balancing a huge towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No problems with it so far, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>I unexpectedly like this</li>
            <li>This feels so soft and luxurious and absorbs moisture well too.</li>
            <li>The elastic hook at the back that holds the towel in place works really well.  </li>
            <li>it is actually pretty dry when I am done.</li>
            <li>You can make sure to keep it on your head and loose in the body by just pulling it tight around the reinforced part and framing it to your face , twisting then pulling the twist up and through before securing it.</li>
            <li>I wish this were available in at least a tan as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I managed to live so long without one of these.  </li>
            <li>As she is getting ready, the wrap absorbs moisture out of her hair which cuts down on the drying time.  </li>
            <li>It helps cut the time in half when she is getting ready.</li>

            <li> It helps cut the time in half when she is getting ready.</li>
            <li> The material is thick and soft, but still dries relatively fast.</li>
            <li> I ran around the house in this for over an hour during which time my hair was dry enough to work with.  </li>
            <li> Does definitely make your hair dry quicker.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair takes a long time to dry, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something to help.  </li>
            <li> Love the little elastic to hold the twisted end.  </li>
            <li> It is loose enough for air circulation, and tight enough for stability.</li>
            <li> My hair takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> She says it helps her hair dry a lot faster while she is getting dressed,</li>
            <li> it does not have an elastic loop that will stretch or dry out or a button that will fall off (I&#x27;ve had wraps that have both and have had those issues).</li>
            <li> My wife likes this to dry her hair after the shower.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to be worn loose to allow hair to vent and keep it from tugging and breaking.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it could, by making the loop a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thinner than a big fluffy towel</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was looking for, but it is working well for me.  </li>
            <li> She likes it because of it&#x27;s small size compared to a regular towel.</li>
            <li> I have LONG and THICK hair and hate having to try to pile a full size bath towel on my head long enough for the hair to be dry at all.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is the tie down loop is too small</li>
            <li> Prefer this material to the other, fleece ones I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
            <li> I can leave my hair in the towel for half an hour and</li>
            <li> I think that the no elastic band is to keep you from pulling the towel too tight.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for little Christmas &amp;#34;tuck in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The material is thin enough to twist and wrap tight.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t leave it in the towel for at least 10 minutes, it will still be dripping down onto my shirt.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the loop is too small and it&#x27;s a chore trying to stick the end of the towel through the loop.  </li>
            <li> She did mention the closure / loop could be reworked, but overall she loves the item, and, at this pricepoint, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that some were complaining about the small tab.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get the towel end in the loop.</li>
            <li> A little thin but works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair wrap several times, and I&#x27;m afraid I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the women who didn&#x27;t like it had a lot of thick hair?</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult,  but other than that dhe likes it.</li>
            <li> I was so we hesitant to order since I was so disappointed in the one I bought from a major retailer.  </li>
            <li> No big ugly button!  </li>
            <li> So difficult to get away from microfiber these days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold to the touch</li>
            <li> I hate the stuff</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the hair wrap!&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Hawkins</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for little Christmas &amp;#34;tuck in&amp;#34; gifts.  The fabric is great and very absorbent.  The material is thin enough to twist and wrap tight.  The problem is that the loop is too small and it&#x27;s a chore trying to stick the end of the towel through the loop.  The towel is also too short to just tuck the towel in at your neck.  So, I like it but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it could, by making the loop a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Very good quality!  This product is well worth the price. My wife uses it everyday. Washes just fine and doesn&#x27;t collect fuzzy bunnies (lint) while in the dryer!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 as gifts for my daughters. No complaints. Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Absorbent and great size.  Love the little elastic to hold the twisted end.  No big ugly button!  ; - )</li>
            <li> Nice enough for a hair towel. A little thin but works okay. No problems with it so far, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was looking for, but it is working well for me.  I have LONG and THICK hair and hate having to try to pile a full size bath towel on my head long enough for the hair to be dry at all.  My hair takes forever to dry and if I don&#x27;t leave it in the towel for at least 10 minutes, it will still be dripping down onto my shirt.  I have two little kids and cannot chase them around while balancing a huge towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel lightweight, fits all my hair in it (and I have a lot of hair). and stays put while I get things done around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can leave my hair in the towel for half an hour and it is actually pretty dry when I am done.</li>
            <li> It helps cut the time in half when she is getting ready. It used to take her over an hour to do her hair, now it is just 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it&#x27;s simple, comfortable and easy to use. my hair is short and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I had never had one of these and always wanted one. I was reluctant that it might not stay in a stationary place/secure on your head, but it totally does! Easy instructions and works great!</li>
            <li> I love this towel.  It works great!  I’ve had these type towels before and they don’t stay on - this one does.</li>
            <li> This does not pull on my hair or give me split ends.  it really works well and overall is a great product!  Just make sure you do not use fabric softener on it.  Not needed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. My daughter has 2 and my wife mentioned that she would like one also. She likes the product, but wishes the loop that you&#x27;re supposed to pull the towel through was elastic. It makes it difficult,  but other than that dhe likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my old lady for her birthday, she loves it, this is a great get for any with long hair.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is terry towel and Not micro fiber.  The fit for me is fine I just tuck it in the back.</li>
            <li> gave it is a gift to my friend.  She has a lot of hair and it works fine</li>
            <li> Hey there Amazon world, this is a great wrap.  I purchased it as a gift for my wife for Christmas and she uses it all the time!  She loves it!  She says it helps her hair dry a lot faster while she is getting dressed, etc.  She is super psyched about it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, buy one of these, they are great to use and dry easily - my wife hangs hers on the doorknob and it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making me look good!  Now she thinks I am an amazing husband! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and it longer than my hair which is great.  I am very happy with it.  I will be ordering another one along with the wrap around towel for when I am on the road since my work requires me to travel.</li>
            <li> Great absorption, large to accommodate a lot of hair. Would give it a 5 star if the loop was just a tad larger. Much better than those synthetic versions.</li>
            <li> This was a gift I received.  I unexpectedly like this so much I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> This feels so soft and luxurious and absorbs moisture well too. Arrived promptly and as described. I&#x27;m thinking about getting another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair wrap several times, and I&#x27;m afraid I just don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s cold to the touch (maybe that&#x27;s what bamboo is like), the part that fits over the head is huge (fine for someone with lots of hair, but not for me), and the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is too short to tuck the end in and have it stay. I know you&#x27;re supposed to pull the end through a loop, but the loop is tiny. If the wrap were a little longer, it would be better for me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair wrap. I love it and will purchase more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great quality and size. Prefer this material to the other, fleece ones I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my daughter. She likes it because of it&#x27;s small size compared to a regular towel. Not sure if it really does a better job than a regular towel in removing the wetness from the hair.</li>
            <li> The proof as they say, is in the pudding.  I bought this for my wife and I see her &amp;#34;pudding&amp;#34; it on her head every day.  She did mention the closure / loop could be reworked, but overall she loves the item, and, at this pricepoint, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.  Get one for her immediately if not sooner.</li>
            <li> I noticed that some were complaining about the small tab. That is one of the things I like most about this hair wrap...it does not have an elastic loop that will stretch or dry out or a button that will fall off (I&#x27;ve had wraps that have both and have had those issues). With this wrap you  just pull the very tip of the towel through the loop and voila&#x27; it holds nicely! It is loose enough for air circulation, and tight enough for stability. The bamboo is very absorbent and soft and the wrap is well made. GET IT NOW!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. The only issue is the tie down loop is too small and it is hard to get the towel end in the loop.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this to dry her hair after the shower. It&#x27;s smaller to keep around then a towel and drys faster because it&#x27;s smaller. It fits around her head very easy.</li>
            <li> The elastic hook at the back that holds the towel in place works really well.  The material is thick and soft, but still dries relatively fast.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I managed to live so long without one of these.  After reading many reviews let me add some info here: There is now an elastic band to hold the towel end.  Yes, it&#x27;s thinner than a big fluffy towel but it stops your hair from dripping all over when you get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, comes with handy instructions for those of us who actually need them, and it works great! This arrived yesterday and I used it last evening when I showered.  I ran around the house in this for over an hour during which time my hair was dry enough to work with.  And I will be using only one towel after showering now instead of two.  I love it!</li>
            <li> So difficult to get away from microfiber these days. Its not absorbent, but clings to and creates lint, clings to odor.. and bacteria. I hate the stuff and I think it feels gross. I miss cotton, but I&#x27;ve found bamboo is an AWESOME alternative. When I cant find cotton, I don&#x27;t hesitate at all to go to bamboo. I own several bamboo towels and a bamboo blanket, all of which have fantastic weight but have held up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges of this towel wrap are reinforced with a lining to keep it from unraveling. I thought that was nice. I think that the no elastic band is to keep you from pulling the towel too tight. Its suppose to be worn loose to allow hair to vent and keep it from tugging and breaking. You can make sure to keep it on your head and loose in the body by just pulling it tight around the reinforced part and framing it to your face , twisting then pulling the twist up and through before securing it. Its really lightweight, unlike some of the big towels I own.. which were actually straining my neck and pulling on my hair as they started to tilt off my head from weight as I tried to do things about the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing.. I wish this were available in at least a tan as well. I color my hair on occasion and it does bleed into my towels during the first several weeks of washing. Tan I can get away with using.. white, forget it. I can&#x27;t imagine if I were dying it anything darker or more vibrant than dark brown.  All in all though.. I love it and it makes my life easy.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my shoulder length medium weight hair and the loop is genius. Even when I put it on backwards the first time ;)  I use it after my shower and for masks.  I wonder if the women who didn&#x27;t like it had a lot of thick hair?</li>
            <li> Does definitely make your hair dry quicker.  Great wicking properties.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair takes a long time to dry, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something to help.  She LOVES this product.  Once out of the shower, she towel dries her hair, then puts her hair in this thingy.  As she is getting ready, the wrap absorbs moisture out of her hair which cuts down on the drying time.  Also, it holds her hair out of the way while she is putting on makeup.  Win-win.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice fabric .. But no anchoring button in back, so it has a tendency to slide off my head.</li>
            <li> So much better than the &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; brand!  I was so we hesitant to order since I was so disappointed in the one I bought from a major retailer.  This one is great!  Substantial and does a great job on my short hair.  Would not hesitate to give to friends as a gift.</li>
            <li> A GREAT product.  Fiance loves it and it saves about fifteen minutes of her getting ready in the morning.  A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife as a gift and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Bought this for a gift grab bag and it seemed to be well received by the person who got it.&amp;#34;</li>
