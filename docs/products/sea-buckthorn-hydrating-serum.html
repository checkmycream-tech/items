            <li>It glides on and feels great, my skin drinks up the serum</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be really good for Rosacea, but that was not my experience</li>
            <li>plural) looking for a moisturizer that did not leave my skin oily within a couple of hours, didn&#x27;t clog pores and make me break-out, and had good ingredients.</li>
            <li>This serum is truly perfect for day time use because it is so light.</li>
            <li>I wear it day and night under the moisturizing cream and my skin looks great, feels soft and best of all I don&#x27;t break out!</li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with all of the Sibu products I have bought, and will continue to order from this line!</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, just like the title says.</li>
            <li>I liked that it mentioned that the Sibu serum was loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>It does not have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soo thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any really nice qualities to it (smell, texture, feel on skin), and hasn&#x27;t seemed to do anything with regards to the texture of my skin, wrinkles, acne, or anything.</li>
            <li>NIce packaging.</li>
            <li>This serum spreads nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried the sample from a store and liked the lightness of the product.</li>
            <li>Feels nice since it is lightweight and has a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>I love the light citrus-y smell and the beautiful feel of this serum.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s really making a substantive difference, but it sure feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good for my rosacea skin!</li>
            <li>It is a good brand, but Sea Buckthorne is Sea Buckthorne and that is what you want, I think getting a bottle of regular sea buckthorne is the most beneficial way to buy this wonderful and amazing oil.</li>
            <li>Received the package super fast and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I was better off without.</li>
            <li>My looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>, price was much better than ad suggesting it $40.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love this serum</li>
            <li>I see this as a must have in any skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li>After using the products, I am amazed how my skin has gotten so much better.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier and am so glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li>its ok, i didnt like the greasy feeling</li>
            <li>I hesitated to buy this product, but was insistent on changing most of my beauty regimen over to products that included sea buckthorn oil in it...</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the oil much more - this is like applying water to my face-</li>
            <li>This serum seems to have put me over the top</li>
            <li>B00775DNMI Healthy Origins Astaxanthin Triple Strength]]</li>
            <li>Healthy, organic, hydrant for face.</li>
            <li>One of the better serums for face.</li>
            <li>I love the way it moisturizes my face and the way it feels.</li>
            <li>A product I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>here on Amazon it is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I love this serum and use it in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li>I never want to wear this during the day under makeup as it will cause my combination/oily skin to become even more oily/shiny.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>dollars a bottle you&#x27;ll have to buy more bottles to keep using it.</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>Have been applying it to my face, and it doesn&#x27;t feel fresh nor does it have a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, not overpowering like the other chemical laden products.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying using good natural products for my skin care routine</li>
            <li>All the products are wonderful and the price and service thru Amazon are amazing as usual!</li>
            <li>All most of them managed to do was break me out, or sweet and ozze of my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>It felt fine on my face...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge skeptic of beauty products, but this one lives up to what others say.  </li>
            <li>oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;BEST ORGANIC WHEATGRASS- (makes a huge difference for complexion)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>3- (another huge boost)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001N0LPPA B001N0LPPA]]&lt;br /&gt;ASTAXANTHIN&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>the products are light and not greasy...</li>
            <li>My face has gotten so smooth and clearer.</li>
            <li>I can use it freely throughtout my face and around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using since I received, a week ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Everything is well thought out, and this leaves my skin looking healthy with just the right amount of glow and a ton of hydration.</li>
            <li>I originally started looking into Murad.</li>
            <li>and it leaves a rich glow and seems to be clearing my skin as well as reducing lines also.</li>
            <li>After the lady at the health food store told me about seabuckthorn and all of its benefits I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I do not feel like this serum really does much even though the ingredient Sea Buckthorn is supposed to be really good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>So far i am very happy with this product and hope to keep using it as part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li>With amazing reviews, i was expecting something good but after a few weeks of using it, I don&#x27;t see what is special about it.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find something that I&#x27;d be able to use consistently without any issues as I was growing used to the idea that my skin was just a real pain in the @ss.</li>
            <li>very hydrating, the best one I&#x27;ve tried, good for middle aged skin.</li>
            <li>I would love to find a natural cruelty free product that works as well as Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair.  </li>
            <li>I am now trying to use more natural products that are cruelty free and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok I am not really seeing anything amazing yet.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling non-greasy, non-shiny.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s so very hydrating!!</li>
            <li>so I decided to search Amazon and found the same one at a better price!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant enough, but I most likely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Wonderful serum, sinks in skin in a moment and allows the cream above it to absorb well.</li>
            <li>that I feel it&#x27;s worth my while to write a review.</li>
            <li>I use it daily under my moisturizer as this is not that moisturizing on its own.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for three weeks, I don&#x27;t feel that the product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far it seems ok.</li>
            <li>Right now, I do not feel this product is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>they soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li>The serum sunk right into my skin.</li>
            <li>however it does turn a bit tacky and sticky if you keep rubbing it in, but i find that the stickiness goes away rather quickly so it doesnt bother me much.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about out of my first bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty sticky and you can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased this, so I am assuming this is what the texture/consistency is all the time.  </li>
            <li>It probably is not moisturizing enough for many people.  </li>
            <li>My first time buying the Sea Buckthorn Hydrating Serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous serums that are either &#x27;oily&#x27; or &#x27;sticky&#x27;...this one just absorbs completely into the skin with no residue and gives it a soft glowy feel that you will notice immediately and then more and more with time...</li>
            <li>This by far the greatest mosturizet I have ever used in the winter time due my very dry skin, coconut oil did NOT do even half as good job as this serum.</li>
            <li>It is not terribly hydrating, in fact it seems drying and the companion daytime facial moisturizer  doesn&#x27;t alleviate the dryness very well.</li>
            <li>I love this serum and really feel that I can see a difference in my skin texture after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>And for the past 4 months I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, I am a huge fan of SIBU and tried this product for the first time about 2 months ago, and now I&#x27;m on my third jar!</li>
            <li>I really like this hydrating serum.  </li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t as hydrating for me.</li>
            <li>This serum really feels like my skin \\&quot;drinks\\&quot;</li>
            <li>- I use (and this regimen is really working for me-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks o</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and definitely works as a hydrating choice.</li>
            <li>It is a light weight product, but does not provide enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>Results are my skin is very hydrated.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Sibu because of their sustainable practices, where they source the berry from, how they support Himalayan families, but I&#x27;m especially a fan because I think that this product line is responsible for clearing my skin and restoring its natural balance...!!!</li>
            <li>I think Sea Buckthorn products really work, particularly the berry and stem oil capsules.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, not greasy, very light to no scent.</li>
            <li>And as far as serums are concerned this is one is not expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having less breakouts, my skin is more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;, and it isn&#x27;t oily or try.  </li>
            <li>But it is highly oily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li>I still have my normal breakouts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li>This serum seems to have a thin consistency....which I guess is good for me since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I live in the high desert...hot and windy.</li>
            <li>I wanted something more natural and less chemical based</li>
            <li>Feel like it adds just the right amount of moisture to my facial regimen</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that this product has helped to reduce my oil, but it goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel extremely hydrated without tightness.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Sibu Sea Buckthorn Serum and update my review if there are new developments/changes in my complexion.</li>
            <li>my teenaged children keep asking what I am doing or if I have a new makeup.</li>
            <li>(I have to admit, I am very sensitive to smell).</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products in the past fifty years trying to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li>you have any of the issues that I do with my complexion, and you are smart enough to know that you need moisturizer no matter your skin type, then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums over the last few years and am not at all impressed by this one.</li>
            <li>Previously, I have used Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair, which I like</li>
            <li>not sure if it would be effective on those who need extra hydration.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I only like to buy products that are natural and free of chemical that maybe harmful in the long run.</li>
            <li>This serum does not dry out my skin, it actually make it feel softer and firmer after putting it on right away</li>
            <li>My mom advised me to start taking care of my skin young.</li>
            <li>Havn&#x27;t noticed a difference so far and have been using if for about a month.</li>
            <li>, I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s all natural to.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early.</li>
            <li>but, then again I really doubt any product can roll back the hands of time on your skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>It make my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>I think its too early for any results.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitively differently markedly improved and FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>had a sense this might work as the Omega 7 is the Seabuckthorn is vital to your skin.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and no one believe my age.</li>
            <li>but it may be because it is a natural product....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since its natural and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs, and any serum is worth the extra price; with regular use.</li>
            <li>Many other products ,I have to be careful not to go near the eyes.</li>
            <li>I just re-ordered my second one, and ordered my first Sibu Facial Cream as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major plus for me that it is all natural</li>
            <li>so I thought I would try this hydrating cream although it is nearly double the amount of the cream I normally use.  </li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but as someone with extreme sensitivity to ingredients and not getting any sort of negative reaction with this, I imagine it is good for MANY/MOST skin issues.</li>
            <li>The serum feels slightly sticky, but again that disappears when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to my old stand-by</li>
            <li>The pimples are gone, the skin is soft and just glows, and this is after only one week of use.  </li>
            <li>I have only started using this product so it is early days yet.</li>
            <li>After finishing the whole bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice and positive OR negative difference.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product and received it with a very SHORT shelf life, less than 5 months to be exact.</li>
            <li>is this product old and paased its prime and has it been sitting in a warehouse for a long time?</li>
            <li>I even use it at night for those hot nights where I don&#x27;t want anything heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Estee Lauder and like this just as much and for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so that helps with saving product and the consistency is absolutely divine!  </li>

            <li> Its pretty good for my rosacea skin!</li>
            <li> It is a good brand, but Sea Buckthorne is Sea Buckthorne and that is what you want, I think getting a bottle of regular sea buckthorne is the most beneficial way to buy this wonderful and amazing oil.</li>
            <li> Received the package super fast and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I was better off without.</li>
            <li> My looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> , price was much better than ad suggesting it $40.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love this serum</li>
            <li> I see this as a must have in any skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li> After using the products, I am amazed how my skin has gotten so much better.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier and am so glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li> its ok, i didnt like the greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this product, but was insistent on changing most of my beauty regimen over to products that included sea buckthorn oil in it...</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the oil much more - this is like applying water to my face-</li>
            <li> This serum seems to have put me over the top</li>
            <li> B00775DNMI Healthy Origins Astaxanthin Triple Strength]]</li>
            <li> Healthy, organic, hydrant for face.</li>
            <li> One of the better serums for face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it moisturizes my face and the way it feels.</li>
            <li> A product I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> here on Amazon it is much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and use it in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> I never want to wear this during the day under makeup as it will cause my combination/oily skin to become even more oily/shiny.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> dollars a bottle you&#x27;ll have to buy more bottles to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with pretty good skin.</li>
            <li> Have been applying it to my face, and it doesn&#x27;t feel fresh nor does it have a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, not overpowering like the other chemical laden products.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using good natural products for my skin care routine</li>
            <li> All the products are wonderful and the price and service thru Amazon are amazing as usual!</li>
            <li> All most of them managed to do was break me out, or sweet and ozze of my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> It felt fine on my face...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge skeptic of beauty products, but this one lives up to what others say.  </li>
            <li> oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;BEST ORGANIC WHEATGRASS- (makes a huge difference for complexion)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>

            <li> the products are light and not greasy...</li>
            <li> My face has gotten so smooth and clearer.</li>
            <li> I can use it freely throughtout my face and around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using since I received, a week ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Everything is well thought out, and this leaves my skin looking healthy with just the right amount of glow and a ton of hydration.</li>
            <li> I originally started looking into Murad.</li>
            <li> and it leaves a rich glow and seems to be clearing my skin as well as reducing lines also.</li>
            <li> After the lady at the health food store told me about seabuckthorn and all of its benefits I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I do not feel like this serum really does much even though the ingredient Sea Buckthorn is supposed to be really good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> So far i am very happy with this product and hope to keep using it as part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li> With amazing reviews, i was expecting something good but after a few weeks of using it, I don&#x27;t see what is special about it.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find something that I&#x27;d be able to use consistently without any issues as I was growing used to the idea that my skin was just a real pain in the @ss.</li>
            <li> very hydrating, the best one I&#x27;ve tried, good for middle aged skin.</li>
            <li> I would love to find a natural cruelty free product that works as well as Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair.  </li>
            <li> I am now trying to use more natural products that are cruelty free and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok I am not really seeing anything amazing yet.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling non-greasy, non-shiny.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s so very hydrating!!</li>
            <li> so I decided to search Amazon and found the same one at a better price!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant enough, but I most likely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum, sinks in skin in a moment and allows the cream above it to absorb well.</li>
            <li> that I feel it&#x27;s worth my while to write a review.</li>
            <li> I use it daily under my moisturizer as this is not that moisturizing on its own.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for three weeks, I don&#x27;t feel that the product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far it seems ok.</li>
            <li> Right now, I do not feel this product is really worth it.  </li>
            <li> they soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li> The serum sunk right into my skin.</li>
            <li> however it does turn a bit tacky and sticky if you keep rubbing it in, but i find that the stickiness goes away rather quickly so it doesnt bother me much.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about out of my first bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty sticky and you can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this, so I am assuming this is what the texture/consistency is all the time.  </li>
            <li> It probably is not moisturizing enough for many people.  </li>
            <li> My first time buying the Sea Buckthorn Hydrating Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous serums that are either &#x27;oily&#x27; or &#x27;sticky&#x27;...this one just absorbs completely into the skin with no residue and gives it a soft glowy feel that you will notice immediately and then more and more with time...</li>
            <li> This by far the greatest mosturizet I have ever used in the winter time due my very dry skin, coconut oil did NOT do even half as good job as this serum.</li>
            <li> It is not terribly hydrating, in fact it seems drying and the companion daytime facial moisturizer  doesn&#x27;t alleviate the dryness very well.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and really feel that I can see a difference in my skin texture after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> And for the past 4 months I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, I am a huge fan of SIBU and tried this product for the first time about 2 months ago, and now I&#x27;m on my third jar!</li>
            <li> I really like this hydrating serum.  </li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t as hydrating for me.</li>
            <li> This serum really feels like my skin \\&quot;drinks\\&quot;</li>
            <li> - I use (and this regimen is really working for me-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks o</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and definitely works as a hydrating choice.</li>
            <li> It is a light weight product, but does not provide enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> Results are my skin is very hydrated.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Sibu because of their sustainable practices, where they source the berry from, how they support Himalayan families, but I&#x27;m especially a fan because I think that this product line is responsible for clearing my skin and restoring its natural balance...!!!</li>
            <li> I think Sea Buckthorn products really work, particularly the berry and stem oil capsules.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy, very light to no scent.</li>
            <li> And as far as serums are concerned this is one is not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having less breakouts, my skin is more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;, and it isn&#x27;t oily or try.  </li>
            <li> But it is highly oily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li> I still have my normal breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li> This serum seems to have a thin consistency....which I guess is good for me since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I live in the high desert...hot and windy.</li>
            <li> I wanted something more natural and less chemical based</li>
            <li> Feel like it adds just the right amount of moisture to my facial regimen</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that this product has helped to reduce my oil, but it goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel extremely hydrated without tightness.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use Sibu Sea Buckthorn Serum and update my review if there are new developments/changes in my complexion.</li>
            <li> my teenaged children keep asking what I am doing or if I have a new makeup.</li>
            <li> (I have to admit, I am very sensitive to smell).</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past fifty years trying to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> you have any of the issues that I do with my complexion, and you are smart enough to know that you need moisturizer no matter your skin type, then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums over the last few years and am not at all impressed by this one.</li>
            <li> Previously, I have used Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair, which I like</li>
            <li> not sure if it would be effective on those who need extra hydration.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I only like to buy products that are natural and free of chemical that maybe harmful in the long run.</li>
            <li> This serum does not dry out my skin, it actually make it feel softer and firmer after putting it on right away</li>
            <li> My mom advised me to start taking care of my skin young.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t noticed a difference so far and have been using if for about a month.</li>
            <li> , I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s all natural to.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early.</li>
            <li> but, then again I really doubt any product can roll back the hands of time on your skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> It make my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I think its too early for any results.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitively differently markedly improved and FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> had a sense this might work as the Omega 7 is the Seabuckthorn is vital to your skin.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and no one believe my age.</li>
            <li> but it may be because it is a natural product....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since its natural and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs, and any serum is worth the extra price; with regular use.</li>
            <li> Many other products ,I have to be careful not to go near the eyes.</li>
            <li> I just re-ordered my second one, and ordered my first Sibu Facial Cream as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major plus for me that it is all natural</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try this hydrating cream although it is nearly double the amount of the cream I normally use.  </li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but as someone with extreme sensitivity to ingredients and not getting any sort of negative reaction with this, I imagine it is good for MANY/MOST skin issues.</li>
            <li> The serum feels slightly sticky, but again that disappears when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to my old stand-by</li>
            <li> The pimples are gone, the skin is soft and just glows, and this is after only one week of use.  </li>
            <li> I have only started using this product so it is early days yet.</li>
            <li> After finishing the whole bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice and positive OR negative difference.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and received it with a very SHORT shelf life, less than 5 months to be exact.</li>
            <li> is this product old and paased its prime and has it been sitting in a warehouse for a long time?</li>
            <li> I even use it at night for those hot nights where I don&#x27;t want anything heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder and like this just as much and for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so that helps with saving product and the consistency is absolutely divine!  </li>
            <li> (The price at the store was a little high</li>
            <li> The amount given is rather small and even using only two pumps a night is a bit much, in terms of price versus amount</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin, plush face &amp; bad rosacea.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it goes by quite fast.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m going back to product that is less expensive and smells better.</li>
            <li> And it took me a long time to get used to this funky smell</li>
            <li> Whether I&#x27;m actually seeing any difference, not really.</li>
            <li> is a big question mark especially since they give you such a small bottle which means even for $20</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin</li>
            <li> So I was hesitant to try it since I&#x27;ve tried the Lancôme genefique serum and that would dry out my skin and make me break out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have dry skin.</li>
            <li> So I usually never right a review, if I like a product I simply leave it as that.</li>
            <li> , it kinda smells like black licorice, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> I think at full price, it is expensive but</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times each time after I got my skin to settle down and retried it.  </li>
            <li> Not really acne prone.</li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS</li>
            <li> My skin has a rough texture from acne scars and the texture has somewhat gotten smoother with continued use of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other facial serums that I have been content with, but I will not add this one on to that list.</li>
            <li> Most other people would be disappointed by the thin consistency of this serum because it does not feel very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it has created a new radiance in my skin that I was unable to achieve prior.</li>
            <li> but the little dark spots that I had noticed on my face before actually have started to disappear a lot, plus I love how affordable it is compared to some serums that are just horrible for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review for products unless I am blown away and Sibu products have definitely blown me away</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> Will stick to my other brands.</li>
            <li> When I think of serums, I think of very heavy and thick liquid to help your skin with hydration, toning, and possibly even looking younger.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried to pump less, but even slowly applying pressure still gave me the regular one pump quantity.</li>
            <li> Being older but still having problems with skin blemishes is difficult.  </li>
            <li> It was a little sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> perhaps I&#x27;m not familiar with the word serum</li>
            <li> This serum, however,  is not a very elegant formulation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 20 in a few days...</li>
            <li> &quot; everyday.</li>
            <li> A few people have asked me what I&#x27;ve been using on my face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want something to heavy because I have skin on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> and I usually stick to the products that I&#x27;m use to</li>
            <li> I got recently, although an expensive treatment for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have found very few items that I can use on my face that does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> But again, this is probably due to its thin watery consistency.  </li>
            <li> The pump is also hard to control.</li>
            <li> , Oil of Olay - at least it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have honey on my face.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have normal/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At least, not when it comes to skin rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> It also turned out to be the only thing that soothed a bad case of poison ivy</li>
            <li> This actually smelled bad and made my face break out.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible, although the odor seems to dissipate once it it absorbed  into the skin.</li>
            <li> For me, it was not a good product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a worry about unnecessary cruelty to animals in making the product.</li>
            <li> it did not feel uncomfortable, sticky, greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was turned OFF.</li>
            <li> Really not impressed-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This serum is a game changer for me!</li>
            <li> As soon as I found out about the sea buckthorn berry I went crazy and got the supplement, day lotion, hydrating serum and night cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of this product being greasy and sitting on your skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just unpleasant at that moment.</li>
            <li> Works bad for me but maybe cause I&#x27;m eleven.</li>
            <li> The serum itself isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert...hot and windy. The eleventh commandment here is moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! I have used many products in the past fifty years trying to keep my skin moist. The Sibu family of sea buckthorn seed oil, cream and serum are the best products I have found to do this...my face is still moist in the evening, therefore fewer wrinkles. Except for the oil, which you must use sparingly (I use it at night) the products are light and not greasy...they soak right into the skin. I really do love this stuff!</li>
            <li> very hydrating, the best one I&#x27;ve tried, good for middle aged skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Absorbs quickly, not greasy, very light to no scent. I wear it day and night under the moisturizing cream and my skin looks great, feels soft and best of all I don&#x27;t break out!</li>
            <li> My mom advised me to start taking care of my skin young. Along with diet, exercise... Moisturizing is key.  I&#x27;m turning 20 in a few days... And for the past 4 months I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer. I have been blessed with pretty good skin. Not really acne prone. But it is highly oily. I gave Aveeno, Olay, and Neutrogena a try. No luck. All most of them managed to do was break me out, or sweet and ozze of my face. I was better off without. I read an article on the sea buckthorn berry, and the Sibu serum on Shape magazine. I originally started looking into Murad. But it was a bit out of my budget. I liked that it mentioned that the Sibu serum was loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants. Which was what I was looking for. This stuff is AMAZING! the word HYDRATING doesn&#x27;t do it any justice. A pea size drop is all you need, and your skin just drinks it up! It&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t melt. And I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s helped control my oily-ness all together. My skin is \\&quot;bride-radiant\\&quot; everyday. I&#x27;m about out of my first bottle. I just re-ordered my second one, and ordered my first Sibu Facial Cream as well. I use the serum twice a day, morning and night along with (Olay Skin Smoothing Cream Scrub). My looks better than ever. I plan to continue using the Hydrating Serum at night and the Facial Cream in the morning! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum, sinks in skin in a moment and allows the cream above it to absorb well. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so not sure if it would be effective on those who need extra hydration.</li>
            <li> saw the product in INstyle and decided to try it.  Works great, price was much better than ad suggesting it $40.</li>
            <li> I think Sea Buckthorn products really work, particularly the berry and stem oil capsules. This serum, however,  is not a very elegant formulation. It smells horrible, although the odor seems to dissipate once it it absorbed  into the skin. It is not terribly hydrating, in fact it seems drying and the companion daytime facial moisturizer  doesn&#x27;t alleviate the dryness very well. I don&#x27;t have dry skin so it seems the product itself is causing that effect.  The serum feels slightly sticky, but again that disappears when it is absorbed. I&#x27;m using it because it&#x27;s Sea Buck-  thorn but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy more. I like the capsules and will continue using those.</li>
            <li> I have used the serum 3 weeks. It isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way. Would I buy it again ? Yes. Would I be lost without it? No.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I have found very few items that I can use on my face that does not irritate my eyes. I plan on buying this product again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good for my rosacea skin!</li>
            <li> This by far the greatest mosturizet I have ever used in the winter time due my very dry skin, coconut oil did NOT do even half as good job as this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge skeptic of beauty products, but this one lives up to what others say.  Makes my 54-year-old skin look smoother and has a great feel.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t noticed a difference so far and have been using if for about a month. It does not have a nice smell.The jury is still out on this product.</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff! Smooths face and takes redness away. Good for dry skin, plush face &amp; bad rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Sibu because of their sustainable practices, where they source the berry from, how they support Himalayan families, but I&#x27;m especially a fan because I think that this product line is responsible for clearing my skin and restoring its natural balance...!!! I&#x27;m having less breakouts, my skin is more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;, and it isn&#x27;t oily or try.  Just balanced.  I use this serum in the evening and sometimes in the mornings.  In the evenings I also use Sibu night cream.  It&#x27;s a miracle product and I&#x27;m amazed by the price for the value!  I also have the Sibu juice that I drink a shot of once daily for an internal boost.  I highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li> recommended by a relative, so i knew she had tried it! All the products are wonderful and the price and service thru Amazon are amazing as usual!</li>
            <li> So I usually never right a review, if I like a product I simply leave it as that. But I absolutely love this serum, I have really sensitive skin and I usually stick to the products that I&#x27;m use to so I won&#x27;t break out. So I was hesitant to try it since I&#x27;ve tried the Lancôme genefique serum and that would dry out my skin and make me break out. This serum does not dry out my skin, it actually make it feel softer and firmer after putting it on right away and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days but the little dark spots that I had noticed on my face before actually have started to disappear a lot, plus I love how affordable it is compared to some serums that are just horrible for sensitive skin plus it&#x27;s all natural to. The only con I can say about this serum is I don&#x27;t like the smell, it kinda smells like black licorice, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all but it&#x27;s just unpleasant at that moment. Anyway I&#x27;ve started to get my mother to use it as well and she loves this product, it&#x27;s also making me consider getting the eye cream too, I&#x27;m only twentyone but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early. I see this as a must have in any skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty sticky and you can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it on your skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a vast improvement - but, then again I really doubt any product can roll back the hands of time on your skin.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to my old stand-by, Oil of Olay - at least it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have honey on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product.  No greasy feeling at all.  Instant results.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now. This stuff is amazing! My face has gotten so smooth and clearer. A few people have asked me what I&#x27;ve been using on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is ok I am not really seeing anything amazing yet. It is a good brand, but Sea Buckthorne is Sea Buckthorne and that is what you want, I think getting a bottle of regular sea buckthorne is the most beneficial way to buy this wonderful and amazing oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review for products unless I am blown away and Sibu products have definitely blown me away that I feel it&#x27;s worth my while to write a review. I have been using this for a week now. As soon as I found out about the sea buckthorn berry I went crazy and got the supplement, day lotion, hydrating serum and night cream. I look forward to putting the product on every morning and night. it feels great on my skin and when I wake up in the morning, I see a noticeable difference. My skin has always been oily and my face would break out. My face always felt bumpy with pimples that would just not go away. After using the products, I am amazed how my skin has gotten so much better. The pimples are gone, the skin is soft and just glows, and this is after only one week of use.  I could not be happier and am so glad I decided to try it. It smells wonderful, not overpowering like the other chemical laden products. It&#x27;s a major plus for me that it is all natural and I don&#x27;t have a worry about unnecessary cruelty to animals in making the product. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I really like this hydrating serum.  I apply it before my daily cream.  Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> The reviews sold me on this but it really wasn&#x27;t as hydrating for me. I don&#x27;t even have dry skin. I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use oils.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  I have used Estee Lauder and like this just as much and for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! Been using it for two weeks and what a difference in wrinkles and bags under eyes!! I look 10 years younger! No skin break outs and it is non oily. I LOVE IT!!! Will be buying the night moisturizer next!!!</li>
            <li> its ok, i didnt like the greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this product, but was insistent on changing most of my beauty regimen over to products that included sea buckthorn oil in it...so I bought it.  A little goes a long way, so that helps with saving product and the consistency is absolutely divine!  I&#x27;ve tried numerous serums that are either &#x27;oily&#x27; or &#x27;sticky&#x27;...this one just absorbs completely into the skin with no residue and gives it a soft glowy feel that you will notice immediately and then more and more with time...I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with all of the Sibu products I have bought, and will continue to order from this line!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, just like the title says. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling non-greasy, non-shiny. I&#x27;ve used another brand of \\&quot;antioxidant\\&quot; serum before and it just made me feel like I was putting juice on my face. It was a little sticky afterwards. Needless to say, I was turned OFF. However, I am a huge fan of SIBU and tried this product for the first time about 2 months ago, and now I&#x27;m on my third jar! I L.O.V.E. it and use it day and night. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling as well, and the cap prevents it from bursting. Everything is well thought out, and this leaves my skin looking healthy with just the right amount of glow and a ton of hydration.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have normal/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this while I was trying out different serums and moisturizers from natural/ organic brands. After finishing the whole bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice and positive OR negative difference. I still have my normal breakouts like I do once a month. And it took me a long time to get used to this funky smell (I have to admit, I am very sensitive to smell). As a result, I&#x27;m going back to product that is less expensive and smells better.</li>
            <li> I love the light citrus-y smell and the beautiful feel of this serum.  It also turned out to be the only thing that soothed a bad case of poison ivy I got recently, although an expensive treatment for that purpose.  I use it daily under my moisturizer as this is not that moisturizing on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this about a week. So far I like it. It make my face feel soft. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.  I have no idea if it&#x27;s really making a substantive difference, but it sure feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been using since I received, a week ago and so far so good. I think its too early for any results. I do like how it makes my skin feel and the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> I like this serum.  My skin looks softer and clearer.  Being older but still having problems with skin blemishes is difficult.  Some products are too oily and some too drying.  This serum finds the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Truly Organic.</li>
            <li> Really not impressed- I prefer the oil much more - this is like applying water to my face- don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> At least, not when it comes to skin rejuvenation. It&#x27;s pleasant enough, but I most likely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product day and night before my moisturizer and all I can say is that I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! It is the ultimate hydrating skin perfecter!</li>
            <li> Received the package super fast and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much- it has created a new radiance in my skin that I was unable to achieve prior. This serum really feels like my skin \\&quot;drinks\\&quot; it up- and it leaves a rich glow and seems to be clearing my skin as well as reducing lines also. My skin is definitively differently markedly improved and FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I had a sense this might work as the Omega 7 is the Seabuckthorn is vital to your skin. This serum seems to have put me over the top and I would only go with this company&#x27;s products also for Seabuckthorn. I have tried others and they just are not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONALLY - I use (and this regimen is really working for me-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEABUCKTHORN OMEGA 7 OIL&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002SKISOA B002SKISOA]]&lt;br /&gt;/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;BEST ORGANIC WHEATGRASS- (makes a huge difference for complexion)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005FIN1LW B005FIN1LW]]&lt;br /&gt;COLLAGEN 1 AND 3- (another huge boost)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001N0LPPA B001N0LPPA]]&lt;br /&gt;ASTAXANTHIN&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00775DNMI Healthy Origins Astaxanthin Triple Strength]]</li>
            <li> I have used Sea Buckthorn before under another product.I loved it but I always wanted a serum. I like that I can use it freely throughtout my face and around the eyes. Many other products ,I have to be careful not to go near the eyes. The eyes will hurt throughthout the day. Therefore, I only like to buy products that are natural and free of chemical that maybe harmful in the long run. I am 63 years old and no one believe my age. People see no lines in the area around the eyes, mouth and forehead or the rest of the face. I have to prove my agewhen I want to use senior citizen discounts.</li>
            <li> This serum seems to have a thin consistency....which I guess is good for me since I have oily skin.  Most other people would be disappointed by the thin consistency of this serum because it does not feel very moisturizing.  I do not feel like this serum really does much even though the ingredient Sea Buckthorn is supposed to be really good for your skin.  This is the first time I have purchased this, so I am assuming this is what the texture/consistency is all the time.  The expiration on my bottle is 8/13 and I purchased this 4/13. It seems like it has a short shelf life but it may be because it is a natural product....-or is this product old and paased its prime and has it been sitting in a warehouse for a long time? It is fragrance-free.  It felt fine on my face...it did not feel uncomfortable, sticky, greasy or thick.  The serum sunk right into my skin. But again, this is probably due to its thin watery consistency.  It probably is not moisturizing enough for many people.  But I didn&#x27;t want something to heavy because I have skin on the oily side.  Previously, I have used Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair, which I like and  it benefitted my skin.  I am now trying to use more natural products that are cruelty free and environmentally friendly.  I would love to find a natural cruelty free product that works as well as Estee Lauders Advanced Night Repair.  Right now, I do not feel this product is really worth it.  And as far as serums are concerned this is one is not expensive.  It just does not seem or feel as if it is doing anything for my skin.  But it might be too soon to tell.  I will continue to use Sibu Sea Buckthorn Serum and update my review if there are new developments/changes in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and I can&#x27;t say that this product has helped to reduce my oil, but it goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel extremely hydrated without tightness.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a month. Its the last thing after my readiness-reducing lotion in th morning and antiwrinkle at night.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since its natural and inexpensive.  Well it&#x27;s so very hydrating!! I&#x27;m soo thrilled with the results.  Yeh I&#x27;m going to be 50 in 2 months and get compliments on my skin!  I&#x27;ve got the dewy texture back thanks o Sea Bukthorn Hydrating Serum!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums over the last few years and am not at all impressed by this one. It doesn&#x27;t have any really nice qualities to it (smell, texture, feel on skin), and hasn&#x27;t seemed to do anything with regards to the texture of my skin, wrinkles, acne, or anything. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> After the lady at the health food store told me about seabuckthorn and all of its benefits I was excited to try it out. (The price at the store was a little high so I decided to search Amazon and found the same one at a better price!) I love this serum and really feel that I can see a difference in my skin texture after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and absorbs quickly! NIce packaging. Healthy, organic, hydrant for face. One of the better serums for face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it moisturizes my face and the way it feels. It is silky smooth and definitely works as a hydrating choice.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for sensitive skin.  Acne prone skin can use this serum for moisturizing at night without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This actually smelled bad and made my face break out.  For me, it was not a good product.  I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t recommend it.  I bought this for my Rosacea which had been acting up anyway.  I tried this product several times each time after I got my skin to settle down and retried it.  Each time, it aggravated my skin.  It&#x27;s suppose to be really good for Rosacea, but that was not my experience so I am only giving it a 1 star.</li>
            <li> This serum spreads nicely. Seems to work well for me. A product I would buy again for sure. I wait until Sibu has my favorites on sale and then I buy them.</li>
            <li> This serum is a game changer for me! I have spent YEARS (yes, years... plural) looking for a moisturizer that did not leave my skin oily within a couple of hours, didn&#x27;t clog pores and make me break-out, and had good ingredients. This not only delivers on all of those wishes, it exceeded my expectations. I must admit, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find something that I&#x27;d be able to use consistently without any issues as I was growing used to the idea that my skin was just a real pain in the @ss. Just about EVERYTHING makes me break out. This doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin drinks it up, so it is left feeling plump, brighter and quenched.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin has a rough texture from acne scars and the texture has somewhat gotten smoother with continued use of this product&lt;br /&gt;* It does not leave a tacky feeling afterwards on the skin. It is smooth and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;* I only use 1-2 pumps for my entire face and neck and it lasted me about 2 months. I think at full price, it is expensive but here on Amazon it is much more affordable. DEFINITELY worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any of the issues that I do with my complexion, and you are smart enough to know that you need moisturizer no matter your skin type, then I highly recommend this product. I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but as someone with extreme sensitivity to ingredients and not getting any sort of negative reaction with this, I imagine it is good for MANY/MOST skin issues.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample from a store and liked the lightness of the product. After using it for three weeks, I don&#x27;t feel that the product is worth the money. It is a light weight product, but does not provide enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works bad for me but maybe cause I&#x27;m eleven. I have sensitive skin. It left me with big bumps and rashes.</li>
            <li> Great serum my teenaged children keep asking what I am doing or if I have a new makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I saw it on andreaschoice on youtube and I just had to have it...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of this product being greasy and sitting on your skin. It absorbs, and any serum is worth the extra price; with regular use.</li>
            <li> So far it seems ok. Feels nice since it is lightweight and has a pleasing scent. Feel like it adds just the right amount of moisture to my facial regimen</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and received it with a very SHORT shelf life, less than 5 months to be exact. Have been applying it to my face, and it doesn&#x27;t feel fresh nor does it have a nice fragrance. I&#x27;ve used a few other facial serums that I have been content with, but I will not add this one on to that list. Will stick to my other brands.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and use it in the morning and in the evening. It clears up blemishes and red spots. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great face oil recommended by Dr. Oz</li>
            <li> I have only started using this product so it is early days yet. I wanted something more natural and less chemical based and i feel this is the one for me. So far i am very happy with this product and hope to keep using it as part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell... no visible results.</li>
            <li> When I think of serums, I think of very heavy and thick liquid to help your skin with hydration, toning, and possibly even looking younger. I never want to wear this during the day under makeup as it will cause my combination/oily skin to become even more oily/shiny. This serum is truly perfect for day time use because it is so light. It absorbs immediately into the skin and has not made me look shiny at all. I even use it at night for those hot nights where I don&#x27;t want anything heavy on my skin. Results are my skin is very hydrated. I don&#x27;t notice any breakouts after using this product. My only complaint is that it goes by quite fast. I use one pump in the morning and one pump at night. After about 3 weeks, I have used 1/3 of the bottle already. The pump is also hard to control. I tried to pump less, but even slowly applying pressure still gave me the regular one pump quantity. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using good natural products for my skin care routine and I have been using the sibu repair and protect cream so I thought I would try this hydrating cream although it is nearly double the amount of the cream I normally use.  With amazing reviews, i was expecting something good but after a few weeks of using it, I don&#x27;t see what is special about it.  Its not hydrating at all.  perhaps I&#x27;m not familiar with the word serum but it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for my face.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks but I&#x27;m not very impressed.  Wish I would have purchased 2 of the repair and protect rather than this one.</li>
            <li> My first time buying the Sea Buckthorn Hydrating Serum and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. The amount given is rather small and even using only two pumps a night is a bit much, in terms of price versus amount it&#x27;s terrible. The serum itself isn&#x27;t bad at all. It glides on and feels great, my skin drinks up the serum however it does turn a bit tacky and sticky if you keep rubbing it in, but i find that the stickiness goes away rather quickly so it doesnt bother me much. Whether I&#x27;m actually seeing any difference, not really. Will I buy this serum again is a big question mark especially since they give you such a small bottle which means even for $20 something dollars a bottle you&#x27;ll have to buy more bottles to keep using it. So I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect night time moisturizer.</li>
