    <ol>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best stuff</li>
            <li>One of the best Eminence products for me.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, great skin care!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin exfoliated, yet incredibly supple.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that if you leave this masque on all night, you can peel it off in the morning and it leaves your face feeling Amazing!</li>
            <li>Eminence is probably the most affordable cosmetics on the market that produces great results!</li>
            <li>The best is the aroma - so nice that I would like to eat it rather than put it on my face:)</li>
            <li>For those who like a light grain type exfoliation, this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it~&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good~</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I can tell it has made my skin look amazing, glowing.  </li>
            <li>but then it stops, it&#x27;s good under the make up, and moisturize pretty good.</li>
            <li>My face feels very smooth after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it comes off typically in big strips), and wash remaining residue off and hello beautiful!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love the mask/scrub combination this has.</li>
            <li>I liked the sound of this product because it was an exfoliator</li>
            <li>The best part is that it didn&#x27;t take long for the results to show, which is why in just two months I&#x27;ve tried so many Eminence products -- because I love them</li>
            <li>This smells lovely, is easy to use and leaves my skin looking and feeling fabulous.</li>
            <li>used Eminence products several years ago and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This is a great brand of facial products all the way around.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products, they never fail to help my skin</li>
            <li>great, gentle exfoliator for really sensitive combination skin like mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin feeling very soft after and it has a nice smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is nothin special</li>
            <li>and it starts working right away!</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite way to apply the masque - I don&#x27;t dilute the product because I like it a little thicker (and it feels more potent too), go to bed, peels off in the morning</li>
            <li>this was one of the first Eminence products I bought and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the face masques and exfoliants and all of them made my skin look great.</li>
            <li>I use about once a week or so and find it worth investing in.</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my skin feel - and it is really nice because you hardly have to use any product to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>I saw that prices on Amazon were very reasonable compared to spas, figured I&#x27;d give it a</li>
            <li>sent the Hungarian masque back for a replacement, which seems to be okay.</li>
            <li>That way the products are guaranteed authentic and likely won&#x27;t be damaged.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3-4 weeks, and I feel I should have it longer before stating &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>skin is always sensitive, but feels comfortable by using</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great organic facial product..cleared my skin up pretty quickly and haven&#x27;t had any more trouble.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using Eminence products -- in addition to this masque and the Clear Skin line, I&#x27;ve tried the Hungarian and the Lime Refreshing tonique which I also love (I use the Hungarian masque every single night as was recommended, switching each night between the Clear Skin probiotic masque and the Rosehip/Maize masque where I use the Hungarian masque before the Clear Skin masque and on top of the Rosehip/Maize masque -- again, all recommended to me) -- and I&#x27;ve seen my skin go from problematic to pretty much entirely clear.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive experiences with this masque and all of the Eminence products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I use this in addition to other eminence products, i think it works best if you invest in a few products so they all work together.</li>
            <li>Mild, non-irritating formula that removes impurities and dead skin cells, and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t take anything too gritty or too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>I had used this product in the past purchased directly from a salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried about sleeping in a masque because my skin can be so sensitive, but I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off paying a few extra bucks to buy Eminence at a local reputable spa.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in your Eminence masque, yet - I highly suggest.</li>
            <li>and my skin is almost entirely clear!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product -  </li>
            <li>It was a first time purchase for me, but won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this masque along with the Clear Skin supplements, wash and moisturizer for two months now</li>
            <li>Seemed as if it were old.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone, sensitive, and oily skin and</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone looking for help with acne, redness, or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it was for oily skin and sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Eminence, for giving me back my clear skin!!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and most over the counter exfoliating products irritate my skin and make it worse.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, for the first few minutes it itches</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You emulsify with water, so it&#x27;s quite thick and goopy.</li>

            <li> I also ordered the Hungarian treatment masque, and its sealant was broken too with product seeping into the cap (that one, however, did contain the info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It stops the break-out from getting worse and begins the healing process.</li>

            <li> This is one of my go-to Eminence products. It leaves your skin exfoliated, yet incredibly supple.</li>
            <li> The vest skin care products. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, for the first few minutes it itches but then it stops, it&#x27;s good under the make up, and moisturize pretty good. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it anymore since first few minutes after use are pretty uncomfortable.</li>

I saw that prices on Amazon were very reasonable compared to spas, figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This masque arrived with a broken sealant and no product literature (piece of paper with Eminence info, comes with all legit products). All of the product appeared hardened/congealed into one side of the jar. I also ordered the Hungarian treatment masque, and its sealant was broken too with product seeping into the cap (that one, however, did contain the info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent the Hungarian masque back for a replacement, which seems to be okay. I am sending the Rosehip Masque back for a standard return because I don&#x27;t trust Amazon as a vendor for Eminence products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Stone Crop gel mask from a third party vendor here, and it had no sealant at all, and no literature either... returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off paying a few extra bucks to buy Eminence at a local reputable spa. That way the products are guaranteed authentic and likely won&#x27;t be damaged.</li>
            <li> Product received on time.  I had used this product in the past purchased directly from a salon and loved it.  However, this product was very thick, hard to spread even with a little water.  Seemed as if it were old.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products, they never fail to help my skin, it&#x27;s the best stuff no matter what you get!</li>
            <li> One of the best Eminence products for me. Mild, non-irritating formula that removes impurities and dead skin cells, and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much younger everytime I use it. Amazing product. ! This stuff took about ten years off of my face. .</li>
            <li> This is nothin special and I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> great, gentle exfoliator for really sensitive combination skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, sensitive, and oily skin and this was one of the first Eminence products I bought and my skin loves it! I only get facials now that use Eminence products. This masque can be used as an exfoliating cleanser (it contains ground Rosehip) or masque. I tend to use it as a masque whenever I find myself starting to have a break-out. It stops the break-out from getting worse and begins the healing process. Additionally, if I have any irritation/redness (especially after an extraction session) that starts to show I use the masque and it starts working right away! I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product -  I recommend it for anyone looking for help with acne, redness, or sensitive skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that if you leave this masque on all night, you can peel it off in the morning and it leaves your face feeling Amazing! I was a little worried about sleeping in a masque because my skin can be so sensitive, but I am so glad I did! This is now my favorite way to apply the masque - I don&#x27;t dilute the product because I like it a little thicker (and it feels more potent too), go to bed, peels off in the morning (it comes off typically in big strips), and wash remaining residue off and hello beautiful! If you haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in your Eminence masque, yet - I highly suggest.</li>
            <li> Eminence is probably the most affordable cosmetics on the market that produces great results! I have tried a few of the face masques and exfoliants and all of them made my skin look great. The best is the aroma - so nice that I would like to eat it rather than put it on my face:) All I can say is, great skin care!!!</li>
            <li> I recently discovered the Eminence products and I must confess... I&#x27;m in love! This is my favorite product I have tried. I love the mask/scrub combination this has. I promise you won&#x27;t have any regrets if you try this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the sound of this product because it was an exfoliator and it was for oily skin and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling very soft after and it has a nice smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. It was a first time purchase for me, but won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> For those who like a light grain type exfoliation, this is wonderful.  I leave on longer than the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3-4 weeks, and I feel I should have it longer before stating &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;  That being said, I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive experiences with this masque and all of the Eminence products I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve suffered from moderate hormonal acne all my life -- just enough to make me self-conscious and try everything known (from medication to naturopathic remedies) to get rid of it.  Nothing has worked until I went for a facial and was introduced to Eminence products (the place I go to only uses Eminence products for facials).  I&#x27;ve been using this masque along with the Clear Skin supplements, wash and moisturizer for two months now and my skin is almost entirely clear!!  I have only some leftover scarring from past acne, and even that has faded and continues to with my continued use of Eminence products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using Eminence products -- in addition to this masque and the Clear Skin line, I&#x27;ve tried the Hungarian and the Lime Refreshing tonique which I also love (I use the Hungarian masque every single night as was recommended, switching each night between the Clear Skin probiotic masque and the Rosehip/Maize masque where I use the Hungarian masque before the Clear Skin masque and on top of the Rosehip/Maize masque -- again, all recommended to me) -- and I&#x27;ve seen my skin go from problematic to pretty much entirely clear.  The best part is that it didn&#x27;t take long for the results to show, which is why in just two months I&#x27;ve tried so many Eminence products -- because I love them that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Eminence, for giving me back my clear skin!!</li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is always sensitive, but feels comfortable by using it~&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good~ I like it ~~~~</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my skin feel - and it is really nice because you hardly have to use any product to cover your face.  Just follow the instructions - emulsify with water - and it covers the entire face.  I can tell it has made my skin look amazing, glowing.  I use this in addition to other eminence products, i think it works best if you invest in a few products so they all work together.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again.  My skin is very sensitive, and most over the counter exfoliating products irritate my skin and make it worse.  This product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great brand of facial products all the way around. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great organic facial product..cleared my skin up pretty quickly and haven&#x27;t had any more trouble.</li>
