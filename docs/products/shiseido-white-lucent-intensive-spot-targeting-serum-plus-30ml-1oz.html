            <li> My dark spots and dull skin got much brighter.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks now and the skin is lighten up a little but the brown age spot on both side of my face didn&#x27;t make a different</li>

            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> I had a dark sun spot, size of pea.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s too hard to keep using this because it&#x27;s expesive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It would be unfair to give this product anything less than 5 stars at this point in time, having just received it and started using it.</li>
            <li> Too bad I cant give 0 star.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this serum.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I have an &amp;#34;age spot&amp;#34; on my forehead, recently came up - maybe 6 months ago.  I have used the Shiseido serum since June 18 - am almost finished with my second bottle.  I have faithfully followed the directions for use.  I see absolutely no difference or improvement.  Guess I&#x27;m stuck with my age spot.</li>
            <li> After 3 wks. of using this product daily, I&#x27;ve seen no results yet.  I&#x27;ll keep applying it until the bottle is empty and I might have a different opinion by then.  Also, it&#x27;s a bit pricey so I&#x27;m hoping for some good results.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCTS MAKE MORE BIGGER SUZE THAN THIS</li>
            <li> It would be unfair to give this product anything less than 5 stars at this point in time, having just received it and started using it. So far, it seems to absorb nicely, which means a lot to me with my oily skin. I have the same hopes for the product as everyone else and I&#x27;m trusting others&#x27; reviews are accurate. I&#x27;ll come back to update when I see baby smooth, blemish free skin on my face... which I don&#x27;t expect at my advanced age of 70 years. However, I do trust that the creams from Shiseido will help with evening out skin tones and diminish spots.</li>
            <li> I bought several products in this line and every one of them caused my skin to develop whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my age....pimples?....really????  No thanks.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product and have a good effect on the skin by removing the black spots of the sun, Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is already a well known spot lightener, but the price on this is what attracted me to this seller.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any immediate brightening response,but I use this for several years my skin looks always bright.</li>
            <li> I think Shiseido White Lucent Intensive does have some whitening effect on my skin. Meanwhile I use sunscreen product to ensure there&#x27;s no offset by daily sunshine.</li>
            <li> I knew it would work because I knew Shiseido is good. And it did! My dark spots and dull skin got much brighter. However, it&#x27;s too hard to keep using this because it&#x27;s expesive.  So, this is my special skin care item. I use this serum every end of summer and early autumn, when my skin gets damaged by sun and sweat.  Reset of my skin damages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, and it always works fine for me. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer at the same time, so , great stuff</li>
            <li> Product works as expected. Great seller</li>
            <li> I had a dark sun spot, size of pea. used everything, none show any improvement until I sun shield my driverÂ´s side window &amp;  spot gone  forever  after 1 year.  I have been using the current product for about 5 months,.. Have seen some  improvement  regards to patches of brown spots getting lighter..have also been using brightining facial wash for about 2 years now &amp;  that helps greatly. So, waiting for the brown patches to fade...time will tell.</li>
            <li> After only three weeks of using this product, I&#x27;m noticing a real lightening of my larger brown spots and patches. In the past, I&#x27;ve used two other products twice a day for months/years and never noticed a real difference. A large patch has lightened to the point it&#x27;s hardly noticeable. I understand not all spots are equal, so to speak, so I&#x27;m wondering if I just lucked out with the right product for my specific spots. I wonder if Shiseido being a Japanese company is a factor as I&#x27;m of Chinese ancestry. Anyway, I&#x27;m impressed with the progress so far.</li>
            <li> It was great! Let&#x27;s see how it would work!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks now and the skin is lighten up a little but the brown age spot on both side of my face didn&#x27;t make a different, I will not buy another one after use up this bottle. I am an Asia man 56 year old.</li>
            <li> Does not work. I have been using for 2 months now. No change whatsoever. Too bad I cant give 0 star.</li>
