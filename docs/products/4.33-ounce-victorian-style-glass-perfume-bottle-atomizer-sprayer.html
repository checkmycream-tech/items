            <li>I was so happy to have something that looked so dainty and was practical; I was able to mix all the fragrances that I didn&#x27;t like into this container, making a concoction of scents that I did really like, so thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Bottle is good size and bulb is easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li>so I got this to make it easy to use!</li>
            <li>Works just fine just not as fancy as I would have liked .</li>
            <li>Will buy another one for xmas for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I adore this and will be looking for more like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought perfume in a ready-to-spray bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>purple is a lovely shade of lavender.</li>
            <li>and i am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Cute and functional.</li>
            <li>Really cute on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I love this bottle.</li>
            <li>Webbing is more maroon than what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more in different colors very nice!</li>
            <li>Nice size for a vanity top and is true to the picture shown.</li>
            <li>This is super cute!</li>
            <li>Looks great sitting on top of my bathroom sink with its old look.</li>
            <li>It looks great, but after a couple uses, it simply wouldn&#x27;t spray any more.</li>
            <li>This is such a great perfume bottle it looks so elegant on my vanity</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty and the purple is a nice hue.</li>
            <li>easy to fill, and spays on light.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experience any issues with the atomizer, as it&#x27;s help up just fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>BUT IT WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cute and it works well</li>
            <li>I am very happy it came with the small funnel!</li>
            <li>A BEAUTIFUL ONE IN BLACK</li>
            <li>Looks very pretty, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but very cute.</li>
            <li>We were able to transfer the perfume into this new Victorian Atomizer, saving it.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for someone and they love it so far...</li>
            <li>but it was useful for its purpose.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit everything that I had left in my bottle and still had</li>
            <li>I wanted to house DK Golden Apple in this but took me a while to figure out how to get the perfume out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and looks good with all of my other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add on that it&#x27;s pretty to look at, yet simple and understated, and it&#x27;s easily one of my favorite purchases from amazon.com</li>
            <li>Very nice thick bottle, old school look and the spray effect is nice and even.</li>
            <li>For the price it is just right.</li>
            <li>(It did come with a plastic eye-dropper/pipette that I found right away in the box), but it was useless/tedious.</li>
            <li>It has a really beautiful contoured bottle and just big enough to</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and my 94 year old mom loves it!</li>
            <li>Big enough to hold 3.4ounces and im happy</li>
            <li>However the pump does not work consistently.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying this just to look pretty on a vanity table</li>
            <li>It was ok a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really easy to open and put your perfume into it.  </li>
            <li>i have cologne that came in s large bottle that was cumbersome to use</li>
            <li>The spray pattern is a little different than I used to, but I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Very fancy</li>
            <li>I really like this Atomizer</li>
            <li>I ordered another one, because it&#x27;s about as cheap as mailing it back for a return.</li>
            <li>Sprays very well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>price is a tad high</li>
            <li>I broke my expensive perfume bottle and this was a great replacement for it.</li>
            <li>Really looks like an old fashion atomizer.</li>
            <li>Bought for my mom for mother&#x27;s day to replace a broken perfume bottle, she loved it</li>
            <li>I wanted it to fit with my vanity, and could only hope that it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>No school like the old school!</li>
            <li>I got this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>and I have a bedroom set over 100 years old.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it, and it looks classy on her night stand.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the atomizer, she just bought a bottle of her favorite perfume and the sprayer was broken after she dropped it, so I bought this and popped the old spray hose into her perfume bottle and transferred her perfume into the new sprayer.</li>
            <li>The top to my perfume bottle had broken, and I was looking for an atomizer as a replacement.</li>
            <li>recommend this to other buyers, but it doesn&#x27;t really suit my needs/</li>

            <li> recommend this to other buyers, but it doesn&#x27;t really suit my needs/</li>
            <li> LOW TO AVERAGE QUALITY.</li>
            <li> was not complete missing parts</li>
            <li> After looking and only finding small bottles, I ran across this one.</li>
            <li> If you like feeling like a pin up girl, add this little number to your vanity.</li>
            <li> (never had a clog or issue) and hasn&#x27;t cracked, chipped or broken (even after being dropped numerous times).</li>
            <li> Had a problem with it seeming to get plugged after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> but if actually want to use it it&#x27;s nearly useless.</li>
            <li> Although it did arrive with a plastic funnel to help, pouring liquids into the bottle was very messy.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because atomizers are temperamental and its hard to find one that will work.  </li>
            <li> THIS WAS A HARD TO FIND ITEM FOR ME.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a hard to shop for friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a broken Vera Wang &amp;#34;Lovestruck&amp;#34; perfume bottle that a roommate had knocked off a counter.</li>
            <li> There is a slight leak when I shake the bottle, but it isn&#x27;t so bad that I would dissuade people from buying it.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> but I also needed a sprayer so this was a disappointment.</li>

            <li> Bottle was nice. However the pump does not work consistently. I had to call customer service as the thing wouldn&#x27;t even spray. Every time I squeezed, I just got air.</li>
            <li> This is super cute! Works well!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter to put her PMB perfume and she loves it. Every morning when heading to school, she spritz herself and says now &amp;#34;im ready&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very nice thick bottle, old school look and the spray effect is nice and even.</li>
            <li> Works great! easy to fill, and spays on light.  Looks great sitting on top of my bathroom sink with its old look.</li>
            <li> Big enough to hold 3.4ounces and im happy</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it! It&#x27;s the real deal.  Very fancy but she loves that it isn&#x27;t a toy.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and my 94 year old mom loves it!</li>
            <li> Bottle is good size and bulb is easy to squeeze. Also comes with screw on cap so you can seal bottle for travel or to use later.</li>
            <li> Looks very pretty, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful atomizer that I bought to replace my Isaac Mizrahi perfume atomizer that broke.  I was hesitant because atomizers are temperamental and its hard to find one that will work.  I have been using it for about a month now and it is perfect!  It is so beautiful and works perfectly.  I did not get a funnel or travel cap with my purchase though.</li>
            <li> Cute! Smaller than I thought but very cute.</li>
            <li> I really like this Atomizer, I have not used it yet, but the look alone is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> i have cologne that came in s large bottle that was cumbersome to use so I got this to make it easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price!!  Happy with it.  Love my Amazon shopping!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone and they love it so far...I am very happy it came with the small funnel! Will buy another one for xmas for sure.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend and she loved it. Nice size for a vanity top and is true to the picture shown. Nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom for mother&#x27;s day to replace a broken perfume bottle, she loved it</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product.  I had perfume bottle that would not spray, so I got this bottle.  Works great.  Antique looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I make my own perfume and I have a bedroom set over 100 years old.  I wanted it to fit with my vanity, and could only hope that it actually worked.  I adore this and will be looking for more like it.  It sprays nicely.</li>
            <li> It was ok a little on the cheap side but it was useful for its purpose.Works just fine just not as fancy as I would have liked . For the price it is just right.</li>
            <li> While filling it took patience and the use of a bowl underneath to catch drips, I am very happy with the way it works. You do not need to buy extra funnels - one is included.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the atomizer, she just bought a bottle of her favorite perfume and the sprayer was broken after she dropped it, so I bought this and popped the old spray hose into her perfume bottle and transferred her perfume into the new sprayer. No school like the old school! great product!</li>
            <li> below my expectations.  for some reason it did not spray like it was blocked up.  This was part of the reason I ordered the roll-on perfume bottles</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife after a perfume bottle got dropped and cracked. We were able to transfer the perfume into this new Victorian Atomizer, saving it. My wife loves it, and it looks classy on her night stand.</li>
            <li> The bottle is gorgeous in person. There is a slight leak when I shake the bottle, but it isn&#x27;t so bad that I would dissuade people from buying it. I make my own vitamin c mist and the vitamin e separates  out of the mixture sometimes and starts to clog the tube. If you&#x27;re going to use this as a perfume bottle, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to other buyers, but it doesn&#x27;t really suit my needs/</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted and served the purpose</li>
            <li> I bought this because it reminded me of a perfume sprayer like my Grandma had on her dresser.  I always loved hers &amp; this one reminds me of her.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who would like to remember good things about Grandma&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer 2 years ago. Initially, I had thought that it didn&#x27;t come with a funnel, as it was plastic and I didn&#x27;t see it wrapped in the tissue paper. (It did come with a plastic eye-dropper/pipette that I found right away in the box), but it was useless/tedious. The seller kindly sent me the copper colored metal funnel, and it has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experience any issues with the atomizer, as it&#x27;s help up just fine. I was so happy to have something that looked so dainty and was practical; I was able to mix all the fragrances that I didn&#x27;t like into this container, making a concoction of scents that I did really like, so thanks for a great product. I feel like a proper vintage diva each time I use the atomizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item came inside a cubic white box, stuffed with tissue paper. There&#x27;s the glass bottle, the purple atomizer unit, the silver lid (to use when the atomizer isn&#x27;t in place--good for travel), the funnel, and the pipette.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this just to look pretty on a vanity table it&#x27;s fine but if actually want to use it it&#x27;s nearly useless. The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve trying to use it a couple of months and it&#x27;s nothing but a bottle...no functional sprayer. Fortunaley it does come with a regular cap even it doesn&#x27;t come with a funnel. I needed the larger size but I also needed a sprayer so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought perfume in a ready-to-spray bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The bottle is pretty and the purple is a nice hue. The spray pattern is a little different than I used to, but I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Looks nice but the pump don&#x27;t pray well.</li>
            <li> This atomizer works well (never had a clog or issue) and hasn&#x27;t cracked, chipped or broken (even after being dropped numerous times). Add on that it&#x27;s pretty to look at, yet simple and understated, and it&#x27;s easily one of my favorite purchases from amazon.com</li>
            <li> LOW TO AVERAGE QUALITY. BUT IT WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li> was not complete missing parts</li>
            <li> The top to my perfume bottle had broken, and I was looking for an atomizer as a replacement. After looking and only finding small bottles, I ran across this one. It is the perfect size! I was able to fit everything that I had left in my bottle and still had room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple is a lovely shade of lavender. It looks very nice and not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a funnel, a pipette and a travel cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A HARD TO FIND ITEM FOR ME.  MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT ME A BEAUTIFUL ONE IN BLACK BUT IT WAS JUST TO LOOK AT.  DIDN&#x27;T WORK.  THIS ONE WORKS REALLY GOOD.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for my girlfriend. It looks great, but after a couple uses, it simply wouldn&#x27;t spray any more. Weird. I ordered another one, because it&#x27;s about as cheap as mailing it back for a return. Same problem. Worked a couple times, and then just stopped spraying. Don&#x27;t buy this brand!</li>
            <li> If you like feeling like a pin up girl, add this little number to your vanity. It&#x27;s pretty cute and it works well</li>
            <li> My daughter was overjoyed with this gift and i am pleased with it. It has a really beautiful contoured bottle and just big enough to&lt;br /&gt;hold the amount of perfume she likes!</li>
            <li> wife loves it. price is a tad high but I ordered it anyway. She put her lavender essential oil and a tad of vodka to cut it. Works great!</li>
            <li> This product is a very nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to give it as a gift.....and I would recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I broke my expensive perfume bottle and this was a great replacement for it. It&#x27;s very elegant looking. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is such a great perfume bottle it looks so elegant on my vanity I am going to buy more in different colors very nice!</li>
            <li> Had a problem with it seeming to get plugged after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL PERFUME BOTTLE FOR PERFUME LOVERS AND COLLECTORS!</li>
            <li> Cute and functional. But I would warn people to know how to de-bottle their perfumes BEFORE purchasing. I wanted to house DK Golden Apple in this but took me a while to figure out how to get the perfume out of the bottle. So for a while it collected dust on my vanity until I figured it out. Otherwise a nice atomizer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle. Really looks like an old fashion atomizer. Sprays very well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a birthday. Delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a hard to shop for friend. She loves it and so do I, I&#x27;d like to have one for myself. It works wonderfully, and even came with a funnel, a pipette, and a travel cap for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She loves it and it works perfect. It&#x27;s so beautiful and elegant.  And it&#x27;s really easy to open and put your perfume into it.  The size is nice too.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> Just like the picture&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality</li>
            <li> Really cute on my vanity. I love this bottle. I would order a teeny funnel to fill it.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift and the recipient was happy with it.  Webbing is more maroon than what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in any way. I purchased this to replace a broken Vera Wang &amp;#34;Lovestruck&amp;#34; perfume bottle that a roommate had knocked off a counter. It is very pretty and looks good with all of my other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was getting the perfume into the bottle. Although it did arrive with a plastic funnel to help, pouring liquids into the bottle was very messy.</li>
