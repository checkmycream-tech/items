    <ol>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy about this purchase and would purchase again!</li>
            <li>Excellent cuticule scissors and the price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>I contacted &amp;#34;Jewelry Supply&amp;#34; and I am impressed with their respond and professionalism.</li>
            <li>This  scissor is of a very good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, for the price, these are GREAT.  </li>
            <li>great scissors for the price.</li>
            <li>These are great for working out an ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li>but I think these are a great valve and do the job as hoped.  </li>
            <li>Until now...these are a great replacement.</li>
            <li>This would be good perhaps if you were just using it for cuticles</li>
            <li>bought this because it is a good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is good and it does serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I was not expecting a great pair of scissors but these are well made and come in a nice pkg.</li>
            <li>Much better than worrying about loosing them and never having them when I need them!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, a nice pair of scissors, esp.</li>
            <li>Nice also not what I thought it was.  </li>
            <li>These work great on nails, cuticles, and most importantly, hangnails.  </li>
            <li>Also, great customer service as the first item got stuck somewhere in the postal system and was replaced without delay.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for at a great price and free shipping!  </li>
            <li>They are well weighted and perfect for personal grooming.  </li>
            <li>The scissors worked OK, but in 4 month they just broke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Few people are complaining about not being able to cut cardboard or nails -- these are not meant to cut cardboard or nails, they are cuticle scissors</li>
            <li>Not even sure if it&#x27;s the one from the picture.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>it would be ok.</li>
            <li>They cut very well and they&#x27;re a good price for what I use them for.</li>
            <li>cuts easily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel strong or well made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have strong nails yet this scissor keeps bending when I use</li>
            <li>A little flimsy, but do a great job for what I used them for !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Avoid, even if free.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>extremely cheaply made item</li>
            <li>They are fine for needs that are quick, but if you need to use them a lot, they would probably start hurting your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Amazon offers this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Rust quick</li>
            <li>Overall, these scissors seem nice - they have OK blades, are sharp, the blades seem to meet well, and they work nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty particular about cuticle scissors and find it hard to find a good pair that can cut and get as fine detailed in the corners/tight spots - these have done the trick.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are cheaply made; the first clue was that they didn&#x27;t operate smoothly, after realizing that they couldn&#x27;t cut the cardboard of the packaging it turns out that they are made from low quality steel as well.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, and the blades are nice and close together.  </li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend these to anybody who wants something that lasts.</li>
            <li>very well made.</li>
            <li>These are excellent for cutting off skin tags.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and the blades mesh very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Despite of the very low price I ordered it because of the good reviews, but this product is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li>They would probably not be a good choice for very thick</li>
            <li>They are sharp and cut nails very well, switching from right to left with no change in how they perform.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp with a slick action</li>
            <li>They are cheap enough that if I loose a pair, its not big deal to replace them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried buying some from the local pharmacy, but they were cheap and didn&#x27;t have a sharp enough point.  </li>
            <li>I like these scissors and am using them  often for a variety of tasks from manicures to fine delicate hand work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new pair for a long time and this one definitely fills my bill.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a sharp, sturdy pair similar to an older pair that had fallen apart</li>

            <li> Was looking for a sharp, sturdy pair similar to an older pair that had fallen apart</li>
            <li> great for cutting small tags from clothing also.</li>
            <li> These were a surprise Amazon purchase - reading the reviews some were pretty negative -</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the edges of the finger holes are not as smooth/rounded over as other scissors I&#x27;ve had and it makes them less comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> so keep them dry.</li>
            <li> I easily broke off one of the tines with my thumb and forefingers after  little I realized they were useless; it fell apart with minimal force.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not strong enough to clip harder skin areas around your nails.</li>
            <li> Long ago I bought a fancy little pair of scissors that I used for years until they fell apart.</li>
            <li> Rather flimsy in construction and the metal in the handle actually broke in two after a few weeks and using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> very sharp.</li>
            <li> I hate when there is a gap between them, and you can&#x27;t cut with them easily.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth having to pay shipping for a replacement that would be just as bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste the money.</li>
            <li> Would like them to be a few mm slimmer profile -</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to trim dead leaves off my aquatic plants.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are not as thick as other cuticle scissors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean they fell apart as in the little screw fell out.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with my purchase at all.  </li>
            <li> I can ever use them for something - they are not suitable for cuticles.</li>
            <li> As shipped: a cast handle with a dull blade.</li>
            <li> Very dull blade.</li>
            <li> These scissors are dull and awkward.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shop I bought them at had either gone out of business or moved away</li>
            <li> A quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting nails but it is too blunt.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive brand-name one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At the time I order the scissors, the rating wasn&#x27;t as bad, or I would not buy them.</li>
            <li> Very Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Terrible qualty, threw away after 1 use.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your time and money. A quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but do a great job for what I used them for !</li>
            <li> Sharp, and the blades are nice and close together.  I hate when there is a gap between them, and you can&#x27;t cut with them easily.  These work very well.</li>
            <li> The square design of the handle can pinch my fingers while using these so some care needs to be exercised with how you hold them.  If you plan to use these for pursuits like crafting, it might be a pain to have to be vigilant about their position.  They are well weighted and perfect for personal grooming.  They would probably not be a good choice for very thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for the price, these are GREAT.  They are sharp and cut nails very well, switching from right to left with no change in how they perform.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new pair for a long time and this one definitely fills my bill.</li>
            <li> 4-7-14  This would be good perhaps if you were just using it for cuticles but it is not strong enough to clip harder skin areas around your nails.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive brand-name one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it is a good price.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good and it does serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts easily.</li>
            <li> Very Bad quality. I don&#x27;t know how Amazon offers this kind of product. Despite of the very low price I ordered it because of the good reviews, but this product is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; scissors broke within a week of my using them.  I broke a fingernail and was using these to cut off the rest of the nail and they broke.  I don&#x27;t mean they fell apart as in the little screw fell out.  The handle itself broke.  I do not recommend these to anybody who wants something that lasts.</li>
            <li> I like these scissors and am using them  often for a variety of tasks from manicures to fine delicate hand work.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. What can I expect!?</li>
            <li> At the time I order the scissors, the rating wasn&#x27;t as bad, or I would not buy them. The scissors worked OK, but in 4 month they just broke.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife as they are very similar to cuticle scissors she&#x27;s had before, but has not been able to find in town or when she finds them they are excessively expensive ($12.00 or more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people are complaining about not being able to cut cardboard or nails -- these are not meant to cut cardboard or nails, they are cuticle scissors so if they are being used on that type of material they will not last.  Used as they are intended you should get several years out of these before they become dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes these as they are an arrow point and she prefers that to others that may be called ultra-fine.  These are not as thick as other cuticle scissors.</li>
            <li> great scissors for the price. multi purpose. very sharp. very well made. I use them often. great for cutting small tags from clothing also.</li>
            <li> As shown: one piece blade and handle. As shipped: a cast handle with a dull blade. If you cannot bother to ship what is in the picture, don&#x27;t post a picture.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel strong or well made. Not even sure if it&#x27;s the one from the picture. Will probably toss these.</li>
            <li> Terrible qualty, threw away after 1 use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are great for working out an ingrown toenail.  They are cheap enough that if I loose a pair, its not big deal to replace them.  Much better than worrying about loosing them and never having them when I need them!  Rust quick so keep them dry.</li>
            <li> I was going to throw them away, but kept them in case I can ever use them for something - they are not suitable for cuticles. Very dull blade.</li>
            <li> Overall, these scissors seem nice - they have OK blades, are sharp, the blades seem to meet well, and they work nicely.  My only complaint is that the edges of the finger holes are not as smooth/rounded over as other scissors I&#x27;ve had and it makes them less comfortable to use.  They are fine for needs that are quick, but if you need to use them a lot, they would probably start hurting your fingers.  Otherwise, a nice pair of scissors, esp. for the money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste the money. These scissors are dull and awkward. The edges dont meet to make the cut so like kids safety scissors the article gets pinched inbetween.</li>
            <li> These were a surprise Amazon purchase - reading the reviews some were pretty negative - but I think these are a great valve and do the job as hoped.  I&#x27;m pretty particular about cuticle scissors and find it hard to find a good pair that can cut and get as fine detailed in the corners/tight spots - these have done the trick.  Would like them to be a few mm slimmer profile - but I&#x27;m happy about this purchase and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Excellent cuticule scissors and the price you can&#x27;t beat. I was not expecting a great pair of scissors but these are well made and come in a nice pkg.</li>
            <li> These scissors are cheaply made; the first clue was that they didn&#x27;t operate smoothly, after realizing that they couldn&#x27;t cut the cardboard of the packaging it turns out that they are made from low quality steel as well.  I easily broke off one of the tines with my thumb and forefingers after  little I realized they were useless; it fell apart with minimal force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid, even if free.</li>
            <li> They get the job done and are quality.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for cutting off skin tags.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to trim dead leaves off my aquatic plants. They cut very well and they&#x27;re a good price for what I use them for. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Broke on third use...wasn&#x27;t worth having to pay shipping for a replacement that would be just as bad. I guess that it why it only cost three or so dollars.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp with a slick action</li>
            <li> I bought this pair to replace a pair that broke after 30+ years.  I&#x27;d tried buying some from the local pharmacy, but they were cheap and didn&#x27;t have a sharp enough point.  These work great on nails, cuticles, and most importantly, hangnails.  They are sharp and the blades mesh very smoothly.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> It feels cheap, it is cheap. I just wanted something simple to cut nose hairs with and for that it works. I tried cutting nails but it is too blunt. If you want nail scissors I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Long ago I bought a fancy little pair of scissors that I used for years until they fell apart. Unfortunately the shop I bought them at had either gone out of business or moved away so I picked up replacement scissors here and there and they just did not measure up. Until now...these are a great replacement.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with my purchase at all.  These were flimsy and didn&#x27;t do the job.  I ended up returning them to get my money back.</li>
            <li> extremely cheaply made item</li>
            <li> Rather flimsy in construction and the metal in the handle actually broke in two after a few weeks and using it a few times.  I suppose if it was only used to clip threads etc it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have strong nails yet this scissor keeps bending when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy it again. -</li>
            <li> These are junk. Very cheaply made. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nice also not what I thought it was.  Wanted a sissor like toenail cutter.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sharp, sturdy pair similar to an older pair that had fallen apart but I didn&#x27;t like the ones in stores or their price.  This is exactly what I was looking for at a great price and free shipping!  Also, great customer service as the first item got stuck somewhere in the postal system and was replaced without delay.</li>
            <li> This  scissor is of a very good quality. It didn&#x27;t work for me (for the purpose I ordered it). I contacted &amp;#34;Jewelry Supply&amp;#34; and I am impressed with their respond and professionalism.</li>
