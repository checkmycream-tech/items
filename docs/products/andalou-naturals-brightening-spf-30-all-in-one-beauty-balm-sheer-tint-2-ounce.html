    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The list of ingredients is excellent, so although the color didn&#x27;t work for me, I am now using the Andalou untinted bb-cream.</li>
            <li>I has everything I want (and none of what I don&#x27;t) and leaves my skin looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li>I use it as a primer that works perfectly in conjunction with my dermablend makeup.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the sun protection.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I use all Andalou products and am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li>if you have drier skin, i think this would be perfect for you.</li>

            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>This has an impressive lineup of ingredients which is why I was bummed it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This product is not for very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Great, great product!</li>
            <li>and I am good to go!</li>
            <li>This Andalou sunblock is superior to Neutrogena Ultra-sheer!</li>
            <li>It also evens out skin tone (redness), and is great alone or as a mineral makeup primer.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a great orange scent.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great protection.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it evens out skin tone without needing any foundation</li>
            <li>: The color is great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It handled summer heat well, so I hope it works great with the colder weather.</li>
            <li>Great for every day.</li>
            <li>The color is great on my darker than &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; Caucasian face.</li>
            <li>Has a great texture, doesn&#x27;t make skin feel oily.</li>
            <li>Great product&lt;br /&gt;Mom</li>
            <li>Well, everything about this product is great, except for the tint.</li>
            <li>I am buying it once again because it provides great coverage and keeps my face looking great all day.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Just bought more of this product!!</li>
            <li>but this gives a medium coverage making it very nice if you don&#x27;t like a lot of face makeup.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>But the very best thing is that my skin looks better now with nothing on it.</li>
            <li>After someone with absolutely gorgeous skin recommended this I was so happy to find it here and immediately bought it when I read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I want additional coverage, I put foundation on top for a flawless finish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup most days and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair but the tint seems to be an ok color for me.  </li>
            <li>This non-toxic make up makes my skin shiny (which I prefer to matte) and bright.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is perfect for people with a brown hue, which is amazing to find.</li>
            <li>I have fair to light skin and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>This cream gives a dewy finish with good hydration.</li>
            <li>It also gives good protection.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have good protection from the sun and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>stay away if you have fair skin, unless you like looking like an orange oompa loompa.</li>
            <li>I loved how it looked and felt, but it didn&#x27;t work with my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen level.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this cream because of the good reviews from EWG.  </li>
            <li>This has good coverage</li>
            <li>I have to wait a good 30 seconds before I can apply mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>I tried the sampler at the store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>good coverage, good color</li>
            <li>but its still a good one just hoping they remove the alcohol.</li>
            <li>The products are well-priced and do not break me out, very natural, rated very good on EWG, and smell good!!  </li>
            <li>I realize it may not match everyone&#x27;s skin tone perfectly, so perhaps I got lucky</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh oranges, and hydrates my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer &amp; good for when you just want light makeup.</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>For me, I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smell, and LOOKS ok, but i couldn&#x27;t get used to the feel.</li>
            <li>This one is very nice, looks natural and has a very pleasant smell and spf 20 helps.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it looked great like a glow of lightly bronzed sun kissed skin.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works well, and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>it has nice smell</li>
            <li>The tinted color blends in quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try the rose one.</li>
            <li>Tint blends well and leaves a nice coverage.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, evens out my skin tone and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I went to another store and got the un-tinted kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is nice.  </li>
            <li>Even without dimethicone this has a really nice feel to it that I find very easy to spread over my skin.</li>
            <li>so I decided I wanted to try the 1000 roses version since I LOVE rose water and anything rose for the face.</li>
            <li>This BB is a perfect match for my fair complexion (with red undertones.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, just like perfume.</li>
            <li>Goes on great, smells pretty good and gives me sun coverage which I love.</li>
            <li>Love Andalou and love this product!</li>
            <li>By far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s free of chemicals, contains lots of ingredients good for your skin, protects it</li>
            <li>The most amazing makeup product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>takes a good while before i feel comfortable putting any powder or blush over it.</li>
            <li>loved my skin... Success!</li>
            <li>do appreciate the good rating from EWG for safe ingredients, the quality ingredients, the way my skin looks--healthy, smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin shade is very fair, and the tint is perfect for me---not too much and definitely not orange.  </li>
            <li>I have coupled this with the andalou naturals brightening skin polish and have been pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, with no caking or clumps.</li>
            <li>Very light coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Love it; very light and so sometimes mix in a bit of foundation.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and</li>
            <li>so I have to wear powder on top of this, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love how this product looks on my skin, but it contains citrus oil (orange), which studies show makes the skin more prone to sun damage (wrinkles, spots).  </li>
            <li>helps promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance on this.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff .</li>
            <li>I love BB creams, and I am trying to switch all of my beauty products to natural/toxic free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for more coverage, you might want to use this under foundation or as a base/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this BB cream and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>Perfect for aging skin that needs extra moisture.  </li>
            <li>I was also hoping for something that was more luminous than a matte coverage</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for something more matte (and drying in my opinion) this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>It happens to work ok with my skin tone, brightening it a bit.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>it blends in and for the most part, this is all you need</li>
            <li>I wear clinique even better make up color &amp;#34;linen&amp;#34; which is even lighter then alabaster.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it smells like oranges.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling and lovely light scent.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t react with my skin, love that it has spf</li>
            <li>the price point for this product is outstanding for what it</li>
            <li>im sure.  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything with a tint that didn&#x27;t immediately make my flakey skin more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 star if the tint was a bit more...</li>
            <li>I love , love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this beauty balm...</li>
            <li>This sunscreen more than met my expectations</li>
            <li>I was looking for a healthy spf cream and this BB cream meets the requirements.</li>
            <li>Love, love love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is thicker than any sunscreen I have ever used, so I cut it 50/50 with my favorite non-SPF face lotion from Alaffia.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be ok given my foundation colour.</li>
            <li>Would not want to get on a handle with care top or around the neckline of a blouse.</li>
            <li>But, I just don&#x27;t feel like using them most days.</li>
            <li>More like a tinted moisturizer IMO.</li>
            <li>My favorite tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I use all organic products on my face and was looking for an inexpensive sunblock for my face that was &#x27;safe&#x27; and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>it is in the top running.</li>
            <li>She is ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and feels great on my skin all day.</li>
            <li>I love the SPF coverage without the risk of break-outs that many sunblocks cause.</li>
            <li>A shame about how it advertises that the color matches most skin types, though.</li>
            <li>I think the product earned 5 stars for using such great ingredients that it gets good reviews on the EWG web site.</li>
            <li>I Love this product</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the scent!</li>
            <li>Adds a lovely sheen to your face, but doesn&#x27;t have strong color if you&#x27;re looking for that.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>If you have light skin toned that needs a fuller coverage this product may not be for you, as the more you use the more orange</li>
            <li>The rich cream goes on very smoothly and evenly, giving me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>give it a good rating because, like I said, I&#x27;m sure it would probably be great for a medium-skinned gal with dryness and no acne scars, dark circles, hyperpigmentation, etc.</li>
            <li>I trust ANDALOU  and use several of their products with very good results.</li>
            <li>It does, however make your skin appear more even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural foundation.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and I love that it has SPF in it.</li>
            <li>I really love all the ingredients and the light airy feel of this product.</li>
            <li>I am really committed to finding a good sunscreen</li>
            <li>have combination skin, not terrifically oily, so maybe this would be good for very dry-skinned people.</li>
            <li>cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it has a nice citrus smell at first, but then it smells more like strong perfumed makeup throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like that it is tinted and easily blends in with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Specifically that it is silicone or more importantly dimethicone free and zinc based with an SPF of 30.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit strong</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want that strong of a scent on my face, it&#x27;d overpowering to the point of inducing a headache.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is a strong citrus smell</li>
            <li>but my face was fine.  </li>
            <li>I first want to say I love the coverage this gives and the healthy glow it gives me.</li>
            <li>This has a light feel but covers/evens skin tone--It blends in easily.</li>
            <li>The feel of it has been just fine.</li>
            <li>It is slightly drying which means not so good for winter skin but lovely for summer skin and because its tinted, gives a summer-like glow; however it should be noted that because of the tint it is best for light-medium to darker tanned skins, or you can do what I&#x27;ve been doing, mix in a bit of your untinted moisturizer to sheer it out a bit.</li>
            <li>But I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>But I would buy their tinted version if it were available in a neutral tone.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light organic foundation to wear on days</li>
            <li>This gives a nice color and leaves you with a very dewy look.  </li>
            <li>This fit the bill, plus gives me a touch of color and matt finish.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and lasts, it does not leave those lines where you don&#x27;t quite smooth the foundation on the edges of your face.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin</li>
            <li>This tint is slightly yellow, so it works great for my skin color, but it&#x27;s just too slippery for</li>
            <li>so its meant to be light tint.  </li>
            <li>I like how it goes on smooth and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING (citrus) and was on the EWG list of very low-toxicity BB creams, so that&#x27;s the biggest reason&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still heavy, but for a day out it&#x27;s perfect because my skin is well protected.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks plump and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I use this under a light coat of face powder.</li>
            <li>so I feel like it&#x27;s fairly versatile for most skin, unless any yellow is a no-</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this BB cream is as good as the Boscia BB Cream - another natural line.</li>
            <li>I use Andalou products for most of my beauty needs, but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I wish all natural cosmetic products were as good as this one</li>
            <li>My skin is too fair for the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade of most tinted moisturizers, and \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; or \\&quot;alabaster\\&quot; is more likely to be right for me than \\&quot;ivory\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it has such great, natural ingredients, as well as SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant citrus smell (it is a bit weird to be smearing your face in something that smells like you should eat it, but I kind of like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, this is not the best product for two reasons</li>
            <li>Totally non-oily and very nice.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well the sunscreen is working, but it smells great an goes on nice, not sticky like Badger tinted.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li>But at least it&#x27;s pleasant smelling and (hopefully) good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Best for people with dry skin,may be too much moisture for those with oily skin types.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and it just gives me a bit more color without looking like I spent too much time at a tanning salon or with a self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>This natural BB is moisturizing and smells like yummy oranges,the color is sheer but its best for light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy so far!</li>
            <li>clean and nourishing</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try something else, and I bought this product because I was looking for a BB cream that was more natural than most.</li>
            <li>But I keep defaulting to the tried and true version I am familiar with.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely - kind of reminiscent of oranges - and the color was just right for my light skin.</li>
            <li>This natural sunscreen product goes on smoothly, has a great feeling, and provides a touch of coverage that&#x27;s totally natural looking.</li>
            <li>The smell is great (minimal and orangey-fruity from the stem cells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cool thing is you can wear this alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li>Similar to the BB cream that I use from Korea, but it sits more lightly on the skin and feels more breathable.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is fair but has some red in it.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and have a fair medium Northern European complexion.</li>
            <li>I have a medium-tan complexion (see Iredale&#x27;s Golden Glow), and this appears a shade too light until I apply powder.</li>
            <li>But on me, I feel there&#x27;s no way I can leave the house without dabbing powder on my face as well, and that kind of defeats the natural, breathable perks of a BB cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Because of this I do no need a full coverage foundation.  </li>
            <li>, sheer but good coverage.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I really hope they come out with more shades.</li>
            <li>This BB provides nice, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars because it probably works fine for people with light or medium skin tone, and its other features were good.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges easily and is kind of sticky on your skin.</li>
            <li>While I loved the samples of the blush and eye shadow from Fairie Organics, I was less than pleased with the mineral concealer.  </li>
            <li>Or great under other makeup.</li>
            <li>This is invisible on my skin, and similar to a perfect sheer foundation.  </li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredient and it feels light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The tint is definitely not for everybody, this is best for people with yellow skin tones .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly porcelain fair, though I guess I&#x27;m rather light, and it&#x27;s still a shade orange for me.</li>
            <li>So, so happy I was introduced to Andalou Naturals and that I finally have a decent, non-irritating zink based sunblock to wear this year.</li>
            <li>But it feels good on, it has a decent SPF, and it has not caused any breakouts or itching for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this new BB cream.</li>
            <li>Great protection and slight color.</li>
            <li>it can be powdered over, but i am very sensitive to too many layers on my skin, so prefer not to powder.</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct odor but to me, it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this one long, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>All the redness is gone in just a few days, the pore size diminished, and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>so I just rub it in really well and then lightly apply a mineral powder over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It evens out my tone and leaves me feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin is important to me, and this product instantly makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>The smell with this is fresh orange and the texture is creamy.</li>
            <li>more natural sunblocks contain dimethicone to give it slip and make it easier to blend in.  </li>
            <li>If you use a face oil, wait until the oil is absorbed before you apply this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>And, this does look distinctly orange out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Nice sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, the way it feels on my skin, and it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>my face looks so moisture and fresh.</li>
            <li>will update this review if it causes a rash or something, but as of right now, no issues!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells slightly of citrus--very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Seriously my skin has never looked and felt this good!</li>
            <li>It would be better though If they could just get rid of the orange tint and smell, and made it conceal a little better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know you are using a product that isn&#x27;t bad for you, the EWG.org/skindeep score for this is very good.  </li>
            <li>This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for:  highly organic/non-toxic (gets great reviews on the EWG cosmetics database), and just the right color to darken my skin tone slightly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and feels  soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and still works really well.</li>
            <li>Most natural products have funny smells to me, but this one is very fruity.</li>
            <li>This is actually a very good product if compared to other &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; cosmetics, which too often fall short on performance.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of Andalou, and was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li>If your complexion is neutral or cool tone, you could use a light application of this cream to create an instant suntanned look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they include a potentially harmful ingredient in this otherwise lovely product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I really like this BB cream!</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s GMO free, gluten-free, paraben-free, and all natural.</li>
            <li>all natural, which is most important to me, especially when it works as well as synthetic ingredients, without the associated harm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, but it offers the light amount of coverage I am looking for.</li>
            <li>it seems to have good ingredients, absorbs well after the first few minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It is not completely sheer, but would probably blend well over most medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy</li>
            <li>It sooths the constant redness and burning that I have and the tint in it helps neutralize most of the redness.</li>
            <li>Although this only has zinc and not titanium dioxide as the SPF, I still apply powder with titanium dioxide and my makeup does go on much better after I put this beauty balm on.  </li>
            <li>I guess I just didn&#x27;t realize this was more makeup than facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and not only does it protect my skin from the sun it moisturizes it well.</li>
            <li>when first applied, it leaves a satin finish without looking greasy, but after about 30 minutes it darkens quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and looks more even, but it definitely gave my skin an orange tint.</li>
            <li>I had heard about \\&quot;BB\\&quot; creams, but didn&#x27;t know exactly what they were.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I was looking for a beauty balm that was cruelty free and natural.</li>
            <li>appreciate a company that is trying to do the right thing in terms of the ingredients it&#x27;s using, and really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I also have a fair amount of old sun damage and rough patches.</li>
            <li>, it has hyaluronic acid which i love the most but its kinda thick and just found out that theres an alcohol in it</li>
            <li>I have other Andalou products and have found them to be gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a daily sunblock and this one had a high rating from the EWG&#x27;s Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Has a slight tint which blends nicely.</li>
            <li>and I have a strong tan and use yellow based foundations.</li>
            <li>I am around some chemically sensitive people and they tell me they can smell when I have this product on, smells like grapefruit (not unpleasant to me.)</li>
            <li>It;s nice and dewy but then also feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and the physical sun protection in this, but with light skin this oxidizes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>However, this product is very sticky and the stickiness does not go away with time, your face stays sticky the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Liking this really took me by surprise.</li>
            <li>really like this cream.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sold at Whole Foods, so try and get a sample of it from Whole Foods to try on your skin, and let it sit all day before deciding to buy,</li>
            <li>Takes a bit more rubbing than non mineral sunscreens but not much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream and will be using again.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel and the coverage of this product as well as the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It was very hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this...</li>
            <li>Powdering the T-Zone is something I also do when wearing this because it gives a very dewy finished.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel when its on my face and in winter i&#x27;ll use the untinted one With or without foundation</li>
            <li>I like it that much.</li>
            <li>The color is too much for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t cover that much.</li>
            <li>the tint is a light to med, yellow- peachy shade.  </li>
            <li>It really is a bit orange</li>
            <li>and he is very perceptive to these things.</li>
            <li>VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>(it dries fast)</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It is also very oily and bought my out in pimples.</li>
            <li>I always have it at the ready.</li>
            <li>However, it has a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell that stays with me all day.  </li>
            <li>applying it, this BB cream leaves my face very oily and shinning.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it because I like the whole line</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But, I put it on and blended it in really well, and I had no noticeable orange tint on my face.</li>
            <li>and I get to use my housemate&#x27;s discount, which makes it very affordable,</li>
            <li>Dont have to use much.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they are using to much.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much happier.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try anything on my skin, as I didn&#x27;t want anything to aggravate my dermatitis (mostly contained to my chin area), yet this product caught my eye at my local natural health store.  </li>
            <li>I know the description says &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34;, but other &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; bb creams gives you just a very light sheen coverage.  </li>
            <li>Next time I think I&#x27;ll order their other 1000 Roses cream as it seems to have more actual coverage and omits the orange oil (can be photosensitizing) in favor of rose.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell, but it is so strong and lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to it being a top BB cream on EWG.ORG.</li>
            <li>I should have taken more notice of other reviews.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than most moisturizers packaged in a tube due to the minerals</li>
            <li>And rather than a yellow tone, it&#x27;s more reddish/orangish which is not fitting for most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>this tint is very light and will not cover dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I also have a lot of sun damage with dark age spots, and this seems to be helping make my skin tone look better.  </li>
            <li>I need more concealer for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the full price ($21.99) as I got it for around $12 bucks and the full price seems a little high to me.  </li>
            <li>Andalou could make the color more universally flattering by taking a tip from the mineral makeup industry: adding a hint of ultramarine blue to create a truly neutral color.  </li>
            <li>The cream covered some of my freckles, so the coverage seems decent.</li>
            <li>I tested this and the other BB SPFs from Andalou while at Lucky&#x27;s, and found this one to be just the right amount of creamy and hydrating for me.</li>
            <li>It looks good on my pale irish skin.</li>
            <li>also highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this product and was highly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is all natural and pure.</li>
            <li>The tone is definitely a peachy one that gives a hint of color even though this really pretty much has zero coverage.</li>
            <li>I love that it uses zinc as the sunscreen rather than harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I suspect a lot of this is caused by the sea buckthorn oil present in this along with the orange essential, which this BB cream smells strongly of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral: It has a natural citrus scent which I really like; however, it might bother folks that are very sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use alot of other andalou products which has helped my skin become supple and acne free.</li>
            <li>I mentioned I was looking for a new foundation with SPF that was non-toxic, and</li>
            <li>We live in the mountains and this saves my skin all year.</li>
            <li>Over the month or so that I used it, it was feeling harder and harder to get my face clean, and I often used an exfoliator just to feel my familiar skin texture again.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle fruity smell as well.</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to provide good coverage and provides sun protection.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to a lot of products that claim to be hypoallergenic, and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It just gave me a very natural, healthy-looking</li>
            <li>i never break out with it on, though, and i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even many (if not most)</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and  I&#x27;m almost done with my first tube which I purchased two months ago.</li>
            <li>Start with a small quantity and apply more as you need it.  </li>
            <li>At first the product looks slightly orange-yellow, but after a few minutes it looks like my own skin color.</li>
            <li>really like this bb cream, which unlike many recent bb entries, actually has ingredients that actively do something for the skin beyond cosmetic effect.  </li>
            <li>Great SPF and works well with my dry skin even though I may need a little extra moisture underneath in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Bare Minerals CC cream for</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; conceal as much as my other BB cream, and it does have a mild orange tint to it</li>
            <li>I would order again but maybe a clear one from the range for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my semi-dry sensitive Asian skin.  </li>
            <li>but I am much happier with the Physicians Formula BB Cream I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li>This cream will only match very warm-tone completions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li>I does provide sun protection, it is all natural &amp; it works well under my makeup</li>
            <li>Seconds after applying my eyes begin to burn and water even if I don&#x27;t use it near my eye area.</li>
            <li>It is very sheer and does not provide much coverage over blemishes, etc.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very dewy finish and makes your skin look healthier instantly.</li>
            <li>I may try the Andalou Naturals BB Skin Perfecting Beauty Balm SPF 30 Natural instead...</li>
            <li>As the package indicates, it is sheer, so dont expect much coverage.  </li>
            <li>keep looking for a natural cleanser that takes this stuff off.</li>
            <li>Really though, I like it well enough.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural sunscreen for the summer that won&#x27;t break out your skin, but gives you that sunkissed glow</li>
            <li>it gives a sheer coverage, blending out skin tone and really does liven up skin without looking made up.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product as my daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I had used to buy facial sunscreen that was SPF30, free of chemicals but a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I frequently get asked about it since I often wear it instead of makeup.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far seems just like the others have said.</li>
            <li>So I try not to apply it so much near my nose.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and even toned.  </li>
            <li>My acne is completely gone</li>
            <li>I wear this alone with eye concealer and a bit of blush for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product as I&#x27;m on my second tube.  </li>
            <li>Offers light coverage without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li>This was a full shade too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and with the summer heat in the 100s I was looking for a natural teneted beauty balm with high spf as I am a red head.</li>
            <li>I have used this for two days and have not broken out (this usually happens quickly) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive, light, Irish skin, and I refuse to use products that have parabens and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few BB creams before that were decent, but this, I really give all thumbs up (should add a few hands for more thumbs).  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I like a natural product like this that gives me high enough SPF and all natural ingredient</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s also not for people with any serious skin issues they want to cover, unless they want to keep piling on more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend trying it if you are a conscientious cosmetics user looking for a decent BB.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian, medium light, with a slight yellow undertone, but with ruddy (reddish) cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you a lot of coverage compared to normal makeup, but it is enough for me.</li>
            <li>I apply my normal moisturizer prior to applying the BB.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that the color might be too dark because I have a fair complexion, but it is summer right now and the color blends into my skin for a very natural look.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little on the thick side so doesn&#x27;t apply super easily</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d love to see a lighter color or something a little less &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; it seems to look natural (I think!)</li>
            <li>It has a sheer tan tint, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m still giving it such a high review, though, is because it has everything that I would like in such a product, coverage, spf, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>However I have mature skin ands use natural oils as my moisturizing routine, and Bare Essentials powder as my daily makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin in the winter that usually causes my makeup to cake and flake, but this really helps my dry skin to be more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like I barely have any coverage and still need some concealer.</li>
            <li>Finally found a bb cream that has it all - brightening, a touch of coverage, moisture, natural ingredients and spf.</li>
            <li>looks super too dark at first, but does blend in well with my winter pale yellow toned skin,</li>
            <li>I do like the way it feels...its light and not too greasy, and it spreads well over your entire face so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If it were just slightly mattifying and had no SPF I would love this, but not as is and not really even with mixing with other lotion.</li>
            <li>The only real concern I had from other reviewers was the color match.  </li>
            <li>Also not a long term solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>it feels a bit heavy at first, dare i say,even oily, and it is a bit shiny, but settles on skin after 30min or so.</li>
            <li>the jury&#x27;s still out on whether i&#x27;ll get it again - going to try a few others first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale with freckles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd, because it squirts out of the bottle looking very opaque, but then it goes on</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin that is slightly sensitive, I was worried that the citrus in this creme would bother my skin but irritation did not occur at all.</li>
            <li>20% zinc oxide sun filtration, fruit stem cells, vit c, hyaluronic acid and a host of anti-oxidants in meaningful concentrations, not just tacked on the end of a long list of cheap ingredients, in a base formula with aloe and jojoba.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>I really did not find that it concealed any redness but the peachy undertone does mask any white cast that zinc oxcide can typically give.</li>
            <li>: It is a little pricey but, given the ingredients, I think it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>But, a little concealer, mascara, and lip gloss, and I would be ready to go out on the town.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The list of ingredients is excellent, so although the color didn&#x27;t work for me, I am now using the Andalou untinted bb-cream.</li>
            <li> I has everything I want (and none of what I don&#x27;t) and leaves my skin looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I use it as a primer that works perfectly in conjunction with my dermablend makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the sun protection.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I use all Andalou products and am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> if you have drier skin, i think this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Nicely done andalou!!!!</li>
            <li> awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and this works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> It is great!</li>
            <li> This has an impressive lineup of ingredients which is why I was bummed it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is not for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> Great, great product!</li>
            <li> and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> This Andalou sunblock is superior to Neutrogena Ultra-sheer!</li>
            <li> It also evens out skin tone (redness), and is great alone or as a mineral makeup primer.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a great orange scent.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great protection.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it evens out skin tone without needing any foundation</li>
            <li> : The color is great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It handled summer heat well, so I hope it works great with the colder weather.</li>
            <li> Great for every day.</li>
            <li> The color is great on my darker than &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; Caucasian face.</li>
            <li> Has a great texture, doesn&#x27;t make skin feel oily.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Mom</li>
            <li> Well, everything about this product is great, except for the tint.</li>
            <li> I am buying it once again because it provides great coverage and keeps my face looking great all day.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Just bought more of this product!!</li>
            <li> but this gives a medium coverage making it very nice if you don&#x27;t like a lot of face makeup.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> But the very best thing is that my skin looks better now with nothing on it.</li>
            <li> After someone with absolutely gorgeous skin recommended this I was so happy to find it here and immediately bought it when I read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> When I want additional coverage, I put foundation on top for a flawless finish.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup most days and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair but the tint seems to be an ok color for me.  </li>
            <li> This non-toxic make up makes my skin shiny (which I prefer to matte) and bright.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is perfect for people with a brown hue, which is amazing to find.</li>
            <li> I have fair to light skin and this is perfect!</li>
            <li> This cream gives a dewy finish with good hydration.</li>
            <li> It also gives good protection.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have good protection from the sun and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> stay away if you have fair skin, unless you like looking like an orange oompa loompa.</li>
            <li> I loved how it looked and felt, but it didn&#x27;t work with my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen level.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream because of the good reviews from EWG.  </li>
            <li> This has good coverage</li>
            <li> I have to wait a good 30 seconds before I can apply mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I tried the sampler at the store and loved it.  </li>
            <li> good coverage, good color</li>
            <li> but its still a good one just hoping they remove the alcohol.</li>
            <li> The products are well-priced and do not break me out, very natural, rated very good on EWG, and smell good!!  </li>
            <li> I realize it may not match everyone&#x27;s skin tone perfectly, so perhaps I got lucky</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh oranges, and hydrates my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer &amp; good for when you just want light makeup.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> For me, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It does have a pleasant smell, and LOOKS ok, but i couldn&#x27;t get used to the feel.</li>
            <li> This one is very nice, looks natural and has a very pleasant smell and spf 20 helps.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> it looked great like a glow of lightly bronzed sun kissed skin.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works well, and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> it has nice smell</li>
            <li> The tinted color blends in quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try the rose one.</li>
            <li> Tint blends well and leaves a nice coverage.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, evens out my skin tone and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I went to another store and got the un-tinted kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is nice.  </li>
            <li> Even without dimethicone this has a really nice feel to it that I find very easy to spread over my skin.</li>
            <li> so I decided I wanted to try the 1000 roses version since I LOVE rose water and anything rose for the face.</li>
            <li> This BB is a perfect match for my fair complexion (with red undertones.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong, just like perfume.</li>
            <li> Goes on great, smells pretty good and gives me sun coverage which I love.</li>
            <li> Love Andalou and love this product!</li>
            <li> By far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s free of chemicals, contains lots of ingredients good for your skin, protects it</li>
            <li> The most amazing makeup product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> takes a good while before i feel comfortable putting any powder or blush over it.</li>
            <li> loved my skin... Success!</li>
            <li> do appreciate the good rating from EWG for safe ingredients, the quality ingredients, the way my skin looks--healthy, smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin shade is very fair, and the tint is perfect for me---not too much and definitely not orange.  </li>
            <li> I have coupled this with the andalou naturals brightening skin polish and have been pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth, with no caking or clumps.</li>
            <li> Very light coverage.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Love it; very light and so sometimes mix in a bit of foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and</li>
            <li> so I have to wear powder on top of this, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love how this product looks on my skin, but it contains citrus oil (orange), which studies show makes the skin more prone to sun damage (wrinkles, spots).  </li>
            <li> helps promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance on this.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff .</li>
            <li> I love BB creams, and I am trying to switch all of my beauty products to natural/toxic free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for more coverage, you might want to use this under foundation or as a base/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this BB cream and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for aging skin that needs extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> I was also hoping for something that was more luminous than a matte coverage</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for something more matte (and drying in my opinion) this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> It happens to work ok with my skin tone, brightening it a bit.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> it blends in and for the most part, this is all you need</li>
            <li> I wear clinique even better make up color &amp;#34;linen&amp;#34; which is even lighter then alabaster.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it smells like oranges.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling and lovely light scent.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t react with my skin, love that it has spf</li>
            <li> the price point for this product is outstanding for what it</li>
            <li> im sure.  </li>
            <li> I have never found anything with a tint that didn&#x27;t immediately make my flakey skin more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 star if the tint was a bit more...</li>
            <li> I love , love this makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty balm...</li>
            <li> This sunscreen more than met my expectations</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthy spf cream and this BB cream meets the requirements.</li>
            <li> Love, love love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is thicker than any sunscreen I have ever used, so I cut it 50/50 with my favorite non-SPF face lotion from Alaffia.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be ok given my foundation colour.</li>
            <li> Would not want to get on a handle with care top or around the neckline of a blouse.</li>
            <li> But, I just don&#x27;t feel like using them most days.</li>
            <li> More like a tinted moisturizer IMO.</li>
            <li> My favorite tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I use all organic products on my face and was looking for an inexpensive sunblock for my face that was &#x27;safe&#x27; and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> it is in the top running.</li>
            <li> She is ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and feels great on my skin all day.</li>
            <li> I love the SPF coverage without the risk of break-outs that many sunblocks cause.</li>
            <li> A shame about how it advertises that the color matches most skin types, though.</li>
            <li> I think the product earned 5 stars for using such great ingredients that it gets good reviews on the EWG web site.</li>
            <li> I Love this product</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the scent!</li>
            <li> Adds a lovely sheen to your face, but doesn&#x27;t have strong color if you&#x27;re looking for that.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> If you have light skin toned that needs a fuller coverage this product may not be for you, as the more you use the more orange</li>
            <li> The rich cream goes on very smoothly and evenly, giving me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> give it a good rating because, like I said, I&#x27;m sure it would probably be great for a medium-skinned gal with dryness and no acne scars, dark circles, hyperpigmentation, etc.</li>
            <li> I trust ANDALOU  and use several of their products with very good results.</li>
            <li> It does, however make your skin appear more even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural foundation.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and I love that it has SPF in it.</li>
            <li> I really love all the ingredients and the light airy feel of this product.</li>
            <li> I am really committed to finding a good sunscreen</li>
            <li> have combination skin, not terrifically oily, so maybe this would be good for very dry-skinned people.</li>
            <li> cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it has a nice citrus smell at first, but then it smells more like strong perfumed makeup throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I like that it is tinted and easily blends in with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Specifically that it is silicone or more importantly dimethicone free and zinc based with an SPF of 30.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily</li>
            <li> It does smell a bit strong</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want that strong of a scent on my face, it&#x27;d overpowering to the point of inducing a headache.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is a strong citrus smell</li>
            <li> but my face was fine.  </li>
            <li> I first want to say I love the coverage this gives and the healthy glow it gives me.</li>
            <li> This has a light feel but covers/evens skin tone--It blends in easily.</li>
            <li> The feel of it has been just fine.</li>
            <li> It is slightly drying which means not so good for winter skin but lovely for summer skin and because its tinted, gives a summer-like glow; however it should be noted that because of the tint it is best for light-medium to darker tanned skins, or you can do what I&#x27;ve been doing, mix in a bit of your untinted moisturizer to sheer it out a bit.</li>
            <li> But I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> But I would buy their tinted version if it were available in a neutral tone.</li>
            <li> I wanted a light organic foundation to wear on days</li>
            <li> This gives a nice color and leaves you with a very dewy look.  </li>
            <li> This fit the bill, plus gives me a touch of color and matt finish.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and lasts, it does not leave those lines where you don&#x27;t quite smooth the foundation on the edges of your face.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin</li>
            <li> This tint is slightly yellow, so it works great for my skin color, but it&#x27;s just too slippery for</li>
            <li> so its meant to be light tint.  </li>
            <li> I like how it goes on smooth and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING (citrus) and was on the EWG list of very low-toxicity BB creams, so that&#x27;s the biggest reason&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still heavy, but for a day out it&#x27;s perfect because my skin is well protected.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks plump and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this under a light coat of face powder.</li>
            <li> so I feel like it&#x27;s fairly versatile for most skin, unless any yellow is a no-</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this BB cream is as good as the Boscia BB Cream - another natural line.</li>
            <li> I use Andalou products for most of my beauty needs, but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I wish all natural cosmetic products were as good as this one</li>
            <li> My skin is too fair for the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade of most tinted moisturizers, and \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; or \\&quot;alabaster\\&quot; is more likely to be right for me than \\&quot;ivory\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has such great, natural ingredients, as well as SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant citrus smell (it is a bit weird to be smearing your face in something that smells like you should eat it, but I kind of like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, this is not the best product for two reasons</li>
            <li> Totally non-oily and very nice.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well the sunscreen is working, but it smells great an goes on nice, not sticky like Badger tinted.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s pleasant smelling and (hopefully) good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best for people with dry skin,may be too much moisture for those with oily skin types.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and it just gives me a bit more color without looking like I spent too much time at a tanning salon or with a self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> This natural BB is moisturizing and smells like yummy oranges,the color is sheer but its best for light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy so far!</li>
            <li> clean and nourishing</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something else, and I bought this product because I was looking for a BB cream that was more natural than most.</li>
            <li> But I keep defaulting to the tried and true version I am familiar with.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely - kind of reminiscent of oranges - and the color was just right for my light skin.</li>
            <li> This natural sunscreen product goes on smoothly, has a great feeling, and provides a touch of coverage that&#x27;s totally natural looking.</li>
            <li> The smell is great (minimal and orangey-fruity from the stem cells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cool thing is you can wear this alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> Similar to the BB cream that I use from Korea, but it sits more lightly on the skin and feels more breathable.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is fair but has some red in it.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and have a fair medium Northern European complexion.</li>
            <li> I have a medium-tan complexion (see Iredale&#x27;s Golden Glow), and this appears a shade too light until I apply powder.</li>
            <li> But on me, I feel there&#x27;s no way I can leave the house without dabbing powder on my face as well, and that kind of defeats the natural, breathable perks of a BB cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Because of this I do no need a full coverage foundation.  </li>
            <li> , sheer but good coverage.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really hope they come out with more shades.</li>
            <li> This BB provides nice, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars because it probably works fine for people with light or medium skin tone, and its other features were good.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges easily and is kind of sticky on your skin.</li>
            <li> While I loved the samples of the blush and eye shadow from Fairie Organics, I was less than pleased with the mineral concealer.  </li>
            <li> Or great under other makeup.</li>
            <li> This is invisible on my skin, and similar to a perfect sheer foundation.  </li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredient and it feels light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The tint is definitely not for everybody, this is best for people with yellow skin tones .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly porcelain fair, though I guess I&#x27;m rather light, and it&#x27;s still a shade orange for me.</li>
            <li> So, so happy I was introduced to Andalou Naturals and that I finally have a decent, non-irritating zink based sunblock to wear this year.</li>
            <li> But it feels good on, it has a decent SPF, and it has not caused any breakouts or itching for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this new BB cream.</li>
            <li> Great protection and slight color.</li>
            <li> it can be powdered over, but i am very sensitive to too many layers on my skin, so prefer not to powder.</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct odor but to me, it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this one long, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> All the redness is gone in just a few days, the pore size diminished, and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> so I just rub it in really well and then lightly apply a mineral powder over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It evens out my tone and leaves me feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin is important to me, and this product instantly makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> The smell with this is fresh orange and the texture is creamy.</li>
            <li> more natural sunblocks contain dimethicone to give it slip and make it easier to blend in.  </li>
            <li> If you use a face oil, wait until the oil is absorbed before you apply this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> And, this does look distinctly orange out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Nice sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, the way it feels on my skin, and it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> my face looks so moisture and fresh.</li>
            <li> will update this review if it causes a rash or something, but as of right now, no issues!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells slightly of citrus--very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Seriously my skin has never looked and felt this good!</li>
            <li> It would be better though If they could just get rid of the orange tint and smell, and made it conceal a little better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know you are using a product that isn&#x27;t bad for you, the EWG.org/skindeep score for this is very good.  </li>
            <li> This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for:  highly organic/non-toxic (gets great reviews on the EWG cosmetics database), and just the right color to darken my skin tone slightly.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and feels  soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and still works really well.</li>
            <li> Most natural products have funny smells to me, but this one is very fruity.</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good product if compared to other &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; cosmetics, which too often fall short on performance.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Andalou, and was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li> If your complexion is neutral or cool tone, you could use a light application of this cream to create an instant suntanned look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they include a potentially harmful ingredient in this otherwise lovely product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I really like this BB cream!</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s GMO free, gluten-free, paraben-free, and all natural.</li>
            <li> all natural, which is most important to me, especially when it works as well as synthetic ingredients, without the associated harm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, but it offers the light amount of coverage I am looking for.</li>
            <li> it seems to have good ingredients, absorbs well after the first few minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It is not completely sheer, but would probably blend well over most medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy</li>
            <li> It sooths the constant redness and burning that I have and the tint in it helps neutralize most of the redness.</li>
            <li> Although this only has zinc and not titanium dioxide as the SPF, I still apply powder with titanium dioxide and my makeup does go on much better after I put this beauty balm on.  </li>
            <li> I guess I just didn&#x27;t realize this was more makeup than facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and not only does it protect my skin from the sun it moisturizes it well.</li>
            <li> when first applied, it leaves a satin finish without looking greasy, but after about 30 minutes it darkens quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and looks more even, but it definitely gave my skin an orange tint.</li>
            <li> I had heard about \\&quot;BB\\&quot; creams, but didn&#x27;t know exactly what they were.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a beauty balm that was cruelty free and natural.</li>
            <li> appreciate a company that is trying to do the right thing in terms of the ingredients it&#x27;s using, and really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I also have a fair amount of old sun damage and rough patches.</li>
            <li> , it has hyaluronic acid which i love the most but its kinda thick and just found out that theres an alcohol in it</li>
            <li> I have other Andalou products and have found them to be gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a daily sunblock and this one had a high rating from the EWG&#x27;s Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight tint which blends nicely.</li>
            <li> and I have a strong tan and use yellow based foundations.</li>
            <li> I am around some chemically sensitive people and they tell me they can smell when I have this product on, smells like grapefruit (not unpleasant to me.)</li>
            <li> It;s nice and dewy but then also feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the physical sun protection in this, but with light skin this oxidizes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> However, this product is very sticky and the stickiness does not go away with time, your face stays sticky the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Liking this really took me by surprise.</li>
            <li> really like this cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sold at Whole Foods, so try and get a sample of it from Whole Foods to try on your skin, and let it sit all day before deciding to buy,</li>
            <li> Takes a bit more rubbing than non mineral sunscreens but not much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream and will be using again.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and the coverage of this product as well as the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It was very hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this...</li>
            <li> Powdering the T-Zone is something I also do when wearing this because it gives a very dewy finished.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel when its on my face and in winter i&#x27;ll use the untinted one With or without foundation</li>
            <li> I like it that much.</li>
            <li> The color is too much for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t cover that much.</li>
            <li> the tint is a light to med, yellow- peachy shade.  </li>
            <li> It really is a bit orange</li>
            <li> and he is very perceptive to these things.</li>
            <li> VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> (it dries fast)</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It is also very oily and bought my out in pimples.</li>
            <li> I always have it at the ready.</li>
            <li> However, it has a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell that stays with me all day.  </li>
            <li> applying it, this BB cream leaves my face very oily and shinning.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it because I like the whole line</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But, I put it on and blended it in really well, and I had no noticeable orange tint on my face.</li>
            <li> and I get to use my housemate&#x27;s discount, which makes it very affordable,</li>
            <li> Dont have to use much.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they are using to much.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much happier.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try anything on my skin, as I didn&#x27;t want anything to aggravate my dermatitis (mostly contained to my chin area), yet this product caught my eye at my local natural health store.  </li>
            <li> I know the description says &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34;, but other &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; bb creams gives you just a very light sheen coverage.  </li>
            <li> Next time I think I&#x27;ll order their other 1000 Roses cream as it seems to have more actual coverage and omits the orange oil (can be photosensitizing) in favor of rose.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell, but it is so strong and lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to it being a top BB cream on EWG.ORG.</li>
            <li> I should have taken more notice of other reviews.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than most moisturizers packaged in a tube due to the minerals</li>
            <li> And rather than a yellow tone, it&#x27;s more reddish/orangish which is not fitting for most skin tones.  </li>
            <li> this tint is very light and will not cover dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I also have a lot of sun damage with dark age spots, and this seems to be helping make my skin tone look better.  </li>
            <li> I need more concealer for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the full price ($21.99) as I got it for around $12 bucks and the full price seems a little high to me.  </li>
            <li> Andalou could make the color more universally flattering by taking a tip from the mineral makeup industry: adding a hint of ultramarine blue to create a truly neutral color.  </li>
            <li> The cream covered some of my freckles, so the coverage seems decent.</li>
            <li> I tested this and the other BB SPFs from Andalou while at Lucky&#x27;s, and found this one to be just the right amount of creamy and hydrating for me.</li>
            <li> It looks good on my pale irish skin.</li>
            <li> also highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product and was highly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is all natural and pure.</li>
            <li> The tone is definitely a peachy one that gives a hint of color even though this really pretty much has zero coverage.</li>
            <li> I love that it uses zinc as the sunscreen rather than harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I suspect a lot of this is caused by the sea buckthorn oil present in this along with the orange essential, which this BB cream smells strongly of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutral: It has a natural citrus scent which I really like; however, it might bother folks that are very sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use alot of other andalou products which has helped my skin become supple and acne free.</li>
            <li> I mentioned I was looking for a new foundation with SPF that was non-toxic, and</li>
            <li> We live in the mountains and this saves my skin all year.</li>
            <li> Over the month or so that I used it, it was feeling harder and harder to get my face clean, and I often used an exfoliator just to feel my familiar skin texture again.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle fruity smell as well.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to provide good coverage and provides sun protection.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to a lot of products that claim to be hypoallergenic, and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> It just gave me a very natural, healthy-looking</li>
            <li> i never break out with it on, though, and i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even many (if not most)</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and  I&#x27;m almost done with my first tube which I purchased two months ago.</li>
            <li> Start with a small quantity and apply more as you need it.  </li>
            <li> At first the product looks slightly orange-yellow, but after a few minutes it looks like my own skin color.</li>
            <li> really like this bb cream, which unlike many recent bb entries, actually has ingredients that actively do something for the skin beyond cosmetic effect.  </li>
            <li> Great SPF and works well with my dry skin even though I may need a little extra moisture underneath in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the Bare Minerals CC cream for</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; conceal as much as my other BB cream, and it does have a mild orange tint to it</li>
            <li> I would order again but maybe a clear one from the range for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my semi-dry sensitive Asian skin.  </li>
            <li> but I am much happier with the Physicians Formula BB Cream I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> This cream will only match very warm-tone completions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I does provide sun protection, it is all natural &amp; it works well under my makeup</li>
            <li> Seconds after applying my eyes begin to burn and water even if I don&#x27;t use it near my eye area.</li>
            <li> It is very sheer and does not provide much coverage over blemishes, etc.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very dewy finish and makes your skin look healthier instantly.</li>
            <li> I may try the Andalou Naturals BB Skin Perfecting Beauty Balm SPF 30 Natural instead...</li>
            <li> As the package indicates, it is sheer, so dont expect much coverage.  </li>
            <li> keep looking for a natural cleanser that takes this stuff off.</li>
            <li> Really though, I like it well enough.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural sunscreen for the summer that won&#x27;t break out your skin, but gives you that sunkissed glow</li>
            <li> it gives a sheer coverage, blending out skin tone and really does liven up skin without looking made up.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product as my daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I had used to buy facial sunscreen that was SPF30, free of chemicals but a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I frequently get asked about it since I often wear it instead of makeup.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far seems just like the others have said.</li>
            <li> So I try not to apply it so much near my nose.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and even toned.  </li>
            <li> My acne is completely gone</li>
            <li> I wear this alone with eye concealer and a bit of blush for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product as I&#x27;m on my second tube.  </li>
            <li> Offers light coverage without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> This was a full shade too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and with the summer heat in the 100s I was looking for a natural teneted beauty balm with high spf as I am a red head.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two days and have not broken out (this usually happens quickly) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive, light, Irish skin, and I refuse to use products that have parabens and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few BB creams before that were decent, but this, I really give all thumbs up (should add a few hands for more thumbs).  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I like a natural product like this that gives me high enough SPF and all natural ingredient</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s also not for people with any serious skin issues they want to cover, unless they want to keep piling on more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend trying it if you are a conscientious cosmetics user looking for a decent BB.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian, medium light, with a slight yellow undertone, but with ruddy (reddish) cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give you a lot of coverage compared to normal makeup, but it is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I apply my normal moisturizer prior to applying the BB.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the color might be too dark because I have a fair complexion, but it is summer right now and the color blends into my skin for a very natural look.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little on the thick side so doesn&#x27;t apply super easily</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d love to see a lighter color or something a little less &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; it seems to look natural (I think!)</li>
            <li> It has a sheer tan tint, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m still giving it such a high review, though, is because it has everything that I would like in such a product, coverage, spf, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> However I have mature skin ands use natural oils as my moisturizing routine, and Bare Essentials powder as my daily makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter that usually causes my makeup to cake and flake, but this really helps my dry skin to be more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like I barely have any coverage and still need some concealer.</li>
            <li> Finally found a bb cream that has it all - brightening, a touch of coverage, moisture, natural ingredients and spf.</li>
            <li> looks super too dark at first, but does blend in well with my winter pale yellow toned skin,</li>
            <li> I do like the way it feels...its light and not too greasy, and it spreads well over your entire face so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If it were just slightly mattifying and had no SPF I would love this, but not as is and not really even with mixing with other lotion.</li>
            <li> The only real concern I had from other reviewers was the color match.  </li>
            <li> Also not a long term solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> it feels a bit heavy at first, dare i say,even oily, and it is a bit shiny, but settles on skin after 30min or so.</li>
            <li> the jury&#x27;s still out on whether i&#x27;ll get it again - going to try a few others first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale with freckles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd, because it squirts out of the bottle looking very opaque, but then it goes on</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that is slightly sensitive, I was worried that the citrus in this creme would bother my skin but irritation did not occur at all.</li>
            <li> 20% zinc oxide sun filtration, fruit stem cells, vit c, hyaluronic acid and a host of anti-oxidants in meaningful concentrations, not just tacked on the end of a long list of cheap ingredients, in a base formula with aloe and jojoba.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I really did not find that it concealed any redness but the peachy undertone does mask any white cast that zinc oxcide can typically give.</li>
            <li> : It is a little pricey but, given the ingredients, I think it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> But, a little concealer, mascara, and lip gloss, and I would be ready to go out on the town.  </li>
            <li> Not so much so that I can&#x27;t leave the house wearing it, but for truly pale gals out there, this would definitely be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried other products in my quest for the illusion of clear skin.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m surprised the color is as dark as it is.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit thick at first and I can feel it on my face, but it seems to absorb after a while.</li>
            <li> I think  it made me breakout a little bit, but that could&#x27;ve been my skin reacting to the new product as I had never used it before.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry and flakey, red and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Without oil it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for my dry</li>
            <li> I am very pale and the color was very orange on me.</li>
            <li> I fully realize that a natural sunscreen is never going to be as fun or easy as the nasty chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a history of skin cancer and the natural products without chemical sunscreens have been my major purchases lately.  </li>
            <li> It was lightly moisturizing without adding to my usual late in the day oiliness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: since I haven&#x27;t found anything better (Juice Beauty is too expensive, Physician&#x27;s Formula is too dark)</li>
            <li> This has very sheer coverage when applied with a wet sponge.</li>
            <li> The sheen is not natural looking.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure it&#x27;s a problem yet, but I used three face washes and still when I scraped a nail lightly against my skin a thick film of this stuff came off.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product to use as a sunscreen/tinted moisturizer and while I haven&#x27;t tried that many, I was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide is a physical sunblock that does not have health concerns like some chemical filters in other products.</li>
            <li> i wore it for a week daily with no breakouts or other issues.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers said that this product left your skin orange looking though, but I bought it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry, fair/medium skin with cool-neutral undertones.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, medium tone and reddish cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing for my desperately dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can use this, let it dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out nor dry me out.  </li>
            <li> I tried to come back to it a few times same reaction.</li>
            <li> The spf is high but the cream isn&#x27;t thick like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle tint, not great for covering up much but moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li> But for lighter skin tones, anyone with oiliness or dark spots, this product is not enough.</li>
            <li> It looked okay on but very difficult to get off, even with oil cleansing method.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the non tinted version of this - a blue label - and prefer it hands down.</li>
            <li> It is not high in coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a slightly olive complexion, and this sheer tint blended in well with my skin.</li>
            <li> it is just too oily for me, even half and hour later.</li>
            <li> AND, in the winter, my skin needs extra moisture and powder over moisturizer leaves a cakey mess.  </li>
            <li> The tint is not sheer; it has an obvious orange cast that stood out on my wrist (which is very pale and neutral toned).</li>
            <li> It is actually very sheer, with little coverage.  </li>
            <li> (that is why the little red patches beside my nose are so noticeable).  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a sheer tint - its a little orangey looking.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (I am a rather pale, fair-skinned South Asian, looking for a little extra color and moisture).  </li>
            <li> Still giving 4 stars for the great ingredient list and omission of nasty chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but it is darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It provides some coverage but not like a heavy foundation only product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for just a moisturizer with spf, this stuff is HEAVY and it&#x27;s essentially foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her skin is so sensitive she is unable to get her eyebrows waxed because it turns her skin red for days and swells up (she shaves them daily)</li>
            <li> Its thick but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fake-tanner-accident orange, but it&#x27;s certainly not natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On other people who were pale with a yellow undertone to their skin (they have the ability to tan)</li>
            <li> I have been using Juice Beauty for the past two years, and this BB cream is quite similar to their CC cream (only half the price!).</li>
            <li> As per other reviews, yes, this has a yellowish tint.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for the texture.  </li>
            <li> If the other skin benefits mentioned by other reviewers occur in the coming weeks, I will be ecstatic.</li>
            <li> That could be due to my skin tone</li>
            <li> The color was a little orangey as others mentioned and the coverage is minimal.</li>
            <li> enjoy the smell of this product, but applying it is almost painful.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros.</li>
            <li> It would doubtless work well if the user had a bit of sun but might be too dark for some people.</li>
            <li> The parts of my skin that were already clear looked \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; with the Fairie Organics mineral make-up, but the dermatitis on my chin area looked \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; after applying both the mineral make-up and the mineral concealer, and I believe that this make-up made the dermatitis worse.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick, but creamy, and sheer moisturizer/sunblock.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it came in a slightly darker tint for my darker olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to put makeup on afterwards, you really need to wait a little</li>
            <li> but it makes the blotches less</li>
            <li> No stinging, or odd odor.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly oily but not so oily that I needed to buy their oily skin BB.</li>
            <li> It covers the flaws on my skin and allows me to wear less make-up.  </li>
            <li> Application is very difficult as it is thick and doesn&#x27;t apply easily.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that it would not be a proper match for someone who is not anglo saxon, and this hardly leaves the product matching the majority of skin types!</li>
            <li> though by letting it soak in a few minitwa than dabbing my face slightly with a towel to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li> I was worried about my face breaking out or getting oily, but it is actually a little drying.</li>
            <li> The problem was it came out a little too orange on me.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll expound a little.</li>
            <li> I use it as my make up with just a little powder over it.</li>
            <li> All that I have to do is apply a little mascara</li>
            <li> (Otherwise, it looks a little orange.)</li>
            <li> I gave the creme a 4 instead of a five because it is a little bit heavy</li>
            <li> A little to heavy and cakey for me.</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin tone as very average caucasian.  </li>
            <li> The texture was another thing, though, very thick and almost feeling like there were tiny bits of grit.</li>
            <li> I have to apply mineral powder foundation to bring down the shine and to cover my sun spots because this BB cream gives you very little coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have been out in heavy sun</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to wear, expecially in the hotter climates.</li>
            <li> My go to everyday make-up.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy and still provided protection from the salt air, sun and wind.  </li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients, nothing sinister in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> that I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> After applying it, I felt as if my skin had a heavy layer on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews stating that this has an orange tint to it - it is &amp;#34;orange-ish&amp;#34; when coming out of the tube</li>
            <li> adds a bit of sunny glow effect, like a pale bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I am PALE.</li>
            <li> It made my hair stick to my face, and made my bangs feel greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> but the application is not easy because of its thickness.</li>
            <li> but it is annoying to smell it all day long and anyone sensitive to smells will probably not enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li> really too bad</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will re-purchase this.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what could ingredient is the culprit but just wanted to let others know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others are complaining about that since coverage is not what this product claims to do.  </li>
            <li> I  usually powder as well.</li>
            <li> By doing this it doesnt allow the product to remain heavy or thick on my skin.</li>
            <li> Looking for a tinted moisturizer without silicones was difficult but then I stumbled on Andalou Naturals and noticed they have a BB cream or essentially a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Be it in natural lighting or harsh artificial lighting, this stuff does not look cakey and at least on me, it does not look orange.  </li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Ultra-sheer in the past, before going organic with my skin care products, I noticed that the Neutrogena sunscreen produced irritation/bumpy skin after use.  </li>
            <li> To put things into perspective my options for a sunblock let alone any sort of base (BB, CC creams, foundation) have been limited thanks to my skin being unable to tolerate dimethicone, fragrance, any sort of petroleum based additives or chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Berry Complex*, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Hyaluronic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Cucumis Sativus</li>
            <li> not so much a negative reflection on the product itself.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a muddy thick feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and creamy from the tube, but sheers off when applied.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream - the consistency of toothpaste</li>
            <li> no rash, itching, or other ill effects.  </li>
            <li> and my shoulders did not fair too well</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> skin is pale and it the picture makes it look like it would be alright, but this made my face look orange like a fake tan.</li>
            <li> Tough.</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sorry, but the 1000 Roses BB Cream almost knocked me off my feet).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s got questionable ingredients in it so.....</li>
            <li> in all it feels like my face is suffocating.</li>
            <li> I have other tinted spf and the smell is horrible and it stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is like a really bad orange fake tan.</li>
            <li> Now it wasn&#x27;t bad to begin with, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything.</li>
            <li> It made me look like I had a bad spray tan.</li>
            <li> it clogged my pores very badly and caused breakouts, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It is too orange for me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I searched for a BB cream that wasn&#x27;t loaded with nasty chemicals and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is a really awful Orange colour on my skin</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros. What I did like was the ingredient list and the orange smell. However, this product is very sticky and the stickiness does not go away with time, your face stays sticky the rest of the day. I was using it with powder over it and it got gunk all over my brushes. The color was a little orangey as others mentioned and the coverage is minimal. I don&#x27;t hate it but I am much happier with the Physicians Formula BB Cream I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> This cream will only match very warm-tone completions. This is because iron oxide is the only pigment in the cream. Andalou could make the color more universally flattering by taking a tip from the mineral makeup industry: adding a hint of ultramarine blue to create a truly neutral color.  If your complexion is neutral or cool tone, you could use a light application of this cream to create an instant suntanned look.  This cream gives a dewy finish with good hydration. You can also achieve a matte look with translucent powder.  The list of ingredients is excellent, so although the color didn&#x27;t work for me, I am now using the Andalou untinted bb-cream. But I would buy their tinted version if it were available in a neutral tone.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was like a make up.  Does go on well, but don&#x27;t like any color because it gets on my clothes.  will use up anyway.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and the color is just sheer enough to make it seem like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup! I have oily skin so I have to wear powder on top of this, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love how this product looks on my skin, but it contains citrus oil (orange), which studies show makes the skin more prone to sun damage (wrinkles, spots).  It&#x27;s a shame they include a potentially harmful ingredient in this otherwise lovely product.</li>
            <li> Liking this really took me by surprise. I wanted a light organic foundation to wear on days I didn&#x27;t feel like makeup. The cool thing is you can wear this alone or under makeup. By itself it brightens your look and is a non-cancer-causing SPF. Under makeup, it seems to protect the skin. But the very best thing is that my skin looks better now with nothing on it. All the redness is gone in just a few days, the pore size diminished, and my skin looks and feels great. Now it wasn&#x27;t bad to begin with, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything. I think it&#x27;s the zinc oxide that heals, and there&#x27;s nothing that hurts.</li>
            <li> Smells slightly of citrus--very pleasant. Similar to the BB cream that I use from Korea, but it sits more lightly on the skin and feels more breathable.  Oh--and, I actually know the ingredients of this one. It won&#x27;t give you a lot of coverage compared to normal makeup, but it is enough for me.</li>
            <li> This cream gives you some coverage that I was not expecting. It;s nice and dewy but then also feels a little greasy. It makes it difficult to put makeup on afterwards, you really need to wait a little but. I think  it made me breakout a little bit, but that could&#x27;ve been my skin reacting to the new product as I had never used it before.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have dry, fair/medium skin with cool-neutral undertones. I was hoping this BB cream could cover up my hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This BB cream has everything I need! The zinc oxide is a physical sunblock that does not have health concerns like some chemical filters in other products. The hyaluronic acid quenches my thirsty skin and the variety of vitamins and antioxidants helps promote healthy skin. It has none of the ingredients that I am trying to avoid (e.g. parabens) and gets a low hazard score (1) from the EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep). The rich cream goes on very smoothly and evenly, giving me a healthy glow. Coverage is sheer (similar to a tinted moisturizer) after proper blending. Please note that blending is essential!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: It has a natural citrus scent which I really like; however, it might bother folks that are very sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is a little pricey but, given the ingredients, I think it is reasonably priced. It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hyperpigmentation (I didn&#x27;t expect that it would) but it makes the blotches less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I really like this BB cream! I has everything I want (and none of what I don&#x27;t) and leaves my skin looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have dry skin, medium tone and reddish cheeks. This non-toxic make up makes my skin shiny (which I prefer to matte) and bright. It&#x27;s my fave! I love the smell too. It evens out my tone and leaves me feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance on this.  I had  another product that was triple the price and the color was orange.  This gives a nice color and leaves you with a very dewy look.  It also gives good protection.  I have been out in heavy sun and my shoulders did not fair too well but my face was fine.  My complexion is fair but has some red in it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff . Great moisturizer &amp; good for when you just want light makeup. Or great under other makeup.</li>
            <li> This natural sunscreen product goes on smoothly, has a great feeling, and provides a touch of coverage that&#x27;s totally natural looking. I recommend it heartily!</li>
            <li> It leaves a muddy thick feeling on your skin. Not comfortable to wear, expecially in the hotter climates. And the tint stains my clothes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will re-purchase this. It is very thick. I does provide sun protection, it is all natural &amp; it works well under my makeup but the application is not easy because of its thickness.</li>
            <li> I first want to say I love the coverage this gives and the healthy glow it gives me. But, it burns my eyes! Seconds after applying my eyes begin to burn and water even if I don&#x27;t use it near my eye area. I am not sure what could ingredient is the culprit but just wanted to let others know.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it has a low toxicity rating on the environmental working groups website. I love BB creams, and I am trying to switch all of my beauty products to natural/toxic free.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this cream. It smells amazing. It goes on very smooth, with no caking or clumps. It is very sheer and does not provide much coverage over blemishes, etc. So, if you are looking for more coverage, you might want to use this under foundation or as a base/moisturizer. It does, however make your skin appear more even and smooth. I am very happy with this BB cream and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tinted mineral sunscreen. This is all natural and pure. I am 60 and have a fair medium Northern European complexion. At first the product looks slightly orange-yellow, but after a few minutes it looks like my own skin color. It also evens out skin tone (redness), and is great alone or as a mineral makeup primer. It doesn&#x27;t feel as drying or itchy as some products feel at the end of the day. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> i like this it has nice smell</li>
            <li> I know the description says &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34;, but other &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; bb creams gives you just a very light sheen coverage.  This gives you no coverage at all.  zero.  But at least it&#x27;s pleasant smelling and (hopefully) good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this new BB cream. It makes my skin look and feel great. Plus it has a great orange scent. I was afraid that the color might be too dark because I have a fair complexion, but it is summer right now and the color blends into my skin for a very natural look. I will buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li> My go to everyday make-up.</li>
            <li> This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for:  highly organic/non-toxic (gets great reviews on the EWG cosmetics database), and just the right color to darken my skin tone slightly.  Perfect for aging skin that needs extra moisture.  I realize it may not match everyone&#x27;s skin tone perfectly, so perhaps I got lucky (I am a rather pale, fair-skinned South Asian, looking for a little extra color and moisture).  But I am a huge fan of this product. Here&#x27;s a tip:  it&#x27;s sold at Whole Foods, so try and get a sample of it from Whole Foods to try on your skin, and let it sit all day before deciding to buy, which is what I did.</li>
            <li> I like that it is tinted and easily blends in with my skin tone.  Takes a bit more rubbing than non mineral sunscreens but not much.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! By far the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. My skin is important to me, and this product instantly makes my skin look and feel better. I bought this product due to it being a top BB cream on EWG.ORG. I do have sensitive, light, Irish skin, and I refuse to use products that have parabens and other harmful ingredients. I do have a yellow undertone with very red cheeks (almost like rosacea) this is enough coverage everywhere except my cheeks. I use it as a primer that works perfectly in conjunction with my dermablend makeup. Seriously my skin has never looked and felt this good!</li>
            <li> This natural BB is moisturizing and smells like yummy oranges,the color is sheer but its best for light to medium skin tones.Goes on easy and feels  soft on my skin.Best for people with dry skin,may be too much moisture for those with oily skin types. Wish they would makes lighter and darker tints.Overall I would get this again,as it got a 1 on the EWG ratings.</li>
            <li> It is always a risk ordering products without a sample. This BB is a perfect match for my fair complexion (with red undertones.) It is thick enough to provide good coverage and provides sun protection. A winner in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> To Orange tinted for my skin tone. It made me look like I had a bad spray tan. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream and will be using again. It leaves a very dewy finish and makes your skin look healthier instantly. The spf is high but the cream isn&#x27;t thick like sunscreen. I used to use a moisturizer before, for example, with a lower spf that didn&#x27;t blend well and left white streaks. I like that it&#x27;s GMO free, gluten-free, paraben-free, and all natural. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges easily and is kind of sticky on your skin. The reason I&#x27;m still giving it such a high review, though, is because it has everything that I would like in such a product, coverage, spf, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using Juice Beauty for the past two years, and this BB cream is quite similar to their CC cream (only half the price!). I haven&#x27;t been using this one long, but so far so good! I tested this and the other BB SPFs from Andalou while at Lucky&#x27;s, and found this one to be just the right amount of creamy and hydrating for me. didn&#x27;t take forever to blend in, didn&#x27;t leave a white cast, and didn&#x27;t overpower me with smell (I&#x27;m sorry, but the 1000 Roses BB Cream almost knocked me off my feet). I apply with a makeup sponge, because I just don&#x27;t like to rub makeup into my face with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a slightly olive complexion, and this sheer tint blended in well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and the coverage of this product as well as the ingredients. I searched for a BB cream that wasn&#x27;t loaded with nasty chemicals and decided to give this a try. I was also hoping for something that was more luminous than a matte coverage so if you&#x27;re looking for something more matte (and drying in my opinion) this might not be for you. Goes on great, smells pretty good and gives me sun coverage which I love. I actually think it&#x27;s helped my complexion which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I&#x27;d love to see a lighter color or something a little less &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; it seems to look natural (I think!) but when I wipe my face I see the tint on my hands. Overall very happy so far!</li>
            <li> The tinted color blends in quite nicely. I feel like I have good protection from the sun and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This product is not for very fair skin. My skin is too fair for the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade of most tinted moisturizers, and \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; or \\&quot;alabaster\\&quot; is more likely to be right for me than \\&quot;ivory\\&quot;. This product turned orange. It isn&#x27;t fake-tanner-accident orange, but it&#x27;s certainly not natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars because it probably works fine for people with light or medium skin tone, and its other features were good. It was very hypoallergenic. I am very sensitive to a lot of products that claim to be hypoallergenic, and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. It was lightly moisturizing without adding to my usual late in the day oiliness. I did not test out how well it works as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have other tinted spf and the smell is horrible and it stings my eyes. The smell with this is fresh orange and the texture is creamy. Great protection and slight color. I am all about the multi purpose products and this is one of my favorites. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This has a light feel but covers/evens skin tone--It blends in easily. all natural, which is most important to me, especially when it works as well as synthetic ingredients, without the associated harm. It is also a 30SPA sunscreen--great product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the sun protection. It goes on a bit thick at first and I can feel it on my face, but it seems to absorb after a while. I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, but it offers the light amount of coverage I am looking for. I was worried about my face breaking out or getting oily, but it is actually a little drying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in Florida.  It worked wonderful.  It wasn&#x27;t heavy and still provided protection from the salt air, sun and wind.  I use all Andalou products and am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this... it seems to have good ingredients, absorbs well after the first few minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. The problem is the color. I am very pale and the color was very orange on me. I may try the Andalou Naturals BB Skin Perfecting Beauty Balm SPF 30 Natural instead...</li>
            <li> After someone with absolutely gorgeous skin recommended this I was so happy to find it here and immediately bought it when I read the ingredients. Specifically that it is silicone or more importantly dimethicone free and zinc based with an SPF of 30. To put things into perspective my options for a sunblock let alone any sort of base (BB, CC creams, foundation) have been limited thanks to my skin being unable to tolerate dimethicone, fragrance, any sort of petroleum based additives or chemical sunscreens. Even many (if not most) more natural sunblocks contain dimethicone to give it slip and make it easier to blend in.  Even without dimethicone this has a really nice feel to it that I find very easy to spread over my skin. The tone is definitely a peachy one that gives a hint of color even though this really pretty much has zero coverage. I really did not find that it concealed any redness but the peachy undertone does mask any white cast that zinc oxcide can typically give. I suspect a lot of this is caused by the sea buckthorn oil present in this along with the orange essential, which this BB cream smells strongly of. Powdering the T-Zone is something I also do when wearing this because it gives a very dewy finished.  Next time I think I&#x27;ll order their other 1000 Roses cream as it seems to have more actual coverage and omits the orange oil (can be photosensitizing) in favor of rose. So, so happy I was introduced to Andalou Naturals and that I finally have a decent, non-irritating zink based sunblock to wear this year.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, but creamy, and sheer moisturizer/sunblock.  I wanted a sunscreen for my face with zinc oxide, but didnt want that white, shiny, pasty look.  This fit the bill, plus gives me a touch of color and matt finish.  As the package indicates, it is sheer, so dont expect much coverage.  I&#x27;m not sure why others are complaining about that since coverage is not what this product claims to do.  When I want additional coverage, I put foundation on top for a flawless finish.  I really like the feel when its on my face and in winter i&#x27;ll use the untinted one With or without foundation I like it that much.</li>
            <li> As per other reviews, yes, this has a yellowish tint. It happens to work ok with my skin tone, brightening it a bit. It is not high in coverage so I feel like it&#x27;s fairly versatile for most skin, unless any yellow is a no- go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a couple days. The feel of it has been just fine. For me. However I have mature skin ands use natural oils as my moisturizing routine, and Bare Essentials powder as my daily makeup. That&#x27;s not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is in taking it off at night. Tough. I am really committed to finding a good sunscreen so I am not sure it&#x27;s a problem yet, but I used three face washes and still when I scraped a nail lightly against my skin a thick film of this stuff came off. An oil based cleanser worked ok but it&#x27;s got questionable ingredients in it so..... Also not a long term solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep looking for a natural cleanser that takes this stuff off. Really though, I like it well enough. I fully realize that a natural sunscreen is never going to be as fun or easy as the nasty chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> The color is too much for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is perfect for people with a brown hue, which is amazing to find. it blends in and for the most part, this is all you need</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Andalou, and was excited to try this out.  I&#x27;ve tried a few BB creams before that were decent, but this, I really give all thumbs up (should add a few hands for more thumbs).  The only real concern I had from other reviewers was the color match.  This is invisible on my skin, and similar to a perfect sheer foundation.  Very natural looking.  I would describe my skin tone as very average caucasian.  Not tan, but not china doll white.  Great, great product!</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good product if compared to other &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; cosmetics, which too often fall short on performance. My only complaints are that it is not waterproof (will run if you sweat), and it sometimes takes some effort to get it to absorb and blend well. I have to wear a mineral powder over it to prevent shine. But it feels good on, it has a decent SPF, and it has not caused any breakouts or itching for my sensitive skin. I have a medium-tan complexion (see Iredale&#x27;s Golden Glow), and this appears a shade too light until I apply powder. It is not completely sheer, but would probably blend well over most medium skin tones. Overall, I would recommend trying it if you are a conscientious cosmetics user looking for a decent BB.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has such great, natural ingredients, as well as SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant citrus smell (it is a bit weird to be smearing your face in something that smells like you should eat it, but I kind of like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, this is not the best product for two reasons: It&#x27;s too moisturizing and the color is a bit orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, not terrifically oily, so maybe this would be good for very dry-skinned people. But on me, I feel there&#x27;s no way I can leave the house without dabbing powder on my face as well, and that kind of defeats the natural, breathable perks of a BB cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m surprised the color is as dark as it is. I&#x27;m not exactly porcelain fair, though I guess I&#x27;m rather light, and it&#x27;s still a shade orange for me. Not so much so that I can&#x27;t leave the house wearing it, but for truly pale gals out there, this would definitely be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t cover that much. It&#x27;s odd, because it squirts out of the bottle looking very opaque, but then it goes on and I feel like I barely have any coverage and still need some concealer. So it&#x27;s also not for people with any serious skin issues they want to cover, unless they want to keep piling on more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a good rating because, like I said, I&#x27;m sure it would probably be great for a medium-skinned gal with dryness and no acne scars, dark circles, hyperpigmentation, etc. But for lighter skin tones, anyone with oiliness or dark spots, this product is not enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the reviews. I live in Texas and with the summer heat in the 100s I was looking for a natural teneted beauty balm with high spf as I am a red head. I have sensitive, dry skin. I wear clinique even better make up color &amp;#34;linen&amp;#34; which is even lighter then alabaster. This product came out very sheer so you don&#x27;t feel greesy or like you are wearing sunscreen. I love the smell, it smells like oranges. This did not break out my skin or cause any reactions. The problem was it came out a little too orange on me. On other people who were pale with a yellow undertone to their skin (they have the ability to tan) it looked great like a glow of lightly bronzed sun kissed skin. There is no coverage at all so it will not cover up any skin concerns or coloring. If you are looking for a natural sunscreen for the summer that won&#x27;t break out your skin, but gives you that sunkissed glow and you have a yellow under tone to your skin this is a great product. It is too orange for me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> stay away if you have fair skin, unless you like looking like an orange oompa loompa.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! I&#x27;d like to try the rose one. But I keep defaulting to the tried and true version I am familiar with. Great protection. Very light coverage. I  usually powder as well.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling and lovely light scent.  Goes on smooth and looks nice.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out. I loved how it looked and felt, but it didn&#x27;t work with my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t react with my skin, love that it has spf but it is darker than I expected. I would order again but maybe a clear one from the range for oily skin. Like the natural ingredients, nothing sinister in the ingredient list. I&#x27;m pretty fussy and I do like this range a lot.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a girlfriend who avoids toxic products.  I mentioned I was looking for a new foundation with SPF that was non-toxic, and voila!  This product goes on smoothly and lasts, it does not leave those lines where you don&#x27;t quite smooth the foundation on the edges of your face.  It provides some coverage but not like a heavy foundation only product.  It does smell a bit strong is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  I am around some chemically sensitive people and they tell me they can smell when I have this product on, smells like grapefruit (not unpleasant to me.)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product to use as a sunscreen/tinted moisturizer and while I haven&#x27;t tried that many, I was disappointed in this one. It has a shine to it which I don&#x27;t mind but what I do mind is that the sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t go away for quite awhile. It made my hair stick to my face, and made my bangs feel greasy and stiff. It does have a pleasant smell, and LOOKS ok, but i couldn&#x27;t get used to the feel. Doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> why?  20% zinc oxide sun filtration, fruit stem cells, vit c, hyaluronic acid and a host of anti-oxidants in meaningful concentrations, not just tacked on the end of a long list of cheap ingredients, in a base formula with aloe and jojoba.&lt;br /&gt;i really like this bb cream, which unlike many recent bb entries, actually has ingredients that actively do something for the skin beyond cosmetic effect.  the tint is a light to med, yellow- peachy shade.  looks super too dark at first, but does blend in well with my winter pale yellow toned skin, adds a bit of sunny glow effect, like a pale bronzer.  it feels a bit heavy at first, dare i say,even oily, and it is a bit shiny, but settles on skin after 30min or so. if you have drier skin, i think this would be perfect for you. i can skip a moisturizer and/or treatment serum below, because everything i need is in this one product.  it can be powdered over, but i am very sensitive to too many layers on my skin, so prefer not to powder. i wore it for a week daily with no breakouts or other issues.  it gives a sheer coverage, blending out skin tone and really does liven up skin without looking made up.  the price point for this product is outstanding for what it offers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Juice*, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) and Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oils*, Sorbitan Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Fruit Stem Cell and BioActive 8 Berry Complex*, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Hyaluronic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract*, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Oil*, Algae and Cucumis Melo (Melon) Extracts, Magnesium Sulfate, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos), Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis and Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Extracts*†, Iron Oxide, Phenethyl Alcohol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil*</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have dry skin that is slightly sensitive, I was worried that the citrus in this creme would bother my skin but irritation did not occur at all. I use alot of other andalou products which has helped my skin become supple and acne free. Because of this I do no need a full coverage foundation.  This bb creme works out very nicely as it is a very sheer coverage and just makes your skin radiant with even tones. I have fairly light skin and I do not have any issues with an orange tint, I believe this is because I dont need the product to conceal.  If you have light skin toned that needs a fuller coverage this product may not be for you, as the more you use the more orange it will become, im sure.  I gave the creme a 4 instead of a five because it is a little bit heavy, I correct that though by letting it soak in a few minitwa than dabbing my face slightly with a towel to remove excess moisture. By doing this it doesnt allow the product to remain heavy or thick on my skin. After blotting the excess off I have no issues with oil for the remainder of the day.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to use it in the future myself.  I would compare it to estee lauders bb cream. Nicely done andalou!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it evens out skin tone without needing any foundation</li>
            <li> It is amazing. That&#x27;s all that needs to be said. But I&#x27;ll expound a little. I have horribly dry and flakey, red and irritated skin. Everything irritates it...except for this moisturizer. It sooths the constant redness and burning that I have and the tint in it helps neutralize most of the redness. It also does not cling to any flakes. I was amazed by that. I have never found anything with a tint that didn&#x27;t immediately make my flakey skin more pronounced. It&#x27;s so moisturizing for my desperately dry skin. The only downside I can think of is that the color almost doesn&#x27;t work for me. It really is a bit orange but I can make it work so it&#x27;s not enough to deter me from using it. I&#x27;m almost through with this tube so I decided I wanted to try the 1000 roses version since I LOVE rose water and anything rose for the face. I&#x27;ll post a review on that too. I hope this works for others as it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients. Smells good. Tint blends well and leaves a nice coverage. Moisturizes well. I have oily skin and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was too greasy. On humid days I&#x27;ll just dab a bit of powder if needed. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ORANGE!!! My face remains blotchy with orange. My boyfriend even noticed this and he is very perceptive to these things. He said &amp;#34;your face is a different color than your neck&amp;#34;. VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> Over all for me: The color is great. Good sunscreen level. The smell is great (minimal and orangey-fruity from the stem cells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is just too oily for me, even half and hour later. I am Caucasian, medium light, with a slight yellow undertone, but with ruddy (reddish) cheeks and nose. I also have a fair amount of old sun damage and rough patches. This tint is slightly yellow, so it works great for my skin color, but it&#x27;s just too slippery for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend the [[ASIN:B0052P0XBO Andalou Naturals Ultra Sheer SPF 18 Daily Defense Facial Lotion, 2.7 Ounce]] Totally non-oily and very nice. I can use this, let it dry (it dries fast) then just put some liquid make-up over it. Voila! Works great. I also highly recommend the Bare Minerals CC cream for it&#x27;s all-in-one sunscreen and coverage. http://www.amazon.com/Bare-Complexion-Hydrating-Buttercream-Escentuals/dp/B00S5643SQ/ref&#x3D;pd_rhf_dp_p_img_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1SZRF3KXV021E7BJV1BP</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredient and it feels light on my skin.  Would have given it 5 star if the tint was a bit more...this tint is very light and will not cover dark spots.  But I guess it is a tinted moisturizer so its meant to be light tint.  Regardless, I like a natural product like this that gives me high enough SPF and all natural ingredient</li>
            <li> I used a lot of brightening cosmetics because I like the feeling of glowy skin. This one is very nice, looks natural and has a very pleasant smell and spf 20 helps.</li>
            <li> This product comes out orange but does not apply orange at all.  It is actually very sheer, with little coverage.  I wouldn&#x27;t even say there&#x27;s any coverage for me, but what it does do is provide a great SPF base for my makeup. I have a history of skin cancer and the natural products without chemical sunscreens have been my major purchases lately.  Although this only has zinc and not titanium dioxide as the SPF, I still apply powder with titanium dioxide and my makeup does go on much better after I put this beauty balm on.  I have very dry skin in the winter that usually causes my makeup to cake and flake, but this really helps my dry skin to be more moisturized.  I also have a lot of sun damage with dark age spots, and this seems to be helping make my skin tone look better.  I have coupled this with the andalou naturals brightening skin polish and have been pretty happy.  Going for the night time moisturizer and serum next.  The products are well-priced and do not break me out, very natural, rated very good on EWG, and smell good!!  Most natural products have funny smells to me, but this one is very fruity.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and  I&#x27;m almost done with my first tube which I purchased two months ago. I really like this product as my daily sunscreen. I use it under my makeup or as-is. The tint is definitely not for everybody, this is best for people with yellow skin tones . I&#x27;m NC42 in MAC and this bb cream blends well and disappears on my skin. The product is thick and creamy from the tube, but sheers off when applied. It handled summer heat well, so I hope it works great with the colder weather. I have a combo skin and had no breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li> I love , love this makeup. don&#x27;t have to use additional sunscreen., sheer but good coverage. will order . awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty balm...it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, evens out my skin tone and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural foundation. Goes on smooth and I love that it has SPF in it. Lasts a long time as well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had tried my daughter&#x27;s after she had given rave reviews. Love it; very light and so sometimes mix in a bit of foundation. Great for every day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a tinted moisturizer without chemical sunscreen, and this looked like it might be just what I wanted. The scent is lovely - kind of reminiscent of oranges - and the color was just right for my light skin. The texture was another thing, though, very thick and almost feeling like there were tiny bits of grit. Over the month or so that I used it, it was feeling harder and harder to get my face clean, and I often used an exfoliator just to feel my familiar skin texture again. Magnification of my skin showed that my pores were getting larger, almost as if they were filling up with something. So, I have discontinued using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate a company that is trying to do the right thing in terms of the ingredients it&#x27;s using, and really wanted to like this product. Maybe with some refinements to their formula, I can reconsider it.</li>
            <li> I had used to buy facial sunscreen that was SPF30, free of chemicals but a lot more expensive.  I decided to try this cream because of the good reviews from EWG.  This sunscreen more than met my expectations, it&#x27;s free of chemicals, contains lots of ingredients good for your skin, protects it and plus it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  I like how it goes on smooth and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product! I wear this when I want a moisture and want to skip putting on make up. All around a must have staple.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING (citrus) and was on the EWG list of very low-toxicity BB creams, so that&#x27;s the biggest reason&lt;br /&gt;I bought it. Adds a lovely sheen to your face, but doesn&#x27;t have strong color if you&#x27;re looking for that.&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean and nourishing and I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthy spf cream and this BB cream meets the requirements. It goes on smoothly and has no harmful ingredients. It does rub off a bit in humid weather though. Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess I just didn&#x27;t realize this was more makeup than facial moisturizer. Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for just a moisturizer with spf, this stuff is HEAVY and it&#x27;s essentially foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pale and it the picture makes it look like it would be alright, but this made my face look orange like a fake tan. I went to another store and got the un-tinted kind. It&#x27;s still heavy, but for a day out it&#x27;s perfect because my skin is well protected.</li>
            <li> Love, love love this moisturizer.  I use it as my make up with just a little powder over it. It smells wonderful and I never get sunburned. I love that it&#x27;s natural and still works really well.</li>
            <li> Pros: ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Cons: texture, shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the smell of this product, but applying it is almost painful. This is thicker than any sunscreen I have ever used, so I cut it 50/50 with my favorite non-SPF face lotion from Alaffia. There is no noticeable coverage or evening of tone for me. I also do not like the shininess of my face after application.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it feels like my face is suffocating. If it were just slightly mattifying and had no SPF I would love this, but not as is and not really even with mixing with other lotion.</li>
            <li> Application is very difficult as it is thick and doesn&#x27;t apply easily.  It looked okay on but very difficult to get off, even with oil cleansing method.  Made me break out in tiny white heads.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a really awful Orange colour on my skin and I have a strong tan and use yellow based foundations. I should have taken more notice of other reviews. I thought I would be ok given my foundation colour. It is like a really bad orange fake tan. It is also very oily and bought my out in pimples. I tried to come back to it a few times same reaction. I then thought would use on arms and legs to use up and is SPF 30. If you accidentally get on your clothes it stains orange and takes several washes to get of. Would not want to get on a handle with care top or around the neckline of a blouse.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review until I had a chance to try this product several times. I trust ANDALOU  and use several of their products with very good results. This has very sheer coverage when applied with a wet sponge. The color is great on my darker than &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; Caucasian face. It would doubtless work well if the user had a bit of sun but might be too dark for some people. For me, I love it!</li>
            <li> Has a great texture, doesn&#x27;t make skin feel oily. Has a slight tint which blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and not only does it protect my skin from the sun it moisturizes it well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Great SPF and works well with my dry skin even though I may need a little extra moisture underneath in the middle of winter.  I always have it at the ready.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the physical sun protection in this, but with light skin this oxidizes quite a bit.  There isn&#x27;t any noticeable contrast when first applied, it leaves a satin finish without looking greasy, but after about 30 minutes it darkens quite a bit.  Still giving 4 stars for the great ingredient list and omission of nasty chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Mom loved my skin... Success!</li>
            <li> It is a tad slimy and greasy.  Pretty expensive for the texture.  It looks good on my pale irish skin.</li>
            <li> A little to heavy and cakey for me.</li>
            <li> Too thick...did not like it at all...</li>
            <li> This has good coverage and I like the feel of it. However, it has a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell that stays with me all day.  I asked my sister to smell my face (yes, we are close enough to do things like that) and she said she couldn&#x27;t smell it.  So, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big issue but it is annoying to smell it all day long and anyone sensitive to smells will probably not enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li> I have medium complexion, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;* What I like:&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients, stem cells, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;When applying it, this BB cream leaves my face very oily and shinning.  I have to wait a good 30 seconds before I can apply mineral powder foundation.  Start with a small quantity and apply more as you need it.  I have to apply mineral powder foundation to bring down the shine and to cover my sun spots because this BB cream gives you very little coverage.  If you use a face oil, wait until the oil is absorbed before you apply this BB cream.  I am still using it because I like the whole line but I don&#x27;t think this BB cream is as good as the Boscia BB Cream - another natural line.</li>
            <li> Love Andalou and love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I use Andalou products for most of my beauty needs, but this one is my absolute favorite. I put this on every morning either by itself or under makeup. We live in the mountains and this saves my skin all year. I frequently get asked about it since I often wear it instead of makeup. I have highly sensitive skin and this works perfectly for me! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far seems just like the others have said.</li>
            <li> NOTE: I bought this from a different vendor (not Amazon), so I AM NOT REVIEWING THIS VENDOR, but I still wanted to provide a review of the product here. I stumbled across this product and was highly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hyper-sensitive skin, and am starting to have wrinkles around my eyes and mouth, and redness around my nose.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, but when I do, I use mineral powders, because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  But, I just don&#x27;t feel like using them most days. AND, in the winter, my skin needs extra moisture and powder over moisturizer leaves a cakey mess.  I will not use a chemical primer because they cause a rash on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried this. It is great! It smells like fresh oranges, and hydrates my skin perfectly.  About the color.  I am PALE. Like, fish-belly white (that is why the little red patches beside my nose are so noticeable).  And, this does look distinctly orange out of the tube. But, I put it on and blended it in really well, and I had no noticeable orange tint on my face. It covered the redness beside my nose, without looking like I was wearing makeup. It just gave me a very natural, healthy-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is not full-coverage.  I need more concealer for my dark circles. But, a little concealer, mascara, and lip gloss, and I would be ready to go out on the town.  I like!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if it causes a rash or something, but as of right now, no issues!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD...after 3 months of continued use, I have had NO skin issues....no rash, itching, or other ill effects.  My skin  texture has improved, the red patches are fading, AND my wrinkles are actually starting to diminish. Just bought more of this product!!</li>
            <li> It has a subtle tint, not great for covering up much but moisturizes pretty well. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Looking for a tinted moisturizer without silicones was difficult but then I stumbled on Andalou Naturals and noticed they have a BB cream or essentially a tinted moisturizer. It is thicker than most moisturizers packaged in a tube due to the minerals but this gives a medium coverage making it very nice if you don&#x27;t like a lot of face makeup. It is slightly drying which means not so good for winter skin but lovely for summer skin and because its tinted, gives a summer-like glow; however it should be noted that because of the tint it is best for light-medium to darker tanned skins, or you can do what I&#x27;ve been doing, mix in a bit of your untinted moisturizer to sheer it out a bit. I will repurchase, but for Summertime use.</li>
            <li> I break out a lot with my current BB cream so I wanted to try something else, and I bought this product because I was looking for a BB cream that was more natural than most. Other reviewers said that this product left your skin orange looking though, but I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it has a nice citrus smell at first, but then it smells more like strong perfumed makeup throughout the day. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell, but it is so strong and lasts for a long time...I just don&#x27;t like it. So I try not to apply it so much near my nose. Also, it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; conceal as much as my other BB cream, and it does have a mild orange tint to it so I just rub it in really well and then lightly apply a mineral powder over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the cream. I do like the way it feels...its light and not too greasy, and it spreads well over your entire face so a little goes a long way. I like that the ingredients are nontoxic as well. It would be better though If they could just get rid of the orange tint and smell, and made it conceal a little better.</li>
            <li> The most amazing makeup product I have ever used.  I have fair to light skin and this is perfect! I promise you will not regret buying this product.  My skin feels so soft and even toned.  All that I have to do is apply a little mascara and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> I stopped using my foundation and started using this after purchasing it for twice the price on amazon at the health food store. My acne is completely gone and my skin looks plump and smooth. I have gone through 2 tubes already and have my mother hooked on it too. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a slightly darker tint for my darker olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really love all the ingredients and the light airy feel of this product. I fe like I&#x27;m doing my skin a service when I wear it. However, as the whitest white girl around, it&#x27;s just too darn tan for me. And rather than a yellow tone, it&#x27;s more reddish/orangish which is not fitting for most skin tones.  I really hope they come out with more shades.</li>
            <li> Well, everything about this product is great, except for the tint. My skin feels smoother and looks more even, but it definitely gave my skin an orange tint. Such a bummer that I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I had heard about \\&quot;BB\\&quot; creams, but didn&#x27;t know exactly what they were.  I now know that the BB means Beauty Balm or Blemish Balm. I had tried other products in my quest for the illusion of clear skin.  I had tried a sample order of Fairie Organics mineral make-up to see if it would help cover my dermatitis while simultaneously not aggravating my dermatitis.  The parts of my skin that were already clear looked \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; with the Fairie Organics mineral make-up, but the dermatitis on my chin area looked \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; after applying both the mineral make-up and the mineral concealer, and I believe that this make-up made the dermatitis worse.  While I loved the samples of the blush and eye shadow from Fairie Organics, I was less than pleased with the mineral concealer.  I was hesitant to try anything on my skin, as I didn&#x27;t want anything to aggravate my dermatitis (mostly contained to my chin area), yet this product caught my eye at my local natural health store.  It is on sale and I get to use my housemate&#x27;s discount, which makes it very affordable, plus I wear sunscreen year-round and this product has SPF 30 in it.  I tried the sampler at the store and loved it.  Be it in natural lighting or harsh artificial lighting, this stuff does not look cakey and at least on me, it does not look orange.  I have very fair skin, and it just gives me a bit more color without looking like I spent too much time at a tanning salon or with a self-tanner.  My skin shade is very fair, and the tint is perfect for me---not too much and definitely not orange.  I know that everyone&#x27;s skin tone is different and thus this tint may not be for everyone, but I hope the company will not change a thing with this formula!</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this product because of the ingredients. I am buying it once again because it provides great coverage and keeps my face looking great all day. I wish all natural cosmetic products were as good as this one</li>
            <li> This has an impressive lineup of ingredients which is why I was bummed it didn&#x27;t work out. The forumla is greasy greasy greasy. Not in the sunscreen way, but in an oily film way that never dries totally. While I tested this on my hand and wrist, I can only imagine the hair that&#x27;d stick to your face when wearing. The sheen is not natural looking. It doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. The tint is not sheer; it has an obvious orange cast that stood out on my wrist (which is very pale and neutral toned). If the above doesn&#x27;t do it for you, the smell will. It&#x27;s very strong, just like perfume. I don&#x27;t want that strong of a scent on my face, it&#x27;d overpowering to the point of inducing a headache.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really too bad, I thought I&#x27;d found &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; facial sun protectant!</li>
            <li> I use several products by Andalou so wanted to try this. This product did not have enough coverage for my situation. More like a tinted moisturizer IMO.</li>
            <li> My favorite tinted moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out nor dry me out.  I love that it uses zinc as the sunscreen rather than harsh chemicals.  Offers light coverage without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know you are using a product that isn&#x27;t bad for you, the EWG.org/skindeep score for this is very good.  It does feel a little on the thick side so doesn&#x27;t apply super easily but the tint and spf combination is convenient. I am very fair but the tint seems to be an ok color for me.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges.  Its thick but not heavy.  Dont have to use much.  As you rub it over your face it becomes thinner and spreads out evenly.  This will probably last a year.  Nice sheer coverage.  Does not have an orange tint as some others have mentioned.  Maybe they are using to much.  I use this under a light coat of face powder.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, the way it feels on my skin, and it is all natural.  I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two days and have not broken out (this usually happens quickly) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The tint evens out my skin tone.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup most days and this is perfect.  The tint is not so obvious that I need blush, I put this on and go.  I have a new favorite!  If the other skin benefits mentioned by other reviewers occur in the coming weeks, I will be ecstatic.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my semi-dry sensitive Asian skin.  Does not leave a white cast nor does it make me look orange, like I feared it would.  Goes on smoothly and has a light pleasant smell.  Does not irritate my skin.  In fact, I swear it makes my skin look smoother after use. Could this be the fruit stem cells (whatever they are!) working?  I use all organic products on my face and was looking for an inexpensive sunblock for my face that was &#x27;safe&#x27; and non-irritating.  I have used Neutrogena Ultra-sheer in the past, before going organic with my skin care products, I noticed that the Neutrogena sunscreen produced irritation/bumpy skin after use.  This Andalou sunblock is superior to Neutrogena Ultra-sheer!</li>
            <li> good coverage, good color - it is shiny, though. takes a good while before i feel comfortable putting any powder or blush over it. i never break out with it on, though, and i have very sensitive skin. the jury&#x27;s still out on whether i&#x27;ll get it again - going to try a few others first. it is in the top running.</li>
            <li> My gf has been diagnosed with Rosacea. Her skin is so sensitive she is unable to get her eyebrows waxed because it turns her skin red for days and swells up (she shaves them daily) I ordered this for her to try. She loves it! No stinging, or odd odor. She says it goes on well using a sponge, and holds up all day. She is ordering more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Finally found a bb cream that has it all - brightening, a touch of coverage, moisture, natural ingredients and spf. I wear this alone with eye concealer and a bit of blush for a natural look. My skin is so much happier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a beauty balm that was cruelty free and natural. I have other Andalou products and have found them to be gentle and effective. This product is no different. It goes on easily and I find it to be non drying. My skin is slightly oily but not so oily that I needed to buy their oily skin BB. I apply my normal moisturizer prior to applying the BB. This BB provides nice, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It covers the flaws on my skin and allows me to wear less make-up.  Very creamy and feels great on my skin all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale with freckles. This was a full shade too dark for my skin. The cream covered some of my freckles, so the coverage seems decent. But it&#x27;s so thick I find I can&#x27;t apply it all over my face without adding oil or serum. Without oil it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: since I haven&#x27;t found anything better (Juice Beauty is too expensive, Physician&#x27;s Formula is too dark) I mix it with 10% Aveda Radiance Serum and 10% vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate the good rating from EWG for safe ingredients, the quality ingredients, the way my skin looks--healthy, smooth. And that it&#x27;s a California local product.</li>
            <li> I love the SPF coverage without the risk of break-outs that many sunblocks cause. I recommend thoroughly massaging it into the skin to help with even tinting coverage. (Otherwise, it looks a little orange.) A shame about how it advertises that the color matches most skin types, though. It seems to me that it would not be a proper match for someone who is not anglo saxon, and this hardly leaves the product matching the majority of skin types!</li>
            <li> i like this bb cream, it has hyaluronic acid which i love the most but its kinda thick and just found out that theres an alcohol in it but its still a good one just hoping they remove the alcohol.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about the smell of this product. It does have a distinct odor but to me, it is not unpleasant. It is a strong citrus smell and I didn&#x27;t mind it and after 5 mins didn&#x27;t notice it. I think the product earned 5 stars for using such great ingredients that it gets good reviews on the EWG web site. I don&#x27;t want to put carcinogns and harmful stuff onto my skin. But 3 stars (giving it 4 overall) for consistency. It is a thick cream - the consistency of toothpaste and I prefer something lighter. After applying it, I felt as if my skin had a heavy layer on it and couldn;t breathe well - in summer temps and humid environments, this feels like a face mask. I also purchased the non tinted version of this - a blue label - and prefer it hands down. Has the same sun screen protection - no tint - but it lighter and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> pros: no silicone, spf 30&lt;br /&gt;cons: everything else lol. this is not for oily or acne prone skin..this never sunk into my skin. the tint was orange, literally, yet offered no coverage. it clogged my pores very badly and caused breakouts, unfortunately. i had to give this away.</li>
            <li> It works well, and my skin feels amazing. It has a nice subtle fruity smell as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a sheer tint - its a little orangey looking. But I still use it and like it.</li>
            <li> I Love this product my face looks so moisture and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a daily sunblock and this one had a high rating from the EWG&#x27;s Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.  I have sensitive skin and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice.  It has a sheer tan tint, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  I don&#x27;t mind wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does feel a bit oily (probably the moisturizer) and it leaves a film on my phone screen.  It needs to be washed off every night or you will develop a pimple or two, but that&#x27;s something I should probably be doing anyway.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well the sunscreen is working, but it smells great an goes on nice, not sticky like Badger tinted.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as I&#x27;m on my second tube.  However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the full price ($21.99) as I got it for around $12 bucks and the full price seems a little high to me.  I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews stating that this has an orange tint to it - it is &amp;#34;orange-ish&amp;#34; when coming out of the tube but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it leaving an orange tint once applied to my face.  That could be due to my skin tone though - I have a lighter olive complexion.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think it may be causing me to break out along my jaw line but this could just be a personal issue I&#x27;m having with my specific skin type and not so much a negative reflection on the product itself.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great and I really enjoy the scent!</li>
