            <li> Love these. Great for my thick curly natural hair</li>
            <li> We love these. They do a great job holding the separated hair sections.</li>
            <li> These are great can grab a decent amount of hair.  Does not get tangled in hair.  These are amazingly great.  These are just like the ones at Sally&#x27;s hair supply, ony better....they are cheaper and you get more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this! They make my blow out process so much easier!</li>
            <li> My favorite clip for doing ultra thick to thin hair. Most similar clips cost over a dollar a piece so these were very affordable. One does break here and there, but for the price, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Best clips I have ever seen.  These work!</li>
            <li> Great buy and good quality clips!</li>
            <li> I love these clips! They are great to use to hold separate pieces of hair while blow drying, ironing or dyeing! They are sturdy and good quality black plastic clips that hold very well. Good price for an 18 pack!</li>
            <li> I love the clips, however, I really would like to have some small in size.  On Amazon they do not give measurements on these clips.  The ones I have are about 5 or 6 inches long.  Since I want them to curl my hair in pin-curls, and I have a lot of hair, I have lots of curls and the clips I have are a little too large. Although I can use them my they are crowded and sort of stacked overlapping each other (hard to describe).  If there is a smaller size I&#x27;d like to know it.&lt;br /&gt;They are great clips!  I&#x27;ve never found any better.</li>
            <li> Best clips I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and these are the same quality that I would buy at the State beauty supply that only licensed hairdressers can purchase only but these are cheaper!</li>
