            <li>I love the bottle, it make it perfect to use, this is a very high quality cologne</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not a cologne that EVERYONE wears so you will smell somewhat unique, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The fragance impregnates a memorable impression wherever you go.</li>
            <li>and I was also gifted this BOSS.</li>
            <li>The top notes are made of lavender with the arboreal birch.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use Hugo Boss for years and love it, but believe the perfume I received is not original!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>We sprayed the tester on him at Kohl&#x27;s, it smelled okay, but when we got out into the parking lot  </li>
            <li>Not the best smell, have definitely smelled better stuff.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>love this much!!!!</li>
            <li>You will enjoy this distinctive scent even after many hours of action, and still will have a great smell, fading away nicely.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for a year long...</li>
            <li>nice, mild, stays all day and everyone loves it</li>
            <li>is great but is soft in night time  </li>
            <li>fast delivery and loved the price</li>
            <li>Product is of good quality and its lasts for reasonable about of time</li>
            <li>I think i was hoping for a better cologne than the original Boss bottled, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you want better than the original Boss bottled</li>
            <li>WAS VERY QUICK</li>
            <li>It it just too strong for that</li>
            <li>Try and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance last all day</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, not overpowering and is very mellow</li>
            <li>I have my doubts whether this is the original product.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent cologne for men, with a great long lasting masculine scent.</li>
            <li>We were trying to find a new one that my daughter and I both liked on him.</li>
            <li>; Like another reviewer stated the smell lasts much longer and has something fading about it.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; So good you will love it on yourself and start associating the smell with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; great bottle, not over the top, different from all my other sprays</li>
            <li>Item deliversed sooner than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Ends up smelling cloyingly sweet</li>
            <li>Hugo Boss #6, which smells just as good only with a lighter scent for working around the office.</li>
            <li>, delivery was quick and without problems.</li>
            <li>What a great fragrance and for such a good price on Amazon, easily half what I would have paid in a department store.</li>
            <li>It is a magical smell of a new life.</li>
            <li>This one ended up on top and when it ran out, I was thrilled to find it for so much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>; It is based on the strong woody accord, with the chypre musk and herbal touched to soothe his high spirits.</li>
            <li>This perfume is 100% original, when I get the box was large which I thought I had over 100 ml</li>
            <li>I really recommend this Cologne which provides great confidence in my daily activities, I can&#x27;t wait to purchase a bigger bottle if available</li>
            <li>For my 30th birthday I was gifted a Hugo Red set of cologne, bodywash and afterhsave</li>
            <li>My first impression of this was one where I feigned fainting at how rocking the smell is.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time despite his wearing it often, and has a great musky smell with undertones which I cannot place but are likely of floral origin.</li>
            <li>Smells like a soft sweet musk.</li>
            <li>The smell is disarming and large than life.</li>
            <li>I find the cologne to work best at night and in cold weather.</li>
            <li>They both really like it too.  </li>
            <li>thanks for asking</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any guy who wants to smell like a boss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a light and airy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>On a couple occasions one spray was way too much</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say go for Terre d&#x27;Hermes, a classic for evening and dressy events.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its not a strong aroma but neither a soft one, it stay for more than 5 hours, seriously you will love it if you don&#x27;t believe me just go to a store and take a sample, you wont regreat it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It represents anything, it can be a a classy cologne or it can be a party animal</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too watery, doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li>To much money for a bottle of next to no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I had so many hugo boss perfumes, and I&#x27;ve never been so obsessed with one in particular,  my friend used to use it to go to the gym</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for less than a month right now.</li>
            <li>The fragance has a gorgeous base, medium and top tones that will blend with your skin and shift subtly as time goes by.</li>

            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a little bit intense than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of the quality of fragrance from online vendors because of cheap products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected that i would get the same result with this Amazon purchase too !</li>

            <li> In the past two years, I&#x27;ve become a big fan of Hermes Terre Parfum.</li>
            <li> So you loose at least a half liquid for I pay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the spray spell does not last over an hour , I have been using Hugo Boss for past year and thats my personal firt choice when comes to Perfumes .</li>
            <li> It mixed well with the cold night air, so it definitely a &amp;#34;Date&amp;#34; colonge.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT a cologne that you wear just casually everyday to the office, and it is NOT a cologne that you wear during warm/hot summer months.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding it elsewhere--</li>
            <li> Even the smell docent retain for not more than an hour.</li>
            <li> My second gift, The Hugo Red was disappointing and ranks among the worst perfumes I</li>
            <li> Never gets me tired and my wife loves it..</li>
            <li> product is totally fake</li>
            <li> you are considering buying something else over this, please try this once, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am quite disappointed with my decision .</li>
            <li> i am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The musky base on the woody notes impart it the firmness.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I had so many hugo boss perfumes, and I&#x27;ve never been so obsessed with one in particular,  my friend used to use it to go to the gym and after i smelt it for god sake it smells like heaven. Its not a strong aroma but neither a soft one, it stay for more than 5 hours, seriously you will love it if you don&#x27;t believe me just go to a store and take a sample, you wont regreat it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this. I think i was hoping for a better cologne than the original Boss bottled, but it wasn&#x27;t. If you want better than the original Boss bottled i&#x27;d say go for Terre d&#x27;Hermes, a classic for evening and dressy events. If the cost is steep, go for Dolce&amp;Gabbana the One, if still steep, go for CK Man.</li>
            <li> Good price. Item deliversed sooner than expected and in great condition. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> (a woman&#x27;s review) I bought this for my lover, and both of us absolutely liked it. The fragance has a gorgeous base, medium and top tones that will blend with your skin and shift subtly as time goes by. You will enjoy this distinctive scent even after many hours of action, and still will have a great smell, fading away nicely. The fragance impregnates a memorable impression wherever you go.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and loved the price</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cologne for men, with a great long lasting masculine scent. I find the cologne to work best at night and in cold weather. This is NOT a cologne that you wear just casually everyday to the office, and it is NOT a cologne that you wear during warm/hot summer months. It it just too strong for that and will be too overpowering for you, and definitely for the people around you! But for winter months, this is an amazing cologne! Also, it&#x27;s not a cologne that EVERYONE wears so you will smell somewhat unique, which is a good thing. I would highly recommend. Overall - 5/5</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful scent for a man. love this much!!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband and he loves it.  It is a great fragrance with the perfect balance - not too mild and not too strong.  It is so good that I ended up getting one for my dad, and my brother.  They both really like it too.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In the past two years, I&#x27;ve become a big fan of Hermes Terre Parfum. The smell is disarming and large than life. For my 30th birthday I was gifted a Hugo Red set of cologne, bodywash and afterhsave and I was also gifted this BOSS. My first impression of this was one where I feigned fainting at how rocking the smell is. It is a magical smell of a new life. I love the bottle, it make it perfect to use, this is a very high quality cologne and I think I will always use this. My second gift, The Hugo Red was disappointing and ranks among the worst perfumes I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Like another reviewer stated the smell lasts much longer and has something fading about it.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; So good you will love it on yourself and start associating the smell with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; great bottle, not over the top, different from all my other sprays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars? I&#x27;ve only used it for less than a month right now. Thats why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying something else over this, please try this once, you wont be disappointed. Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this description from some fragrance site,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; It is based on the strong woody accord, with the chypre musk and herbal touched to soothe his high spirits. The top notes are made of lavender with the arboreal birch. The heart of violet is a manifestation of his genteel. The musky base on the woody notes impart it the firmness.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hugo Boss, great perfum, nice fragance, I mean, it is great, and the price is the best, really good, quite satisfy</li>
            <li> Product is of good quality and its lasts for reasonable about of time</li>

            <li> IT IS EXCELLENT PRODUCT THE RECOMMEND ALWAYS BUY THIS BRAND OF PRODUCT DELIVERY WAS VERY QUICK IS IDEAL FOR MY NEEDS THE FELICITAS 5 STAR</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to get fragrance from Amazon but i think fro now I will start doing it. I am always skeptical of the quality of fragrance from online vendors because of cheap products.&lt;br /&gt;But i think my experience was good and i would start ordering perfumes from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product review:&lt;br /&gt;I liked this. My friend owned it and i just wanted to have this product. It smells awesome and sticks with you for hours (around 8-10). This one is added to my good fragrance list now.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  I like this perfume. The price is great. I am using it every day. Try and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Fragrance not lasting as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance last all day even if you don&#x27;t realize it everyone around you does.</li>
            <li> It looks good but unfortunately the spray spell does not last over an hour , I have been using Hugo Boss for past year and thats my personal firt choice when comes to Perfumes . I expected that i would get the same result with this Amazon purchase too !&lt;br /&gt;i am quite disappointed with my decision . Awaiting response from the Seller on it .</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, not overpowering and is very mellow&lt;br /&gt;It represents anything, it can be a a classy cologne or it can be a party animal</li>
            <li> nice, mild, stays all day and everyone loves it</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived just as expected.  Smells great and looks great on the counter in the bathroom. My wife loves the smell as well</li>
            <li> Smells like a weaker version of Fahrenheit 451 cologne.  Ends up smelling cloyingly sweet</li>
            <li> product is totally fake no smell no nothing just alcohol and water mixed together.I got nothing in this botlle i will never order again cologne online</li>
            <li> Smells good!  Had trouble finding it elsewhere--can always count on Amazon to find almost anything. Bought this for my husband after smelling one of those cards in a magazine- he liked it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent and nice. I love it</li>
            <li> The price it&#x27;s good, but you shipping to me another product. I receive a kit, but I don&#x27;t use the others itens execept the fragance. So you loose at least a half liquid for I pay.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragance and bottle. I don&#x27;t like the change without my autthorization.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I will not recomend to my friends and paratentals.</li>
            <li> I use Hugo Boss for years and love it, but believe the perfume I received is not original!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too watery, doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li> My husband tried that test set of colognes from Sephora. We were trying to find a new one that my daughter and I both liked on him.This one ended up on top and when it ran out, I was thrilled to find it for so much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received an open box item which even docent have the plastic cover in the box.. i am so disappointed. Even the smell docent retain for not more than an hour. I have my doubts whether this is the original product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  To much money for a bottle of next to no fragrance.  Instead of Hugo Boss it should be called Hugo Loss.  I have Burberry London and Dolce &amp;Gabbana Pour Homme and Hugo Boss can&#x27;t even be compared to them.</li>
            <li> Never gets me tired and my wife loves it.. The size is perfect for a year long... thanks for asking</li>
            <li> This perfume is 100% original, when I get the box was large which I thought I had over 100 ml but when opened the box I realized realized that everything was, delivery was quick and without problems. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I found the product excellent</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and so does my wife!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. My SO got this for me as a christmas gift as I&#x27;m a fan of Aqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani. The scents are similar but I believe this one takes the gold. Great for a day at the office or a night out. 5/5 Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Xmas.  We sprayed the tester on him at Kohl&#x27;s, it smelled okay, but when we got out into the parking lot  the wind blew the colonge in my direction and it was... enticing.  It mixed well with the cold night air, so it definitely a &amp;#34;Date&amp;#34; colonge.  I also got him the &amp;#34;Day&amp;#34; version, Hugo Boss #6, which smells just as good only with a lighter scent for working around the office.</li>
            <li> What a great fragrance and for such a good price on Amazon, easily half what I would have paid in a department store.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time; it has a great smell. It is good for any occasion! I would recommend it to any guy who wants to smell like a boss.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this Cologne which provides great confidence in my daily activities, I can&#x27;t wait to purchase a bigger bottle if available</li>
            <li> I love this smell! It&#x27;s such a light and airy fragrance.  I got it for my husband and he loves his present.</li>
            <li> Husband wears this each day. Lasts a long time despite his wearing it often, and has a great musky smell with undertones which I cannot place but are likely of floral origin. Smells like a soft sweet musk. Id recommend it but I dont want everyone I know to smell like my hubby. Quality bottle, nice packaging. On a couple occasions one spray was way too much so I think the pump on our last ordered bottle was a bit amiss. Maybe do a different seller form the one I used.</li>
            <li> Not the best smell, have definitely smelled better stuff. Very strong but not in a good way. Would not recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Very good scent! I gave it 4 stars because it is a little bit intense than I expected. It lasts for a day or two without sweating.</li>
            <li> spectacular fragrance. i love it</li>
            <li> is great but is soft in night time  I will spray at night for party time!!! I recommended feel the time</li>
