            <li>love this product the best and until proven otherwise</li>
            <li>Dad likes it just as well as he ever liked the Fasteeth, &amp; I like the fact that it wasn&#x27;t sitting on a warehouse shelf for 2-4 years!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>Does not have a good hold and leaves goop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-Poligrip Strips:  </li>
            <li>not as good as poligrip</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s a good recommendation so be it.</li>
            <li>This powder is good but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as Polident powder did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing available.</li>
            <li>good price&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>Fixodent is the best adhesive available for dentures, use it longer than 36 years daily.&lt;br /&gt;STRONGLY</li>
            <li>Adhesive power exceptional.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This proves that if something is good, really good, you should buy a lifetime supply before it is discontinued!</li>
            <li>best experience has been with POLIGRIP POWDER DENTURE ADHESIVE, manufactured in the US by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), a fact that would imply a certain level of stability.  </li>
            <li>I did not get any kind of sales slip with the one I got.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was absolutely thrilled to have this arrive at her door.  </li>
            <li>Good holding power, long-lasting, and usually easy to remove from mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>As new denture wearer, I have experimented with nearly available adhesive and decided that POLIGRIP POWDER is best for me.  </li>
            <li>Good Morning, Very good and smart the product, thanks for your service and for your patience and god bles dear frends,</li>
            <li>Dispenses smoothly and holds well!</li>
            <li>you may love it.</li>
            <li>works much better for me ,then the adhesive</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>this product can be find at anywhere for under 10 $ the most... ($ 5.99 at CVS)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years,  Am satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is so much better for the top than the paste was.</li>
            <li>product I&#x27;ve used for many years and cheaper on amazon than the store.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than any of the cream stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li>I found that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder is the best and works for me.  </li>
            <li>It does have the best holding power of all the above products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that there are many reviews regarding warnings about Zinc</li>
            <li>unless you plan on ingesting a teaspoon of this powder each day, I think you are safe and the Zinc in Fixodent won&#x27;t upset the Zinc ratio that your body</li>
            <li>Mist some water on the powder on top, wait a minute and then place in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Better for me since Equate is so inexpensive.t</li>
            <li>Mist some water on the powder on top, wait a minute and then place in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Better for me since Equate is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Like Rigident but better.</li>
            <li>Thank You for the great service and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that holds so well.  </li>

            <li>Not only the best hold</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Holds better than any... price as gone through the clouds..needs to be more affordable again .  </li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this after Poligrip quit making the powder.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different denture adhesives, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>it has no taste nor odor, and patients feel more confident wearing they dentures.</li>
            <li>Pop the top of the bottle off with your finger</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I actually love it</li>
            <li>but I like it better than any denture adhesive I have tried.</li>
            <li>So, if my grandma loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years -</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>First of all, if you buy on Amazon (4 a pack) then this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The item is great and has a new customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this product because it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>since the top dentures have a full plate that serves as a suction, most people don&#x27;t have too many problems with them.  </li>
            <li>NATIONAL BRAND PRODUCT IN A LARGE PACKAGE AT A FAIR PRICE.  </li>
            <li>Now my lower dentures are more secure and don&#x27;t slip like they did.  </li>
            <li>super strength is far superior!</li>
            <li>Works great with good fitting denture that needs a little help and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does not ooze out and by the end of the day, it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>its neat and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold much better then the clay like substance plus easier to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>This adhesive powder is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy shopping to help my dad.</li>
            <li>She said not as strong as rigident, but for the price , it will do.  </li>
            <li>However, the zinc can cause nausea at times and the taste can be strong at times.</li>
            <li>Good product, can&#x27;t be found in Belize, Which is where I live.</li>
            <li>It is a strong hold and easy to remove and clean up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Fixodent cream:  Does not have such a great hold and is goopy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your dentures must fit well to use it.  </li>
            <li>If performance is important, FIXODENT earns 1 star.  </li>
            <li>Thank u this product works great for upper and lower dentures..thank u again</li>
            <li>I have found that the cheap equate stuff will do the job.</li>
            <li>The top dentures were easier to get accustomed to because I had two implants on the right side of my jaw</li>
            <li>Great hold as long as your teeth fit well.</li>
            <li>Bearing in mind that the bottom dentures are not ill fitting</li>
            <li>The most aggravating part is trying to find the exact amount to put on the dentures that won&#x27;t ooze out.  </li>
            <li>This is the original stuff; it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>its worth the money and easy too clean up at night.</li>
            <li>Clean and reliable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why it is not available in the UK but the delivery from the US was very good and will buy again.</li>
            <li>However as with Poligrip Strips, it has no bad taste or goop</li>
            <li>Arrived  quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I parked a spare POLIGRIP at my sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I parked a spare POLIGRIP at my sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Glue works best for all day hold, powder and adhesive at least holds for half the day and one good meal of eating.</li>
            <li>Wish I had my own teeth back!  </li>
            <li>Was larger than expected so that was a great surprise!  </li>
            <li>I also like adhesive because it helps me to talk clearer and smile.  </li>
            <li>I know of people who have used this product for over 25 years and are still alive and healthy.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, I can laugh without losing my teeth..</li>
            <li>Hold for a minute or two and try not to drink or eat right away.  </li>
            <li>Hold for a minute or two and try not to drink or eat right away.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m getting used to my dentures right now, I will stand by using this Fixodent adhesive powder over adhesive creams/glues any day.  </li>
            <li>full&amp;#34; and by using the powder, not only do the dentures stick better &amp; longer, but they allow the dentures to fit much better and more naturally because there is less &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; in between the gums and the dentures.  </li>
            <li>I recomend this product to all my patients that wear dentures and they have like it very much.</li>
            <li>I noticed that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder works better with the Walmart cream vs Fixodent cream.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder works better with the Walmart cream vs Fixodent cream.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>My dentist provided a plastic denture cup (another topic) and sample-sized tube of adhesive, so that was my first experience, and may explain consumer preference.  </li>
            <li>the product costs only slightly more.  </li>
            <li>While sorting it out, I use sparingly and continue my search.expect denture powder to be safe for its intended use, WARNING LABELS are extensive and not to be ignored..</li>
            <li>I like the powder better, it last longer too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many denture pastes but I always come back to the Fixodent powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does Fixodent powder hold the denture better, it comes out in a strip.</li>
            <li>but it is more comfortable and there is no residual mess when the dentures are taken out.</li>
            <li>For better fit put a little amount of water on your dentures and then add the Fixodent powder.</li>
            <li>Bought too much without trying it first.</li>
            <li>and I can certainly see why.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much, much better than the gels or pastes he used to use and holds very securely, and you only have to use a slight dusting of the power on the denture.  </li>
            <li>But, that may be because my teeth are too loose, so I notice it more.</li>
            <li>Used for years - do not like creams - very hard to find this in stores so this bulk buy is great</li>
            <li>I first thought that my tongue had to get used to the new application, but after a week of using this product, I now realized that my tongue was allergic to the Zinc!</li>
            <li>I understand that this product was banned in May 2010  because of its high zinc content, so it shouldn&#x27;t be marketed anymore !</li>
            <li>The whole world is grateful..</li>
            <li>Fixodent works very well</li>
            <li>the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Works better than paste and prefer this over other products/</li>
            <li>My husband prefers this to the other brands because he says it holds better</li>
            <li>The main advantage here is the amount you get for how much you pay.</li>
            <li>Possibly because it goes in your mouth and any reasonable person would expect denture powder to be safe for its intended use, WARNING LABELS are extensive and not to be ignored..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young (34 yrs.</li>
            <li>If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li>This product i bought for my dad is great, he said he can eat his food and not have to worry about his dentures getting loose, he also said the denture last a long time during the day, i will buy again</li>
            <li>Pop the top back on the bottle  before screwing the cap back on.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product as I think adhesives are less messier than creams and this adhesive was more sturdier.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the powder.</li>
            <li>I use a little adhesive on the top denture and I am all set.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about this, I want my PolyGrip powder back.</li>
            <li>First, I bought regular cream, but the goop was too much for me.</li>
            <li>&quot; I am sure that zinc has been an ingredient in this product for a long time, but the warning has never been so obviously posted, and so clearly expressed as now.</li>
            <li>In this shipment, Fixodent clearly stated that there was a \\&quot;New Label Information.\\</li>
            <li>And at night when I&#x27;m ready to take the dentures out the residue odd very easy to remove as opposed to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Works well, but I&#x27;m sensitive to zinc.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;ve never tried to explain it.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it last the whole day,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to search the ingredients for toxic substances; the entire back panel of the box enclosed bottle are filled with a list of BOLDFACE TYPE WARNINGS related to the product&#x27;s ZINC CONTENTS.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to search the ingredients for toxic substances; the entire back panel of the box enclosed bottle are filled with a list of BOLDFACE TYPE WARNINGS related to the product&#x27;s ZINC CONTENTS.  </li>
            <li>I did find it on ebay, but it was all left-over stock, over 2 years old.</li>
            <li>This is really the only place to buy this.  </li>
            <li>really like a different brand.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that really holds my dentures in place.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been unavailable for months due to &amp;#34;raw materials shortage&amp;#34;; and  despite my best efforts, there remains only online sellers that are &amp;#34;scalping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Dry your plate first before just wetting the inside of it with your finger.</li>
            <li>I have to learn how much to use, but it is much better and less messy.  </li>
            <li>This one fits the bill and lasts a very long time making it very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few products besides Secure that has allowed me to eat solid food.  </li>
            <li>This works for the upper dentures as they don&#x27;t need much hold; however, I do something different for the bottom that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt hold that great and has zinc which is really bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wet the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 4 pack but only got 1 bottle on my second order, after getting only 2 bottles on my first order though I ordered the same 4 pack,&lt;br /&gt;an had to return them both for a refund.</li>
            <li>This is truly the only product that works for me, not only holding the dentures in place all day but doing so comfortably since it has a cushioning effect, allowing me to eat foods with ease that would normally be difficult if not impossible.</li>
            <li>Although present throughout the human body and naturally occurring in trace amounts of food, regular intake, including supplements, above those amounts comes at considerable risk (web md, mayoclinic.com)  </li>

            <li>Carefully applied to avoid ingestion, FIXODENT deposited a strong, bitter taste that lingered until I had my first coffee, which caused the lower denture to come loose and release more of the bad taste and swallowed along with the coffee.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like Super Poligrip Adhesive Powder - has a weird, funny taste when used; however, have no choices left for any denture powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because the tip is small I can get it right in the groove of the denture.</li>
            <li>Another way to use the Fixodent powder is to place a thin strip of Fixodent Adhesive Cream on a dry denture and then sprinkle Fixodent Extra Hold Powder on top of the cream</li>

            <li> works great as advertized</li>
            <li> it does a great job - wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> great price and service</li>
            <li> I love it the best.  </li>
            <li> love this product the best and until proven otherwise</li>
            <li> love this product the best and until proven otherwise</li>
            <li> Dad likes it just as well as he ever liked the Fasteeth, &amp; I like the fact that it wasn&#x27;t sitting on a warehouse shelf for 2-4 years!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Does not have a good hold and leaves goop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-Poligrip Strips:  </li>
            <li> not as good as poligrip</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s a good recommendation so be it.</li>
            <li> This powder is good but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as Polident powder did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing available.</li>
            <li> good price&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> Fixodent is the best adhesive available for dentures, use it longer than 36 years daily.&lt;br /&gt;STRONGLY</li>
            <li> Adhesive power exceptional.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This proves that if something is good, really good, you should buy a lifetime supply before it is discontinued!</li>
            <li> best experience has been with POLIGRIP POWDER DENTURE ADHESIVE, manufactured in the US by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), a fact that would imply a certain level of stability.  </li>
            <li> I did not get any kind of sales slip with the one I got.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was absolutely thrilled to have this arrive at her door.  </li>
            <li> Good holding power, long-lasting, and usually easy to remove from mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> As new denture wearer, I have experimented with nearly available adhesive and decided that POLIGRIP POWDER is best for me.  </li>
            <li> Good Morning, Very good and smart the product, thanks for your service and for your patience and god bles dear frends,</li>
            <li> Dispenses smoothly and holds well!</li>
            <li> you may love it.</li>
            <li> works much better for me ,then the adhesive</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> this product can be find at anywhere for under 10 $ the most... ($ 5.99 at CVS)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years,  Am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is so much better for the top than the paste was.</li>
            <li> product I&#x27;ve used for many years and cheaper on amazon than the store.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than any of the cream stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> I found that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder is the best and works for me.  </li>
            <li> It does have the best holding power of all the above products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that there are many reviews regarding warnings about Zinc</li>
            <li> unless you plan on ingesting a teaspoon of this powder each day, I think you are safe and the Zinc in Fixodent won&#x27;t upset the Zinc ratio that your body</li>
            <li> Mist some water on the powder on top, wait a minute and then place in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Better for me since Equate is so inexpensive.t</li>
            <li> Mist some water on the powder on top, wait a minute and then place in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Better for me since Equate is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Like Rigident but better.</li>
            <li> Thank You for the great service and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that holds so well.  </li>
            <li> three more a box lasts 1 month</li>
            <li> WAS GLAD TO FIND IIT HERE.</li>
            <li> Not only the best hold</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Holds better than any... price as gone through the clouds..needs to be more affordable again .  </li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this after Poligrip quit making the powder.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different denture adhesives, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> it has no taste nor odor, and patients feel more confident wearing they dentures.</li>
            <li> Pop the top of the bottle off with your finger</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I actually love it</li>
            <li> but I like it better than any denture adhesive I have tried.</li>
            <li> So, if my grandma loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years -</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> First of all, if you buy on Amazon (4 a pack) then this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The item is great and has a new customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this product because it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> since the top dentures have a full plate that serves as a suction, most people don&#x27;t have too many problems with them.  </li>
            <li> NATIONAL BRAND PRODUCT IN A LARGE PACKAGE AT A FAIR PRICE.  </li>
            <li> Now my lower dentures are more secure and don&#x27;t slip like they did.  </li>
            <li> super strength is far superior!</li>
            <li> Works great with good fitting denture that needs a little help and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does not ooze out and by the end of the day, it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> its neat and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold much better then the clay like substance plus easier to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> This adhesive powder is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Easy shopping to help my dad.</li>
            <li> She said not as strong as rigident, but for the price , it will do.  </li>
            <li> However, the zinc can cause nausea at times and the taste can be strong at times.</li>
            <li> Good product, can&#x27;t be found in Belize, Which is where I live.</li>
            <li> It is a strong hold and easy to remove and clean up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Fixodent cream:  Does not have such a great hold and is goopy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your dentures must fit well to use it.  </li>
            <li> If performance is important, FIXODENT earns 1 star.  </li>
            <li> Thank u this product works great for upper and lower dentures..thank u again</li>
            <li> I have found that the cheap equate stuff will do the job.</li>
            <li> The top dentures were easier to get accustomed to because I had two implants on the right side of my jaw</li>
            <li> Great hold as long as your teeth fit well.</li>
            <li> Bearing in mind that the bottom dentures are not ill fitting</li>
            <li> The most aggravating part is trying to find the exact amount to put on the dentures that won&#x27;t ooze out.  </li>
            <li> This is the original stuff; it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> its worth the money and easy too clean up at night.</li>
            <li> Clean and reliable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it is not available in the UK but the delivery from the US was very good and will buy again.</li>
            <li> However as with Poligrip Strips, it has no bad taste or goop</li>
            <li> Arrived  quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I parked a spare POLIGRIP at my sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I parked a spare POLIGRIP at my sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Glue works best for all day hold, powder and adhesive at least holds for half the day and one good meal of eating.</li>
            <li> Wish I had my own teeth back!  </li>
            <li> Was larger than expected so that was a great surprise!  </li>
            <li> I also like adhesive because it helps me to talk clearer and smile.  </li>
            <li> I know of people who have used this product for over 25 years and are still alive and healthy.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, I can laugh without losing my teeth..</li>
            <li> Hold for a minute or two and try not to drink or eat right away.  </li>
            <li> Hold for a minute or two and try not to drink or eat right away.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m getting used to my dentures right now, I will stand by using this Fixodent adhesive powder over adhesive creams/glues any day.  </li>
            <li> full&amp;#34; and by using the powder, not only do the dentures stick better &amp; longer, but they allow the dentures to fit much better and more naturally because there is less &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; in between the gums and the dentures.  </li>
            <li> I recomend this product to all my patients that wear dentures and they have like it very much.</li>
            <li> I noticed that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder works better with the Walmart cream vs Fixodent cream.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder works better with the Walmart cream vs Fixodent cream.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> My dentist provided a plastic denture cup (another topic) and sample-sized tube of adhesive, so that was my first experience, and may explain consumer preference.  </li>
            <li> the product costs only slightly more.  </li>
            <li> While sorting it out, I use sparingly and continue my search.expect denture powder to be safe for its intended use, WARNING LABELS are extensive and not to be ignored..</li>
            <li> I like the powder better, it last longer too.</li>
            <li> I have tried many denture pastes but I always come back to the Fixodent powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does Fixodent powder hold the denture better, it comes out in a strip.</li>
            <li> but it is more comfortable and there is no residual mess when the dentures are taken out.</li>
            <li> For better fit put a little amount of water on your dentures and then add the Fixodent powder.</li>
            <li> Bought too much without trying it first.</li>
            <li> and I can certainly see why.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much better than the gels or pastes he used to use and holds very securely, and you only have to use a slight dusting of the power on the denture.  </li>
            <li> But, that may be because my teeth are too loose, so I notice it more.</li>
            <li> Used for years - do not like creams - very hard to find this in stores so this bulk buy is great</li>
            <li> I first thought that my tongue had to get used to the new application, but after a week of using this product, I now realized that my tongue was allergic to the Zinc!</li>
            <li> I understand that this product was banned in May 2010  because of its high zinc content, so it shouldn&#x27;t be marketed anymore !</li>
            <li> The whole world is grateful..</li>
            <li> Fixodent works very well</li>
            <li> the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Works better than paste and prefer this over other products/</li>
            <li> My husband prefers this to the other brands because he says it holds better</li>
            <li> The main advantage here is the amount you get for how much you pay.</li>
            <li> Possibly because it goes in your mouth and any reasonable person would expect denture powder to be safe for its intended use, WARNING LABELS are extensive and not to be ignored..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young (34 yrs.</li>
            <li> If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li> This product i bought for my dad is great, he said he can eat his food and not have to worry about his dentures getting loose, he also said the denture last a long time during the day, i will buy again</li>
            <li> Pop the top back on the bottle  before screwing the cap back on.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as I think adhesives are less messier than creams and this adhesive was more sturdier.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the powder.</li>
            <li> I use a little adhesive on the top denture and I am all set.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about this, I want my PolyGrip powder back.</li>
            <li> First, I bought regular cream, but the goop was too much for me.</li>
            <li> &quot; I am sure that zinc has been an ingredient in this product for a long time, but the warning has never been so obviously posted, and so clearly expressed as now.</li>
            <li> In this shipment, Fixodent clearly stated that there was a \\&quot;New Label Information.\\</li>
            <li> And at night when I&#x27;m ready to take the dentures out the residue odd very easy to remove as opposed to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I&#x27;m sensitive to zinc.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve never tried to explain it.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it last the whole day,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to search the ingredients for toxic substances; the entire back panel of the box enclosed bottle are filled with a list of BOLDFACE TYPE WARNINGS related to the product&#x27;s ZINC CONTENTS.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to search the ingredients for toxic substances; the entire back panel of the box enclosed bottle are filled with a list of BOLDFACE TYPE WARNINGS related to the product&#x27;s ZINC CONTENTS.  </li>
            <li> I did find it on ebay, but it was all left-over stock, over 2 years old.</li>
            <li> This is really the only place to buy this.  </li>
            <li> really like a different brand.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that really holds my dentures in place.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been unavailable for months due to &amp;#34;raw materials shortage&amp;#34;; and  despite my best efforts, there remains only online sellers that are &amp;#34;scalping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Dry your plate first before just wetting the inside of it with your finger.</li>
            <li> I have to learn how much to use, but it is much better and less messy.  </li>
            <li> This one fits the bill and lasts a very long time making it very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products besides Secure that has allowed me to eat solid food.  </li>
            <li> This works for the upper dentures as they don&#x27;t need much hold; however, I do something different for the bottom that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt hold that great and has zinc which is really bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wet the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 pack but only got 1 bottle on my second order, after getting only 2 bottles on my first order though I ordered the same 4 pack,&lt;br /&gt;an had to return them both for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is truly the only product that works for me, not only holding the dentures in place all day but doing so comfortably since it has a cushioning effect, allowing me to eat foods with ease that would normally be difficult if not impossible.</li>
            <li> Although present throughout the human body and naturally occurring in trace amounts of food, regular intake, including supplements, above those amounts comes at considerable risk (web md, mayoclinic.com)  </li>
            <li> Although present throughout the human body and naturally occurring in trace amounts of food, regular intake, including supplements, above those amounts comes at considerable risk (web md, mayoclinic.com)  </li>
            <li> Carefully applied to avoid ingestion, FIXODENT deposited a strong, bitter taste that lingered until I had my first coffee, which caused the lower denture to come loose and release more of the bad taste and swallowed along with the coffee.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like Super Poligrip Adhesive Powder - has a weird, funny taste when used; however, have no choices left for any denture powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the tip is small I can get it right in the groove of the denture.</li>
            <li> Another way to use the Fixodent powder is to place a thin strip of Fixodent Adhesive Cream on a dry denture and then sprinkle Fixodent Extra Hold Powder on top of the cream</li>
            <li> Another way to use the Fixodent powder is to place a thin strip of Fixodent Adhesive Cream on a dry denture and then sprinkle Fixodent Extra Hold Powder on top of the cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that denture adhesive paste outsells any powder which may explain lack of choices and the marketplace&#x27;s slow response to current shortage.  </li>
            <li> I expect this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> No more searching, and no more worrying about keeping her dentures securely fastened.</li>
            <li> If you put too much, it will hold but it tends to ooze out and it is hard to remove with your fingers or a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The air you breath is more dangerous.</li>
            <li> However until I get my dentures permanently set (I get soft relines every few weeks while my gums heal and form)</li>
            <li> Does not hold for long</li>
            <li> Does not hold for long either.  </li>
            <li> Does not hold very long.</li>
            <li> to use:  Most people say to sprinkle Fixodent on wet dentures and then get rid of excess (almost like what you do when you flour a piece of chicken).  </li>
            <li> old) and destroyed my teeth because of excessive smoking (2 packs a day).  </li>
            <li> As soon as you eat, the denture comes loose.  </li>
            <li> I never have to worry about dentures coming loose no matter what I eat.</li>
            <li> If your dentures are a bit loose you can use this product.</li>
            <li> I just recently got my upper/lower dentures less than a month ago or so.  </li>
            <li> I am currently spending half of what I use to spend on creams alone.</li>
            <li> &quot; This new labeling warns the user that the zinc in the powder is \\&quot;reported to be associated with serious health problems.\\</li>
            <li> I really feel bad because I really like the easiness of the powder (didn&#x27;t leave gloop when you took out your dentures).</li>
            <li> I then use a spray bottle and wet the powder but not drench it.  </li>
            <li> I wet it so that when I place it on my lower gums, the product doesn&#x27;t fall into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I then use a spray bottle and wet the powder but not drench it.  </li>
            <li> I wet it so that when I place it on my lower gums, the product doesn&#x27;t fall into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Dear readers: I have partial dentures for now, and I needed an adhesive for them.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle the powder on the wet part of the plate, and then pour the excess onto the paper.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from a small rural community without a lot of shopping options.</li>
            <li> I immediately went back to cream and from there on, I had no more problems.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I purchased 6 bottles of POLIGRIP from an AMAZON.COM MERCHANT for the convenience and small savings compared to local grocery and chain drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine that it is by choice that the manufacturer cautions its customer to use no more than one quarter teaspoon, to use it only once a day, and other PRECAUTIONS..</li>
            <li> not sure what the future will bring.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine that it is by choice that the manufacturer cautions its customer to use no more than one quarter teaspoon, to use it only once a day, and other PRECAUTIONS..</li>
            <li> not sure what the future will bring.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily to wet dentures and holds longer than any I have ever used - and the part is it does not ooze out!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do so you won&#x27;t use any other adhesive again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT taste is not only harsh but makes my stomach feel raw.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that isn&#x27;t saying much.  </li>
            <li> We do not end up spending endless time trying to remove little pieces.</li>
            <li> Lowers on the other hand, tend to come out after a meal, unless I also use a little bit of cream in addition to the powder.</li>
            <li> only became aware of this when attempting to reorder after starting my last bottle, 6-8 weeks supply,  Feeling desperate but not a hundred bucks desperate, and without checking ingredients, I ordered FIXODENT POWDER DENTURE ADHESIVE</li>
            <li> Product expires in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I still have to take small bites and chew carefully</li>
            <li> If you put too little because you fear it will ooze out and expand then</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of tugging, in fact,  to get it to release my denture when it&#x27;s time to take it out of my mouth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Husband uses this all the time.  Good product.</li>
            <li> It has zinc in it, no good for the mouth or body</li>
            <li> Dispenses smoothly and holds well!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this, I want my PolyGrip powder back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it is not available in the UK but the delivery from the US was very good and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Holds without the ooze of paste!</li>
            <li> I like it for what I need it for.  Wish I had my own teeth back!  That it can not replace!</li>
            <li> I tried to like this. I was desperate for a powder adhesive after Poligrip stopped making theirs. This stuff is disgusting tasting, leaves a nasty taste in your mouth the whole time. Doesnt hold that great and has zinc which is really bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY away. Look for poligrip adhesive or the glue or the strips. Glue works best for all day hold, powder and adhesive at least holds for half the day and one good meal of eating.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item from Amazon before. I noticed this time that the box was redesigned. In this shipment, Fixodent clearly stated that there was a \\&quot;New Label Information.\\&quot; This new labeling warns the user that the zinc in the powder is \\&quot;reported to be associated with serious health problems.\\&quot; I am sure that zinc has been an ingredient in this product for a long time, but the warning has never been so obviously posted, and so clearly expressed as now. If this warning had been included in the Amazon ad, I would not have ordered this product, and I would not be going through the expense of returning it.</li>
            <li> I understand that this product was banned in May 2010  because of its high zinc content, so it shouldn&#x27;t be marketed anymore !&lt;br /&gt;Refer to this article http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/news/20110215/zinc-poisoning-linked-to-popular-denture-creams&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not help to market product like this !</li>
            <li> Was larger than expected so that was a great surprise!  Arrived  quickly.</li>
            <li> Yes I am not a powder person. Bought too much without trying it first. My advice just buy one - you may love it.</li>
            <li> works much better for me ,then the adhesive</li>
            <li> I like this alot because it holds very tight.  I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have to have adhesive powder to hold in my upper and lower denture. This one fits the bill and lasts a very long time making it very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I&#x27;m sensitive to zinc.  The sensation is maddening after a few hours.  I have a neighbor who has been using it &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; -- She can&#x27;t taste it, she has no bizarre sensations -- Me?  It feels like -- Wow, I&#x27;ve never tried to explain it.  Ever accidentally chew on a piece of tin foil and get that &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; feeling?  This is about 1/1000th of that sensation.  But enough that I can feel it - and enough that I just can&#x27;t use it.  Handing it off to my neighbor and keeping an eye out for PoliGrip powder again.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Super Poligrip Adhesive Powder - has a weird, funny taste when used; however, have no choices left for any denture powder.&lt;br /&gt;Do hope that Poligrip will come back with their denture powder.</li>
            <li> this is the only place i can find it I work for a dental office and our patient luv this stuff</li>
            <li> works for my husband every day</li>
            <li> BUT the Amazon price is just out if the reality.... this product can be find at anywhere for under 10 $ the most... ($ 5.99 at CVS)</li>
            <li> USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my dentures hold all day &amp; night. For better fit put a little amount of water on your dentures and then add the Fixodent powder. It makes a perfect seal.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years,  Am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Well now......NOW I can put my dentures back into my mouth...The whole world is grateful..</li>
            <li> This is so much better for the top than the paste was. It is a strong hold and easy to remove and clean up.</li>
            <li> Works great -holds great...BUT taste is not only harsh but makes my stomach feel raw. No clue why...just a warning.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Best way to get the best adhesive. I prefer the powder to the creme. It just lasts longer for me.</li>
            <li> Fixodent Denture Adhesive Powder works great. Use it once in the morning &amp; it last the whole day, Unlike the Fixodent Denture Cream ,  that last max up to 4/5 hours. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Works better than paste and prefer this over other products/</li>
            <li> product I&#x27;ve used for many years and cheaper on amazon than the store. I like it much better than any of the cream stuff.</li>
            <li> Fixodent works very well</li>
            <li> NATIONAL BRAND PRODUCT IN A LARGE PACKAGE AT A FAIR PRICE.  I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> I had surgery to remove all my remaining teeth in the end of February 2015.  I received my dentures in April so my gums were still healing.  Man did they hurt.  The top dentures were easier to get accustomed to because I had two implants on the right side of my jaw so it did help anchor the dentures plus since the top dentures have a full plate that serves as a suction, most people don&#x27;t have too many problems with them.  However until I get my dentures permanently set (I get soft relines every few weeks while my gums heal and form) I use a little adhesive on the top denture and I am all set.  The bottom dentures are a different story.  I cannot eat food without adhesive.  I also like adhesive because it helps me to talk clearer and smile.  Bearing in mind that the bottom dentures are not ill fitting but neither are they permanent, I have tried all kinds of adhesives to see what works best.  I found that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder is the best and works for me.  The following are others that I have used and my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Poligrip Cream:  Does not have a good hold and leaves goop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-Poligrip Strips:  Does not hold for long but I do like that it does not leave a bad taste or goop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-Seabond Strips:  Does not hold for long either.  As soon as you eat, the denture comes loose.  However as with Poligrip Strips, it has no bad taste or goop and it is very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;-EZO Strips:  Did not even stay in my mouth after I placed them and held the dentures for 4 minutes.  I had high hopes for this product as I think adhesives are less messier than creams and this adhesive was more sturdier.  Some have had luck with this product but after trying 5 strips and it not working, I just assumed either it did not work for me or I got a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;-Fixodent cream:  Does not have such a great hold and is goopy.&lt;br /&gt;-Secure cream:  This product is a hit or miss for me.  The most aggravating part is trying to find the exact amount to put on the dentures that won&#x27;t ooze out.  If you put too little because you fear it will ooze out and expand then it doesn&#x27;t hold.  If you put too much, it will hold but it tends to ooze out and it is hard to remove with your fingers or a toothbrush.  You have to wait until you remove the denture.  Some like this product a lot and I can certainly see why.  It does have the best holding power of all the above products.&lt;br /&gt;-Cushion Grip:  Heard great things about this but there is no way I am paying over $60 for a tube of adhesive.  That is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we come to Fixodent Extra Hold Powder.  I love it the best.  First of all, if you buy on Amazon (4 a pack) then this is a good deal.  I know that there are many reviews regarding warnings about Zinc and I ignore them.  I think that if Zinc was so dangerous, the FDA would have pulled this product from the shelves.  Dentist all over would NOT recommend this product.  I know of people who have used this product for over 25 years and are still alive and healthy.  I know that some people are allergic to Zinc or can&#x27;t stand the after taste so I can understand if they don&#x27;t want to use this product.  Yes, there is Zinc in this product but unless you plan on ingesting a teaspoon of this powder each day, I think you are safe and the Zinc in Fixodent won&#x27;t upset the Zinc ratio that your body needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because it is easy to use.  It does not have a bad taste for me.  It does not ooze out and by the end of the day, it is easy to remove.  It is one of the few products besides Secure that has allowed me to eat solid food.  I still have to take small bites and chew carefully but I can EAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:  Most people say to sprinkle Fixodent on wet dentures and then get rid of excess (almost like what you do when you flour a piece of chicken).  This works for the upper dentures as they don&#x27;t need much hold; however, I do something different for the bottom that works for me.  I wet the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  I then use a spray bottle and wet the powder but not drench it.  I wet it so that when I place it on my lower gums, the product doesn&#x27;t fall into my mouth.  I hold the dentures in place for 2 to 5 minutes and I won&#x27;t drink or eat for at 30 minutes.  Another way to use the Fixodent powder is to place a thin strip of Fixodent Adhesive Cream on a dry denture and then sprinkle Fixodent Extra Hold Powder on top of the cream (You don&#x27;t have to use Fixodent, you can also use Equate Denture Cream from Walmart which is way cheaper and works as well as Fixodent).  Mist some water on the powder on top, wait a minute and then place in your mouth.  Hold for a minute or two and try not to drink or eat right away.  I do this everyday and I am set for the day and until I get my dentures permanently adjusted this is the product for me.  However, the above products may work for others so I am not saying that they are ineffective, I am just providing an explanation of my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product the best and until proven otherwise, I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I noticed that Fixodent Extra Hold Powder works better with the Walmart cream vs Fixodent cream.  Go figure.  Better for me since Equate is so inexpensive.t the bottom dentures and use quite a bit of powder along the whole length of the denture.  I then use a spray bottle and wet the powder but not drench it.  I wet it so that when I place it on my lower gums, the product doesn&#x27;t fall into my mouth.

            <li> Great stuff. Like Rigident but better. Much cheaper. I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> It is the best adhesive on the market.  Unfortunately that isn&#x27;t saying much.  As with all products of this type, it has a built-in short life.  If these manufacturers want to do us a favor (which I doubt) they would make it longer lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the original stuff; it lasts all day.  Your dentures must fit well to use it.  Why did the stores stop stocking it?  This proves that if something is good, really good, you should buy a lifetime supply before it is discontinued!</li>
            <li> The only one that is not gooey and sticky. Other brands are nasty and feel terrible when taking dentures out or putting them in</li>
            <li> Came quickly, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from a small rural community without a lot of shopping options. I found this to be less expensive from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Dear readers: I have partial dentures for now, and I needed an adhesive for them. First, I bought regular cream, but the goop was too much for me. I hated that everytime, the dentures are removed, there is still the cream stuck to my gums!! I then tried this powder, and I must say that it worked perfectly for two weeks, the I began to notice something wrong with my tongue. After an application of the powder, two hours later my tongue would start to hurt! I first thought that my tongue had to get used to the new application, but after a week of using this product, I now realized that my tongue was allergic to the Zinc! I immediately went back to cream and from there on, I had no more problems. I really feel bad because I really like the easiness of the powder (didn&#x27;t leave gloop when you took out your dentures). I hope that some company will introduce another powder without the Zinc. For now, I will use either the cream or continue with the strips (not that great either). I am not saying that this will happen to anyone, but since it happened to me, I should just give a warning!</li>
            <li> I orded three and paid for three but only got one. I did not get any kind of sales slip with the one I got. What a rip off!!</li>
            <li> My husband prefers this to the other brands because he says it holds better so that is what we buy.</li>
            <li> As new denture wearer, I have experimented with nearly available adhesive and decided that POLIGRIP POWDER is best for me.  Like preparing a cake pan, simply sprinkle powder onto moist dentures and tap dentures to distribute the powder before inverting them to remove excess by tapping again.  I&#x27;m aware that denture adhesive paste outsells any powder which may explain lack of choices and the marketplace&#x27;s slow response to current shortage.  My dentist provided a plastic denture cup (another topic) and sample-sized tube of adhesive, so that was my first experience, and may explain consumer preference.  The sensation of the cold goo oozing within my face, triggered  my gag mechanism..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best experience has been with POLIGRIP POWDER DENTURE ADHESIVE, manufactured in the US by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), a fact that would imply a certain level of stability.  A year ago, I purchased 6 bottles of POLIGRIP from an AMAZON.COM MERCHANT for the convenience and small savings compared to local grocery and chain drug stores.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been unavailable for months due to &amp;#34;raw materials shortage&amp;#34;; and  despite my best efforts, there remains only online sellers that are &amp;#34;scalping&amp;#34; denture adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only became aware of this when attempting to reorder after starting my last bottle, 6-8 weeks supply,  Feeling desperate but not a hundred bucks desperate, and without checking ingredients, I ordered FIXODENT POWDER DENTURE ADHESIVE It is reviewed well enough and nearly double the product costs only slightly more.  If price is the only object, we can stop here.  If performance is important, FIXODENT earns 1 star.  Carefully applied to avoid ingestion, FIXODENT deposited a strong, bitter taste that lingered until I had my first coffee, which caused the lower denture to come loose and release more of the bad taste and swallowed along with the coffee.

            <li> Good Morning, Very good and smart the product, thanks for your service and for your patience and god bles dear frends,</li>
            <li> Dad had used Fasteeth powder on his dentures for years &amp; years, so we&#x27;ve been quite frustrated since we could no longer buy it. I did find it on ebay, but it was all left-over stock, over 2 years old. Yuck. So, when I found this on Amazon, I figured we might as well give it a try. Dad likes it just as well as he ever liked the Fasteeth, &amp; I like the fact that it wasn&#x27;t sitting on a warehouse shelf for 2-4 years!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother when I couldn&#x27;t find it at any store. She loves and relies on this product.</li>
            <li> Thank You for the great service and fast shipment.Great item for thew price.The item is great and has a new customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my moms friend &amp; she is very happy and said she never seen this amount in one box in any store,.</li>
            <li> Adhesive power exceptional. Taste was not too pleasing.</li>
            <li> Used for years - do not like creams - very hard to find this in stores so this bulk buy is great</li>
            <li> not as good as poligrip</li>
            <li> I like the powder better, it last longer too. its neat and easy to use. its worth the money and easy too clean up at night. Its great for trip too</li>
            <li> Seems to hold much better then the clay like substance plus easier to clean up afterwards. Been using for over eight years.</li>
            <li> This adhesive powder is so easy to apply.  I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that holds so well.  I thought I needed to have a reline on my denture.  Don&#x27;t think so now since using this powder.  Takes a little bit of tugging, in fact,  to get it to release my denture when it&#x27;s time to take it out of my mouth.  Great product.  Clean and reliable.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I can laugh without losing my teeth.. Great hold as long as your teeth fit well.</li>
            <li> Good product, can&#x27;t be found in Belize, Which is where I live.</li>
            <li> The automatic orders are all off .just ordered three and a week later received three more a box lasts 1 month so I have a 6 month supply?</li>
            <li> COULD NOT FIND THIS ANYMORE AT KROGER GROCERY WHERE I ALWAYS GOT IT.  WAS GLAD TO FIND IIT HERE. SENT AS QUOTED IT WOULD BE.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my mom.  She was a rigident user,but now it is way way too expensive!!  She said not as strong as rigident, but for the price , it will do.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Not only the best hold but I don&#x27;t have to worry about removing gobs of paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This works great for the uppers and hold all day and through the night. Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Now my lower dentures are more secure and don&#x27;t slip like they did.  I have to learn how much to use, but it is much better and less messy.  There is no oozing out of adhesive which is neater.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dentures for four years now and have tried just about every product, both creams and powders. This is truly the only product that works for me, not only holding the dentures in place all day but doing so comfortably since it has a cushioning effect, allowing me to eat foods with ease that would normally be difficult if not impossible. And at night when I&#x27;m ready to take the dentures out the residue odd very easy to remove as opposed to other products I&#x27;ve tried. Frankly this is the only denture adhesive I can or will use so if that&#x27;s a good recommendation so be it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been wearing dentures for years and would not be without Fixodent Extra Hold. I never have to worry about dentures coming loose no matter what I eat.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for my brother. He likes it a lot and being powder he can stretch the usage a lot longer.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my husband will use.  He swears by it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many denture pastes but I always come back to the Fixodent powder. The powder is less messy, easier to apply, lasts all day and is easier to clean off with an overnight soaking.  I finally descided to just buy the Fixodent powder in quantity from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does the trick as advertized---will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping fast. received as advertised.</li>
            <li> works great as advertized</li>
            <li> Product expires in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I use this powder along with the adhesive I buy at Walmart. Together both give me a hold that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Works great with good fitting denture that needs a little help and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good holding power, long-lasting, and usually easy to remove from mouth and gums.  However, the zinc can cause nausea at times and the taste can be strong at times.</li>
            <li> Bad taste and only holds for about 5 hours !</li>
            <li> Poligrip  super strength is far superior! can we exchange or return for credit?</li>
            <li> I just recently got my upper/lower dentures less than a month ago or so.  I&#x27;m pretty young (34 yrs. old) and destroyed my teeth because of excessive smoking (2 packs a day).  Although I&#x27;m getting used to my dentures right now, I will stand by using this Fixodent adhesive powder over adhesive creams/glues any day.  The cream/glue makes your mouth feel &amp;#34;too full&amp;#34; and by using the powder, not only do the dentures stick better &amp; longer, but they allow the dentures to fit much better and more naturally because there is less &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; in between the gums and the dentures.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wears dentures!  If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li> For my mother-in-law, this has been the best for her dentures instead of the liquid paste.</li>
            <li> Wish they made bigger bottles, wish it was cheaper, but it&#x27;s the preferred brand in our family.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 pack but only got 1 bottle on my second order, after getting only 2 bottles on my first order though I ordered the same 4 pack,&lt;br /&gt;an had to return them both for a refund.</li>
            <li> Thank u this product works great for upper and lower dentures..thank u again</li>
            <li> This powder is good but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as Polident powder did.  Unfortunately, I can  not get Polident Powder anymore.</li>
            <li> Fixodent is a product you can depend on. If your dentures are a bit loose you can use this product. It will hold the dentures.</li>
            <li> Does not hold very long. Maybe max of 4 hours</li>
            <li> Holds better than any... price as gone through the clouds..needs to be more affordable again .  It is not always in stock.</li>
            <li> stays where you put it.  No movement of your dentures.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My mom has used this for years.  It the only product she will buy.  I myself hate the mess of the powder every place!  And the nasty goo.  But I dont use it.  So if it works for her great!  This is really the only place to buy this.  I have looked all over the stores.  It just not available anymore.</li>
            <li> The last thing I ever wanted was a denture in my upper mouth. Unfortunately these things happen. The dentist recommended a tube of paste. I could never get the stuff out. My Mother had the same problem. We were miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does Fixodent powder hold the denture better, it comes out in a strip. We do not end up spending endless time trying to remove little pieces. We love it. Now our dentist recomends it instead of the tube of paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We totally love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;Reduction.  So glad I found this after Poligrip quit making the powder.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different denture adhesives, and this one is the best. It applies easily to wet dentures and holds longer than any I have ever used - and the part is it does not ooze out! All denture wearers need this product ... Fixodent Extra Hold Denture Adhesive Powder</li>
            <li> The best powder. Because the tip is small I can get it right in the groove of the denture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use talcum powder</li>
            <li> This product i bought for my dad is great, he said he can eat his food and not have to worry about his dentures getting loose, he also said the denture last a long time during the day, i will buy again</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Silly to have pulled it from shelves in stores. The air you breath is more dangerous.</li>
            <li> it works okay.. really like a different brand. but this will do in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I recomend this product to all my patients that wear dentures and they have like it very much. it has no taste nor odor, and patients feel more confident wearing they dentures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing available. The only think I don&#x27;t like is the build up of the goo in between meals. But, that may be because my teeth are too loose, so I notice it more.</li>
            <li> The best hold on the market today</li>
            <li> My poor mom has been searching for this product for months!  Each weekly trip to the grocery store came up with the same result - none of her denture powder to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was absolutely thrilled to have this arrive at her door.  No more searching, and no more worrying about keeping her dentures securely fastened.</li>
            <li> This powder will keep my uppers in for 12+ hours through a couple of meals with no problems. Lowers on the other hand, tend to come out after a meal, unless I also use a little bit of cream in addition to the powder. I have found that the cheap equate stuff will do the job. It doesn&#x27;t take much. Of course, eating and drinking dairy products will always loosen them up no matter what, and that includes things containing milk chocolate. In fact I eat yogurt before taking them out. Works like a charm. The main advantage here is the amount you get for how much you pay. I am currently spending half of what I use to spend on creams alone. The trick I learned from a YouTube video is the fold a crease into sheet of paper, open it back up, and lay it on the counter. Dry your plate first before just wetting the inside of it with your finger. Sprinkle the powder on the wet part of the plate, and then pour the excess onto the paper. Pop the top of the bottle off with your finger (it will come off!). Pour powder back into the bottle using the crease in the paper as a sort of funnel. Pop the top back on the bottle  before screwing the cap back on. No muss, no fuss!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great</li>
            <li> good price&lt;br /&gt;used some of my gift card from my son</li>
            <li> great price for 4 bottles!</li>
            <li> Bought this for husband&#x27;s dentures and he loves it.  It&#x27;s much, much better than the gels or pastes he used to use and holds very securely, and you only have to use a slight dusting of the power on the denture.  I expect this will last a long time.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy shopping to help my dad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I actually love it but I like it better than any denture adhesive I have tried. I prefer the powder to the cream because it doesn&#x27;t leave the goo that creams leave when you take your dentures out. I highly recommend the powder.</li>
            <li> Fixodent is the best adhesive available for dentures, use it longer than 36 years daily.&lt;br /&gt;STRONGLY recommended. Pieter Groen</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in the powder on the public market anymore, so I order it on the internet.  It is the only product that really holds my dentures in place.  I feel I MUST have this on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works but my grandma loves it. So, if my grandma loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few days but it is more comfortable and there is no residual mess when the dentures are taken out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend per recommendation from dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years - it does a great job - wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> great price and service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fixodent Extra Hold Denture Adhesive Powder for yearsIits the only adhesive I will use. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do so you won&#x27;t use any other adhesive again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.K Tucson:</li>
            <li> my dad loves this stuff</li>
