            <li>Thanks DIANE COMB!!!!</li>
            <li>love that it is unbreakable and it rakes through my hair easily ....</li>
            <li>On my curly, coily hair it works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is great if your looking for a good wide tooth comb that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair!</li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating it is perfect for wet hair</li>
            <li>This is the best wide tooth comb I have ever owned</li>
            <li>Cleans very easily with liquid soap and hot water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HUGE.  </li>
            <li>Its huge.</li>
            <li>and there is no breakage with this comb because smooth</li>
            <li>I have a purple one and it has a shine when the light hits it.</li>
            <li>And is smooth</li>
            <li>This comb is thee absolute BOMB!!</li>
            <li>I have an over the shower bottle caddy and the hole in the handle fits right on over the hook to hang it up when not in use.</li>
            <li>I give it a four star because it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault that I didn&#x27;t get the right width, but to me it&#x27;s just</li>
            <li>Very large though</li>
            <li>This is a   whopper of a comb - large!</li>
            <li>this is a great comb for detangling thick curly hair like mine ....</li>
            <li>This comb is so much more bigger than it looked in the picture!</li>
            <li>The price is excellent so there&#x27;s no need going out to waist money on a expensive comb that may not work and just damage your hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s big and has wide teeth making it great for detangling hair.</li>
            <li>It is a large comb, but did not look that large on the picture, however, it is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Great for detangling when wet or dry combing.</li>
            <li>Great for very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both of curly hair and wide toothed combs are better to reduce friz.</li>
            <li>I like the size because it allows you to gently comb the hair without breakage unless of course your hair is breaking to the touch</li>
            <li>so very we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>I got this comb to help when I put Almond Oil in my hair to give it that extra smooth silky look &amp; feel.  </li>
            <li>I am not always a fan of combs and some of them can really do a number on your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent comb</li>
            <li>and id highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I love using when my hair is wet ad pretty much any other time.</li>
            <li>and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>I found an added benefit with the handle for easy grip and a thick smooth back for smoothing the roots of relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the plastic material on the comb started peeling after a few uses, but other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good comb.</li>
            <li>It works great and since the teeth are far apart it tends to pull less hair out than the pick I usually use.</li>
            <li>People with shoulder length or shorter hair -   or very fine/thin hair have no need for such   a hefty comb.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and the comb works really well,</li>
            <li>This comb is amazing and under half the price for the ones I usually go for.</li>
            <li>particular comb is big, really BIG: not convenient for a purse or a suitcase, it&#x27;s designed to be used at home in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>and I think it would be better suited for those with long and/or thick hair.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, overall very strong comb for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>The prongs are pretty pointy, so if you&#x27;re tender-headed use a little caution in wielding this device!</li>

            <li> yes, that long.  </li>
            <li> I wrapped a long rubber band around the handle</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my my thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very long comb</li>
            <li> Made out of some darn tough plastic, I always break combs in my hair the first week I get them</li>
            <li> Needed an oversize wide tooth comb for my long, course, wavy hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> I wish I got a different color other than black</li>
            <li> not what I expected...</li>
            <li> I will keep using this comb but wanted to let others know that the teeth are really wide apart from what it appeared to be.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone with thick, long, curly hair!</li>
            <li> the points aren&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li> This comb is like any other comb.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo26WNOYAEJM2DG]]The comb I received is black and the teeth on it are spread wide apart, well take a look at the video</li>
            <li> Okay HATE</li>
            <li> The material is extremely sturdy and shows no sign of breaking ever!</li>
            <li> But as the color goes (I could&#x27;nt care any less about looks or color)</li>
            <li> I have less hair loss since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> This is not the type of comb you might use to evenly pull conditioner through the strands of your hair: thick hair, long hair, curly hair---that&#x27;s what calls for a comb like this.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long   (think Rapunzel) ...</li>
            <li> I recommend it a friend who has long thick hair .</li>
            <li> And it can be hung as it has a little hole in the handle.</li>
            <li> I notice at least 70% less hair wrapped around the   comb after a comb-thru after conditioner</li>
            <li> This is not a LOVE</li>
            <li> Goody combs seem small to me and too flexible.   </li>
            <li> No more hair pulling which it works.</li>
            <li> its a dull 70&#x27;s orange brown color.</li>
            <li> (you   know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> I hated getting my long wet hair detangled as a child, and nothing&#x27;s changed!</li>
            <li> Very thick plastic and</li>
            <li> this   awful rusty/orangey/faded almost tan but too   orange to be tan color - but who cares (that much).   </li>
            <li> Mine (sadly) is neither</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s length it was difficult for me to keep a grip on it.  </li>
            <li> Plastic wrap around the comb started to peel, now it looks bad.</li>
            <li> HATE HATE the color</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a great comb for detangling thick curly hair like mine .... love that it is unbreakable and it rakes through my hair easily ....</li>
            <li> Plastic wrap around the comb started to peel, now it looks bad.</li>
            <li> I hated getting my long wet hair detangled as a child, and nothing&#x27;s changed! A big wide-tooth comb is a must-have for me, it prevents me from tugging at my tangles and pulling out my hair in frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular comb is big, really BIG: not convenient for a purse or a suitcase, it&#x27;s designed to be used at home in or out of the shower. This is not the type of comb you might use to evenly pull conditioner through the strands of your hair: thick hair, long hair, curly hair---that&#x27;s what calls for a comb like this. The prongs are pretty pointy, so if you&#x27;re tender-headed use a little caution in wielding this device!</li>
            <li> Great for detangling when wet or dry combing. I love this comb ordered another for on the go.</li>
            <li> This add is deceiving. It illustrates 2 combs, but you only receive one.</li>
            <li> I like the comb since it seems to be well made. Very thick plastic and the points aren&#x27;t sharp.  Very large though; I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the description. I keep it in my shower to use with my conditioner so it works for that purpose</li>
            <li> great great great - i use these last when doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair. My daughter and I both of curly hair and wide toothed combs are better to reduce friz. Very big comb but we have two and use them instead of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. My hair is thick and long   (think Rapunzel) ... yes, that long.  This is a   whopper of a comb - large! And sturdy!  Just   what I wanted for the shower after conditioner.   IF there are any seams, I can&#x27;t find them.    This is not a LOVE YOUR scalp comb... it&#x27;s not   for massage or anything - but if you have seriously   long (white chick) hair - this comb is for you.   Goody combs seem small to me and too flexible.   I&#x27;ve even had a Goody comb break on me. \\&quot;snap!\\&quot; -   NOT this comb.  Okay HATE HATE HATE the color this   awful rusty/orangey/faded almost tan but too   orange to be tan color - but who cares (that much).   It&#x27;s a great comb that feels very very   substantial in the hand.  It&#x27;s too big to lose   and I love that part the most!  I&#x27;m trying to   grow my hair even longer and with this comb   I notice at least 70% less hair wrapped around the   comb after a comb-thru after conditioner (you   know what I mean).  So buy it and don&#x27;t say I   never did you a favor.      People with shoulder length or shorter hair -   or very fine/thin hair have no need for such   a hefty comb.  BUT I DO!     Thanks DIANE COMB!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this comb. Just wish it was a little smaller so i can carry in my purse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very long comb and I think it would be better suited for those with long and/or thick hair.  Mine (sadly) is neither so I&#x27;ll be paying-this-forward to someone who may get more use from it.  Because of it&#x27;s length it was difficult for me to keep a grip on it.  I wrapped a long rubber band around the handle so I wouldn&#x27;t keep dropping it in the shower.</li>
            <li> No surprises here folks. It&#x27;s a comb, that combs. And it can be hung as it has a little hole in the handle. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> What a biiiiig comb and sturdy too. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It work ok during the shower after I shampoo and condictioning my hair. No more hair pulling which it works. I recommend it a friend who has long thick hair .</li>
            <li> WOW! This comb is amazing and under half the price for the ones I usually go for. Made out of some darn tough plastic, I always break combs in my hair the first week I get them but this one will never break because of my hair.Love it. Definatly not junk and id highly recommend it... But as the color goes (I could&#x27;nt care any less about looks or color) its a dull 70&#x27;s orange brown color.</li>
            <li> Got a perm so I needed a wide-tooth comb. Works great, no complaints. Sturdy stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this comb in the shower to comb Renpure Coconut (a Wen-type product) through my hair. I also started using it for my conditioner as well when I use a regular shampoo and conditioner. It works great and since the teeth are far apart it tends to pull less hair out than the pick I usually use.</li>
            <li> This is great if your looking for a good wide tooth comb that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair! I love using when my hair is wet ad pretty much any other time.</li>
            <li> Always read before purchasing. I thought I was getting 2 as in the picture posted. But other than that, overall very strong comb for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating it is perfect for wet hair it detangles and there is no breakage with this comb because smooth and it does not strip I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now and it still looks new. I found an added benefit with the handle for easy grip and a thick smooth back for smoothing the roots of relaxed hair. I love the color and design I have a purple one and it has a shine when the light hits it. Plus it has a hole at the bottom for hanging it up for storage. I like the size because it allows you to gently comb the hair without breakage unless of course your hair is breaking to the touch but this comb does not cause breakage at all. This is the best wide tooth comb I have ever owned and I would never replace it and I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s that durable</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo26WNOYAEJM2DG]]The comb I received is black and the teeth on it are spread wide apart, well take a look at the video and you will see what you will get. It is not what I wanted but it will do, so I will keep it.&lt;br /&gt;The company decides which color you will receive so don&#x27;t expect the coral one shown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent comb it&#x27;s big and has wide teeth making it great for detangling hair. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the plastic material on the comb started peeling after a few uses, but other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good comb.</li>
            <li> Needed an oversize wide tooth comb for my long, course, wavy hair in the shower.  I use the comb when the conditioner is in my hair and can either hold the handle or head to rake it through my tresses.  No chance of breaking this baby.  It&#x27;s HUGE.  I have an over the shower bottle caddy and the hole in the handle fits right on over the hook to hang it up when not in use.</li>
            <li> This comb is thee absolute BOMB!! It detangles so very we&#x27;ll. I&#x27;ll definely have this in my holy grail of products. Amazing comb. I wish I got a different color other than black but it&#x27;s still amazing. I will order again!!!</li>
            <li> not what I expected...I gave it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected. Great for very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I got this comb to help when I put Almond Oil in my hair to give it that extra smooth silky look &amp; feel.  I have long hair and the comb works really well, but I really only needed just a tad bit smaller width between teeth.  I will keep using this comb but wanted to let others know that the teeth are really wide apart from what it appeared to be.  I give it a four star because it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault that I didn&#x27;t get the right width, but to me it&#x27;s just okay!  3 stars</li>
            <li> I received this item today and I&#x27;m totally in love with it. This comb is so much more bigger than it looked in the picture! The material is extremely sturdy and shows no sign of breaking ever! I definitely recommend this to anyone with thick, long, curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this comb. Its huge. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Great for people with curly hair. I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I needed a big comb to comb out my hair,especially after shampooing because it get so tangled.  It is a large comb, but did not look that large on the picture, however, it is just what I needed.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great for combing fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, in spite of the picture, this include ONE comb, not two.</li>
            <li> I am not always a fan of combs and some of them can really do a number on your hair. This one however has been the most gentile comb I&#x27;ve ever used. You still need to use it from tip to root but it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull on your hair when using. On my curly, coily hair it works best on dry hair. It&#x27;s also very strong and durable. Cleans very easily with liquid soap and hot water. The price is excellent so there&#x27;s no need going out to waist money on a expensive comb that may not work and just damage your hair. I think this brush is best suited for anyone with a curly or wavy hair pattern. Definitely a good comb to add into your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Love this comb.  I have less hair loss since I purchased it.  My mother is asking to use now aswell.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with this product.Works very well for my my thick and long hair.Gets out tangles which i like.</li>
            <li> This comb is like any other comb. I used it when I was shampooing my hair and it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I received this comb. It is great and completes its job. Seems to have a sturdy handle. And is smooth</li>
