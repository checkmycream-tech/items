            <li>I&#x27;ve heard for some people they love it, for others it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and how shimmery they are.</li>
            <li>This Palette is a must-have for those who love these colors and&lt;br /&gt;want to learn or know how to work them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this eye make up.  </li>
            <li>Well worth $30!!</li>
            <li>This product arrived safe and sound &amp; I am so excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>it is so fantastic and love how versatile the pallette is.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I guess that shows I used it a lot :) You will really like this product!</li>
            <li>really rich looking and feeling eye shadows and</li>
            <li>Very nice colours , loved it, but its smaller than I  expected , .so..</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for eye shadow that is going to have full, bold color...</li>
            <li>Overall, I am loving this palette, and I will probably buy it again when it runs out, if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>the pallet gives you a lot of different combinations and choices  looks nice</li>
            <li>This palette displays subtle, beautiful color with some shimmer that draws plenty of attention to your eyes.</li>
            <li>I am sure this will last me over a year, and I do not anticipate it breaking.</li>
            <li>This was the first Sephora product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>You can make many different looks with this set.</li>
            <li>[ But when i got it, of course..the exact color i wanted to use was in shambles.</li>
            <li>It has many different colors</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to you and all my friends and family!</li>
            <li>The compact itself is very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, but useless.</li>
            <li>You can go from daytime to night time all in the same palette, it&#x27;s honestly better than the naked palette!!</li>
            <li>I was able to give it a first test on a bride for her wedding this past weekend, and all I can saw is WOW!</li>
            <li>I have tons of eyeshadow palettes in different brands, but these baked eyeshadow&#x27;s from Sephora are definitely my favorites right now!</li>
            <li>Soft and shimmery</li>
            <li>Too much fallout of glitter particles... and not enough color pigment.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m too old to be wearing glitter.</li>
            <li>The dark brown ones are lightly shimmered and the plum one is not as heavy as the rest, and then the rest of the colors are highly shimmery.</li>

            <li> The only down side is there is a lot of fallout (which is to be expected with shadows so shimmery)</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have received other eyeshadow palettes before that were not well packaged at all and arrived at my door in shambles.  </li>
            <li> i have alot eyeshadow from other product like covergirl..</li>
            <li> PICKS UP NICELY ON DARK SKIN</li>
            <li> I did not know these would not be typical shadow.</li>
            <li> I was  a little bit desapointed</li>
            <li> and when you put the pigment on your brush, it gets in the space between each shadow, so it can get quite messy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed in is it did not last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> so you have a few to pick from.</li>
            <li> The colors are hard to use due to the type.</li>
            <li> AND I AM CHOCOLATE DARK!!!</li>
            <li> Not good for brushes.</li>
            <li> You put it on your brush, there&#x27;s hardly ant color, and once i hits your eye, there&#x27;s virtually no color - if anything visible at all!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is useless.</li>

            <li> The colors are hard to use due to the type. I did not know these would not be typical shadow. Not good for brushes.</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Sephora&#x27;s site, and I really love this palette. The colors range from light shimmer to glitter galore! The dark brown ones are lightly shimmered and the plum one is not as heavy as the rest, and then the rest of the colors are highly shimmery. So if you don&#x27;t like shimmer, this palette is not for you. It comes packaged nicely, and the colors are great. It&#x27;s awesome because it comes with a highlight, crease, outer V, and lid colors, so you can do so many looks with just this one palette. The only down side is there is a lot of fallout (which is to be expected with shadows so shimmery) and when you put the pigment on your brush, it gets in the space between each shadow, so it can get quite messy. Overall, I am loving this palette, and I will probably buy it again when it runs out, if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. The nude colours are really nice with matte and shimmer colours.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The colors are beautiful, so happy with my purchase! I was able to give it a first test on a bride for her wedding this past weekend, and all I can saw is WOW!</li>
            <li> BEST EYE SHADOW COMBO EVER! Well worth $30!! You can go from daytime to night time all in the same palette, it&#x27;s honestly better than the naked palette!! I highly recommend this to you and all my friends and family! It&#x27;s amazing :)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I love this eye shadow it is so fantastic and love how versatile the pallette is. I can make it into a bronzer when I don&#x27;t have some with a mix of some of the palette.</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this palette!  Soft and shimmery - they are the perfect compliment to just about any skin tone!</li>
            <li> fabulous shades!!! love love love. not too glittery. nice and fresh with a perfect hint of shimmer. Shimmer not glitter!</li>
            <li> This product was so well packaged. I have received other eyeshadow palettes before that were not well packaged at all and arrived at my door in shambles.  This product arrived safe and sound &amp; I am so excited to try it!  :)</li>
            <li> i like this product...i have alot eyeshadow from other product like covergirl..stuff but i like this one&lt;br /&gt;it doent have alot powder so when you wear this make up it look nice</li>
            <li> Very nice colours , loved it, but its smaller than I  expected , .so.. I was  a little bit desapointed</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is useless. I&#x27;ve heard for some people they love it, for others it doesn&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;m an \\&quot;other\\&quot; (not like on LOST). There is almost NO color payoff. You put it on your brush, there&#x27;s hardly ant color, and once i hits your eye, there&#x27;s virtually no color - if anything visible at all! I was so looking forward to this palette. It&#x27;s beautiful, but useless.</li>
            <li> Since I have received this product, I have loved it! I have not had any problems with it showing up on my eyes. If you are in the market for eye shadow that is going to have full, bold color... this palette is not for you. This palette displays subtle, beautiful color with some shimmer that draws plenty of attention to your eyes. I have only had it for a week and every time I have worn it I have had someone compliment my eye makeup and ask me what brand it was. The compact itself is very well made and sturdy. I am sure this will last me over a year, and I do not anticipate it breaking. It also gives me plenty of different options in color and value(shade), so I can use it for any time of day or mood I am in. The palette is also refillable, which is awesome! Money well spent.</li>
            <li> This was the first Sephora product I have ever tried. I asked for this collection for Christmas and was very impressed! I love the colors and how shimmery they are. You can make many different looks with this set. The only thing I was disappointed in is it did not last as long as I had hoped. Three months later, and I am already out of 3 colors. I guess that shows I used it a lot :) You will really like this product!</li>
            <li> Too much fallout of glitter particles... and not enough color pigment. The case is attractive but I also don&#x27;t like the shadow pots.</li>
            <li> really rich looking and feeling eye shadows and the pallet gives you a lot of different combinations and choices  looks nice</li>
            <li> give to my grandaughter as a Christmas Gift.  She loved them.  Nice muted colors.  Not to bright fo a teenager.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even gotten to try the colors yet. :[ But when i got it, of course..the exact color i wanted to use was in shambles. Needs to be packed better! Sending back.</li>
            <li> This Palette is a must-have for those who love these colors and&lt;br /&gt;want to learn or know how to work them.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient compact, color pigmented wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased...</li>
            <li> I love this nude palette! The colors are so beautiful and shimmery! I also ordered the \\&quot;in the dark\\&quot; palette. I have tons of eyeshadow palettes in different brands, but these baked eyeshadow&#x27;s from Sephora are definitely my favorites right now!</li>
            <li> I love this eye make up.  It has many different colors so you have a few to pick from. Love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it had a bit of glitter in it. I like it but I&#x27;m too old to be wearing glitter.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect. Beautiful colors</li>
            <li> LOVELY COLORS, STAY ALL DAY!!! SHIMMER AND SHINE!! PICKS UP NICELY ON DARK SKIN AND I AM CHOCOLATE DARK!!! GO OUT AND BUY LADIES OF EVERY SHADE.</li>
