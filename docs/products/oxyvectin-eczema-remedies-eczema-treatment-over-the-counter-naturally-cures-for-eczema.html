            <li>and it&#x27;s an excellent face cream.</li>
            <li>The best I can seem to do for Excezema is to use the tar shampoo for horses and dogs.</li>
            <li>It is a very good cream, it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals and is an excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li>I will probably order more because although it is not a cure for eczema, it relieves a lot of the uncomfortableness..</li>
            <li>I might have gotten better results.  </li>
            <li>After some research it made sense when I read that it might be better to cleanse the body of the toxins that are causing this condition, kinda like attacking the source instead of trying to cover it up.</li>
            <li>and my skin began to peel off and new beautiful skin was growing beneath</li>
            <li>That bottle finished about 2 weeks ago, and things were pretty good until I did some work on a car</li>
            <li>I stopped using my cream medication to see exactly what the Oxyvectin would do on its own</li>
            <li>Great product, recommend to anyone  trying  to get eczema  out of their  internal  body system.</li>
            <li>Today my hands are eczema free</li>
            <li>(solution is smelly but very powerful).  </li>
            <li>I have taken this pretty faithfully and have noticed a significant change for the better in my skin.</li>
            <li>I had significant results after taking 2 capsules twice a day for 2 weeks-</li>
            <li>I used a full bottle of this product</li>
            <li>She mixed some creoline and water (kind of a runny-brown-colored solution) and told me to apply it to the affected area 2x or 3x per day using a q-tip soaked in that solution</li>
            <li>; today I am eczema free in my hands (first in 3 years) and I am about to tell you exactly how I accomplished</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to be cheap, get you a bottle of this product and a bottle of creoline (which is like $12 here in amazon) and get rid of your eczema for less than $40. 5 stars because I am happy that rash is finally gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found something that helps my skin.</li>
            <li>It made my itching unbearably intense!</li>
            <li>After the bottle ran out, the eczema returned, so it must have had some positive effect.  </li>
            <li>First I wanna say that I am a real person this is not a plug or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised how well this stuff works and how quickly.</li>
            <li>Please include a disclaimer in your description so no one else wastes their money on a product they cannot use safely!</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t need the cream.  </li>
            <li>I finished two bottles of these but didn&#x27;t help me so much to get rid of my skin problem although I&#x27;m using this together with anti eczema cream.</li>
            <li>got something that really works.</li>
            <li>However, mine is most likely caused by allergies and even when I get rid of it, it keeps coming back.</li>
            <li>I have had eczema in my hands for years and seen three different dermatologists and all keep prescribing me many different steroid creams (the strongest one being Vanos).</li>
            <li>I can say that after a few days, my eczema was getting better.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love this stuff and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>Since the first application the affected area felt a little bit sensitive since the first application, and it wasn&#x27;t but 3 days</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already started noticing my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I found this stuff, it says it&#x27;s all natural with no side effects, so I got a bottle.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m willing to take these pills for as long as it takes to get rid of it or get it under control.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s glad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that lives in south america come and visit my parents, and my aunt saw the eczema in my hands and all she did was make me a small bottle and of a solution called &amp;#34;Creoline&amp;#34;, yes Creoline (which amazon sells for cheap by the way).</li>
            <li>and then it will peel off on its own or when you bathe (DO NOT peel it yourself, if you peel it and there is at least a little bit of blood or open wound</li>
            <li>I started seeing and feeling a difference within the first week, by the third i didnt feel anything odd or any side effects.</li>

            <li> And since no one knows how eczema comes about, or what can trigger it in each individual person, it can be hard to find something that really helps.</li>
            <li> a few day&#x27;s ago and now my forearms are starting to itch and the bumps are starting to appear.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning the product for a partial refund.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this medication for the past few days</li>
            <li> I started to have really bad flareups that my ointment didn&#x27;t seem to be treating very well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the combination of the two or either one did it</li>

            <li> It is a very good cream, it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals and is an excellent moisturizer and it probably does help the dermatitis/ecxzema. However, mine is most likely caused by allergies and even when I get rid of it, it keeps coming back. I will continue to use the cream however, because I think it does help and it&#x27;s an excellent face cream.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommend to anyone  trying  to get eczema  out of their  internal  body system.</li>
            <li> save your money. I saw no improvement from my month of use.</li>
            <li> I have taken this pretty faithfully and have noticed a significant change for the better in my skin. I will probably order more because although it is not a cure for eczema, it relieves a lot of the uncomfortableness..</li>
            <li> appears to be helping, still in the observation phase.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema in my hands for years and seen three different dermatologists and all keep prescribing me many different steroid creams (the strongest one being Vanos). My dermatologist said that hand eczema is common on people who had eczema as a child (that&#x27;s me).  I used a full bottle of this product and I noticed a small progress but not enough by itself as i was first expecting (unsure if it was the product or not); today I am eczema free in my hands (first in 3 years) and I am about to tell you exactly how I accomplished it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a relative (my aunt) that lives in south america come and visit my parents, and my aunt saw the eczema in my hands and all she did was make me a small bottle and of a solution called &amp;#34;Creoline&amp;#34;, yes Creoline (which amazon sells for cheap by the way). She mixed some creoline and water (kind of a runny-brown-colored solution) and told me to apply it to the affected area 2x or 3x per day using a q-tip soaked in that solution (solution is smelly but very powerful).  She also said that my skin was going to turn to a dark brown color because the product itself is maroon-colored.  Since the first application the affected area felt a little bit sensitive since the first application, and it wasn&#x27;t but 3 days and my skin began to peel off and new beautiful skin was growing beneath (expect the bad skin to dry/harden and then it will peel off on its own or when you bathe (DO NOT peel it yourself, if you peel it and there is at least a little bit of blood or open wound you have to start over again that area).  I discontinued using the solution a few days after I started it and within a week the eczema began to show again, so this time &amp;#34;I declared a war to eczema&amp;#34; with that Creoline solution and applied it 3x or 4x per day for almost 10 days and that was what made it happen (at the same time I was taking pills from the second bottle of the product listed on this page).  Today my hands are eczema free and i have stoppedusing the creoline and these pills and no eczema so far (although i keep hydrating my hands like crazy all day long) but no eczema back and it has been almost a month now since I stopped both treatments. I am not sure if the combination of the two or either one did it but I am thankful that that eczema is now gone. Don&#x27;t try to be cheap, get you a bottle of this product and a bottle of creoline (which is like $12 here in amazon) and get rid of your eczema for less than $40. 5 stars because I am happy that rash is finally gone. Don&#x27;t forget to hydrate with hand lotions multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> I been using this for 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t notice a difference yet. A lot of the reviews say 30 days.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical of this stuff prior to purchasing.  I can say that after a few days, my eczema was getting better.  It never totally disappeared though.  Maybe if I upped the dosage (I only took one caplet 2 times daily) I might have gotten better results.  I stopped using my cream medication to see exactly what the Oxyvectin would do on its own and I have to admit, I really didn&#x27;t need the cream.  After the bottle ran out, the eczema returned, so it must have had some positive effect.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I finished two bottles of these but didn&#x27;t help me so much to get rid of my skin problem although I&#x27;m using this together with anti eczema cream.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. We&#x27;re still at square one where we started and don&#x27;t know what to try next</li>
            <li> I still feel the same, itching like crazy....I still feel the same, itching like crazy.....I still feel the same, itching like crazy</li>
            <li> First I wanna say that I am a real person this is not a plug or anything like that. I have been an amazon customer for almost 2 years, I do think amazon is the sh!t yet I have never made a review on any products, it&#x27;s just not my thing to b!tch or boast about what I buy. But, I have had eczema for about a year and a half, the cream the doc gave me worked a little but I tried not to use it a lot cuz I didn&#x27;t like the idea of a topical steroid, and the sh!t kept coming back after each application anyway. After some research it made sense when I read that it might be better to cleanse the body of the toxins that are causing this condition, kinda like attacking the source instead of trying to cover it up. In my case this sh!itty rash is usually triggered when I work on cars (Which is weird cuz I&#x27;ve been working on cars practically all my life.) or get really dirty working, let water sit on my skin, or get really stressed out. I found this stuff, it says it&#x27;s all natural with no side effects, so I got a bottle. I started seeing and feeling a difference within the first week, by the third i didnt feel anything odd or any side effects. That bottle finished about 2 weeks ago, and things were pretty good until I did some work on a car a few day&#x27;s ago and now my forearms are starting to itch and the bumps are starting to appear. Personally, I&#x27;m willing to take these pills for as long as it takes to get rid of it or get it under control. And since no one knows how eczema comes about, or what can trigger it in each individual person, it can be hard to find something that really helps. If you have eczema then you know how uncomfortable it is, and if nothing else works for you, try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised how well this stuff works and how quickly. I started to have really bad flareups that my ointment didn&#x27;t seem to be treating very well. I&#x27;ve been taking this medication for the past few days and I&#x27;ve already started noticing my skin clear up. I&#x27;ve been using my dermatologist prescribed ointment as well as the bottle recommends combining it with any lotion you&#x27;re using. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found something that helps my skin. The only bad thing I can say is that the pills themselves are a little stinky and taste a little like fish oil. Other than that I love this stuff and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I had significant results after taking 2 capsules twice a day for 2 weeks- no more itching,redness or burning.  I am continuing to take it (2 caps am and 1 cap PM) because I still have some flaking skin although not as bad as before.  I recommended this to my neighbor who asked me to order this for him and he has seen improvement.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning the product for a partial refund.  I tried the pills for about 3 weeks.  No change in my skin condition.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Well of all the reviews I read I was hoping. Just finished the bottle and no results from here. The best I can seem to do for Excezema is to use the tar shampoo for horses and dogs. That is about all that seems to work. BTW the pills smell of fish oil which I already take...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DIDNT WORK!! I M NOT HAPPY WITH IT AT ALL, I HAVE TAKE MY SON TO HIS DOCTOR FOR HIS ECZEMA OUT BREAK.!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s glad.&lt;br /&gt;I got something that really works.</li>
            <li> i havent had any change after about 3 weeks of taking this product twice a day. the fish oil taste is horrible!</li>
            <li> Oxyvectin contains Butterbur extract which is in the same family as Ragweed. It made my itching unbearably intense! Please include a disclaimer in your description so no one else wastes their money on a product they cannot use safely!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how, but taking Oxyvectin seems to help with my symtoms of Eczema.  I take one capsule in the morning with water, before anything else, and one in the evening, before dinner.  One order is about to be used up and I am about to order a refill.</li>
