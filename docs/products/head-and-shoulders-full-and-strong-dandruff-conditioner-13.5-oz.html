            <li>awesome price and great product!</li>
            <li>Worked great on my hairy shoulders!</li>
            <li>This conditioner isn&#x27;t very good for untangling knots, which increases the chance of breakage as I attempt to remove them.  </li>
            <li>This worked beautifully -</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>Great item, works well.</li>
            <li>, this is a great one to try.</li>
            <li>i smell great too.</li>
            <li>Great companion to [[ASIN:B001EIRRXU Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo Citrus Breeze 23.7 oz.</li>
            <li>It did not do a great job as a conditioner of my hair type.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is great for all hair types as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Works great on the dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I have always heard that Head and Shoulders is great for anyone, because it makes your hair so nice.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a good job with controlling dandruff used with the brand&#x27;s shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Like all the Head &amp; Shoulders conditioners, this one is luxurious in thickness, smells great, rinses clean (with ease) and leaves GORGEOUS hair.</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>The results with my hair were excellent, it gave me nice soft bouncy hair with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>A number of years ago, he&#x27;d tried the shampoo and conditioner in one, and hadn&#x27;t liked the smell (nor did I).</li>
            <li>He likes to rotate out his shampoos and has commented on how nicely this version of Head and Shoulders has worked for him.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and is conditioning</li>
            <li>He liked that the scent was not floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He does like the scent which he finds pleasant but not overpowering, and said that he will get this one over the original one from now on.</li>
            <li>complementary conditioner also has a nice scent, and leaves hair looking like it had more volume.</li>
            <li>This is a good, secure lid.)</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is (by far) the best line for dandruff treatment that there is.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, many dandruff controlling products do not smell great.  </li>
            <li>What I noticed and liked was the excellent detangling properties that were left over.</li>
            <li>when used without a dandruff shampoo first, it still does a great job keeping dandruff at bay and keeping my scalp from feeling itchy.</li>
            <li>This is a pleasant smelling light conditioner that leaves hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have known many people who use Head &amp; Shoulders products and love them, this conditioner was not a hit with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than checking my  hair twice a day to see if I washed the conditioner out and worrying about it.</li>
            <li>i just feel so much better when i use head and shoulders products every week in the shower.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this conditioner, and it makes my hair a bit softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>While these products seem somewhat synonymous with \\&quot;men,\\&quot; they are just phenomenal for women&#x27;s hair as well (and, I know that P&amp;G has been trying to change the perception of Head and Shoulders as a men&#x27;s product).    </li>
            <li>These days they offer many 2 in 1 productucts like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be sure  </li>
            <li>his hair was much sleeker and he was happy since he wasn&#x27;t scratching.  </li>
            <li>, it works OK with me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been awhile since Head and Shoulders made a conditioner, so I&#x27;m glad to see it return to the shelves.</li>
            <li>This Head and Shoulders conditioner works well in conjunction with the T-Gel shampoo, and helps to cover the stench with a more pleasurable scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Especially great during the winter, and you only need to use it about 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>Also, he points out that the shampoo volume is greater than the conditioner volume.</li>
            <li>, it conditions well, but most of all, it leaves any flakes on my scalp at bay.</li>
            <li>This will be a product I will buy again but probably with the shampoo since I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>The Full &amp; Strong conditioner is a good partner with its shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too - fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>The new incarnations of Head and Shoulders are sure surprising</li>
            <li>is a nice fragrance, rather unisex, just fresh and clean, mostly fruity.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is healthy and clean and am seeing regrowth</li>
            <li>I tried this, and found that it left my hair looking great with more volume.  </li>
            <li>I felt the smell was too strong but not in a distracting way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately strong out of the bottle, but it dries fainter-</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a pleasant smell and makes my husband&#x27;s hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a girl, Head and Shoulders makes  great girly fragrance too - the Apple one - if you&#x27;re looking for a dandruff shampoo that actually smells lady-like.</li>
            <li>It does a terrific job of moisturizing my hair leaving it look great and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is not watery or drippy, it&#x27;s a nice thickness and smooths on my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>(I always have to worry about my cats knocking mine over and it spilling if it isn&#x27;t secure.  </li>
            <li>As such, I was happy to see this H&amp;S that works to protect against split ends yet still takes care of itchy scalp (which causes the dandruff).  </li>
            <li>I really like how well it works on its own, since it lets me use shampoos meant for my color treated hair but still have something to help with my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have all the full and strong products and get compliments on my baby fine hair because it now looks fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily and leaves my hair feeling full.  </li>
            <li>My husband used this in conjunction with the Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, they are in check with the new version of nicely scented H &amp; S shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This works great for him, and he says it helps keeps his head from feeling itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and pleasant smelling as Pantene, but the trade off is fine since it helps some with the dandruff and still smells decent.</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize well or replenish the hair, so that it looks and feels so much healthier and better</li>
            <li>it just leaves it really clean and super well conditioned.    </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get the full benefits</li>
            <li>I haven’t noticed it making my hair stronger, as the product description claims, but then my hair is pretty strong to begin with.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner has a great scent with a rich, thick, silky consistency.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find that not only did it not make my hair more oily, it actually seemed to keep the oil from building up quite as quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is so much better than the old scent that Head and Shoulders had.</li>
            <li>husband doesn&#x27;t love the scent for a man, but it isn&#x27;t strong once the hair is dry, so it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll keep using here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sometimes get dandruff in the winter when it&#x27;s dry, so I kind of use this like a conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells nice and it leave his hair light and fluffy, without being frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice light, clean scent and is pretty thick.</li>
            <li>it just leaves hair fresh if you stick your nose in it or get very close.  </li>
            <li>is a big bottle with a flip top lid.  </li>
            <li>; was the first comment I got tossed out to me from the shower.</li>
            <li>I was worried using the first time that it would only make my hair more oily -</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, a lot of it, and just enough natural curl that it&#x27;s never been easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>The familiar green apple fragrance and dandruff fighting power is evident but there is MORE body and fullness in the hair and hair style.</li>
            <li>There is a fragrance, but it is a light, general neutral &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that rinses away with the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After he got out of the shower, he did comment that his hair (curly with some grey) did feel silkier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>If he doesn&#x27;t use a shampoo to help with it, he has that kind of hair in the commercials where dandruff can show up on a black shirt.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large so he is covered for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>so the shampoo can really get in there and do its job, finish showering, then rinse off and apply conditioner.</li>
            <li>although not as much as I&#x27;ve had with Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel line.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair look and feel so much healthier, bouncy, shiny, and somehow a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really helps control dandruff well, with or without the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it adds a whole lot of body, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair</li>
            <li>Much fewer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00CNLEN8Y Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-In-1</li>
            <li>This conditioner is nice and thick, rinses off really well, and makes your hair feel a lot healthier and possibly even more volumed.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle, not too strong, and good for a male.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, rises clean, and my hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>When I first tried these, I was astonished that they made women&#x27;s hair so soft, so bouncy, so shiny!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d been a regular user of Head and Shoulders before trying this one, and says that aside from the added fragrance, he couldn&#x27;t see/feel any difference between this one and the original fragrance-free one.</li>
            <li>The same remains true today.</li>
            <li>is a whole new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I suppose most people use less conditioner than shampoo?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older mom with mid-back length hair that is a tad unruly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>like using the conditioner in particular since I&#x27;m going to typically leave it in my hair a bit longer, so it&#x27;s giving me a bit more effectiveness than using the shampoo</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I use their shampoo and conditioner mainly because of the smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and that&#x27;s important because my hair is so long and rather fine.</li>
            <li>But this has a soft, gentle scent.</li>
            <li>He thinks that it has added some thickness to the few hairs he has and if that makes him feel better, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li>and Shoulders has really come a long way from when it first hit the market.</li>
            <li>And what made me happy was that there were only a few hairs on the wide tooth comb I used.</li>
            <li>This is better performance than I have ever gotten out of any of the other big name conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that Head and Shoulders made a conditioner until recently.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much conditioner on my scalp, but mainly use it on the actual hair shafts.</li>
            <li>Washing just creates snarls and tangles, moreso now that I have a few renegrade grays going their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, because I have long hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very thick, so I was worried that the conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it flat,but I&#x27;m pleased that for the most part, it did not do this.  </li>
            <li>Although the conditioner claims to strengthen the hair to decrease breakage, I had the opposite experience, with more hair snapping in my after-shower comb-out than with previous conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Now I use Clear Scalp, which works well for my scalp chemistry.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it was, and you have to read the description very closely to see it&#x27;s only a conditioner.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>B00AFCP2RY Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice For Men 2-In-1</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful product that works both on the conditioning and dandruff fronts, at least for my long, really thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the easiest in the world to open with wet hands, but it&#x27;s not bad, and when it shuts, it snaps, so you know</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something different, or want to try something new</li>
            <li>My husband has long used Head and Shoulders but we did notice that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily care for the hair as much as my Pantene.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white creamy conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I actually used it 3 days a week though, every other day, because I really like what it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This works great for him, and he says it helps keeps his head from feeling itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and pleasant smelling as Pantene, but the trade off is fine since it helps some with the dandruff and still smells decent.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize well or replenish the hair, so that it looks and feels so much healthier and better</li>
            <li> it just leaves it really clean and super well conditioned.    </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t get the full benefits</li>
            <li> I haven’t noticed it making my hair stronger, as the product description claims, but then my hair is pretty strong to begin with.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner has a great scent with a rich, thick, silky consistency.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find that not only did it not make my hair more oily, it actually seemed to keep the oil from building up quite as quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is so much better than the old scent that Head and Shoulders had.</li>
            <li> husband doesn&#x27;t love the scent for a man, but it isn&#x27;t strong once the hair is dry, so it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll keep using here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sometimes get dandruff in the winter when it&#x27;s dry, so I kind of use this like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells nice and it leave his hair light and fluffy, without being frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice light, clean scent and is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> it just leaves hair fresh if you stick your nose in it or get very close.  </li>
            <li> is a big bottle with a flip top lid.  </li>
            <li> ; was the first comment I got tossed out to me from the shower.</li>
            <li> I was worried using the first time that it would only make my hair more oily -</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, a lot of it, and just enough natural curl that it&#x27;s never been easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> The familiar green apple fragrance and dandruff fighting power is evident but there is MORE body and fullness in the hair and hair style.</li>
            <li> There is a fragrance, but it is a light, general neutral &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that rinses away with the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After he got out of the shower, he did comment that his hair (curly with some grey) did feel silkier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> If he doesn&#x27;t use a shampoo to help with it, he has that kind of hair in the commercials where dandruff can show up on a black shirt.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large so he is covered for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> so the shampoo can really get in there and do its job, finish showering, then rinse off and apply conditioner.</li>
            <li> although not as much as I&#x27;ve had with Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel line.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair look and feel so much healthier, bouncy, shiny, and somehow a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really helps control dandruff well, with or without the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it adds a whole lot of body, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair</li>
            <li> Much fewer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00CNLEN8Y Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-In-1</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and thick, rinses off really well, and makes your hair feel a lot healthier and possibly even more volumed.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, not too strong, and good for a male.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, rises clean, and my hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> When I first tried these, I was astonished that they made women&#x27;s hair so soft, so bouncy, so shiny!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d been a regular user of Head and Shoulders before trying this one, and says that aside from the added fragrance, he couldn&#x27;t see/feel any difference between this one and the original fragrance-free one.</li>
            <li> The same remains true today.</li>
            <li> is a whole new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I suppose most people use less conditioner than shampoo?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older mom with mid-back length hair that is a tad unruly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> like using the conditioner in particular since I&#x27;m going to typically leave it in my hair a bit longer, so it&#x27;s giving me a bit more effectiveness than using the shampoo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I use their shampoo and conditioner mainly because of the smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and that&#x27;s important because my hair is so long and rather fine.</li>
            <li> But this has a soft, gentle scent.</li>
            <li> He thinks that it has added some thickness to the few hairs he has and if that makes him feel better, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> and Shoulders has really come a long way from when it first hit the market.</li>
            <li> And what made me happy was that there were only a few hairs on the wide tooth comb I used.</li>
            <li> This is better performance than I have ever gotten out of any of the other big name conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that Head and Shoulders made a conditioner until recently.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much conditioner on my scalp, but mainly use it on the actual hair shafts.</li>
            <li> Washing just creates snarls and tangles, moreso now that I have a few renegrade grays going their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, because I have long hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick, so I was worried that the conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it flat,but I&#x27;m pleased that for the most part, it did not do this.  </li>
            <li> Although the conditioner claims to strengthen the hair to decrease breakage, I had the opposite experience, with more hair snapping in my after-shower comb-out than with previous conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Now I use Clear Scalp, which works well for my scalp chemistry.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it was, and you have to read the description very closely to see it&#x27;s only a conditioner.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> B00AFCP2RY Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice For Men 2-In-1</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful product that works both on the conditioning and dandruff fronts, at least for my long, really thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the easiest in the world to open with wet hands, but it&#x27;s not bad, and when it shuts, it snaps, so you know</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something different, or want to try something new</li>
            <li> My husband has long used Head and Shoulders but we did notice that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily care for the hair as much as my Pantene.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white creamy conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I actually used it 3 days a week though, every other day, because I really like what it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it isn&#x27;t a deep conditioner, if your hair is dry you&#x27;ll still want a weekly hair masque or conditioning pack.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I do suffer from seborrheic dermatitis which is usually treated with dandruff shampoo, so I use it routinely as I will often get flaking particularly at my scalp line.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark brown hair ... and even a single flake stands out all too clearly.</li>
            <li> (700 ml)]] or other Head and Shoulders shampoo only products.</li>
            <li> My husband has uses Head and Shoulders shampoo for his dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it every day without causing visible damage.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last few weeks, only twice a week though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally consistent with my past experiences with Head &amp; Shoulders, though I usually use their combination products instead of separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and fluffy and not weighted down with grease.  </li>
            <li> And, while I do not use Head and Shoulders \\&quot;regularly,\\&quot; I do use it in winter months (when the air becomes dry from artificial heat) and year-round after long workout sessions (for some reason, it gives me the feeling of really clean hair).    </li>
            <li> hair can get a bit dry at times or seem brittle, due to all of the styling products I use.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised with how well this conditioner works, at least for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When Head and Shoulders released a line of conditioners a few years back, I decided to give the shampoos/conditioners a try.</li>
            <li> My son, who has a bigger problem with it on occasion, uses both for a few days then his issues typically resolve for a week or</li>
            <li> I have waist length wavy hair,and due to psoriasis my scalp is prone to flaking.  </li>
            <li> I even use this set when I feel like there is a \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; on my hair from other products.</li>
            <li> and then some other brand of conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure it will last.</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is thick and works really well, even on my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is hard enough to get my husband to use shampoo on his head (vs bar soap)</li>
            <li> His hair is coarse and thick, and it remains that way with this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down you hair</li>
            <li> someone with a penchant for black attire</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any less scalp itchiness when I used just the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s less dandruff flakes</li>
            <li> His hair is softer and less flyaway.</li>
            <li> I need a little oomph, not something that will weigh it down and make it look lifeless and</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the addition of fragrance (which can cause allergies and additional skin irritation), but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about scent, since I don&#x27;t like the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It rinses with no buildup or residue left behind.</li>
            <li> , I noticed a few flakes.</li>
            <li> Another conditioner I tried before this one tended to leave my hair greasy and I sometimes felt I had trouble getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> I worried about my oily scalp being coated with a heavy dandruff treatment but that didn’t happen.  </li>
            <li> The bottle says to use twice a week, so I am not sure if you used it everyday, if it would then buildup or not.</li>
            <li> , I shampooed as usual and then used this Head and Shoulders conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This formulation is stronger than the past.</li>
            <li> so I knew a dandruff conditioner would be a hard sell.</li>
            <li> Never liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells while it&#x27;s being used ... and it leaves a subtle scent behind.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets dry during the cold weather and it has been cold where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> One thing I look for in a conditioner is a detangling effect, because my long hair can get snarled up dreadfully.  </li>
            <li> My folically challenged husband also suffers from dandruff.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s really bad</li>
            <li> I now have a terrible problem with breakage.  </li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for my dandruff, so I have to use T-Gel which leaves a horrible stench.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have all the full and strong products and get compliments on my baby fine hair because it now looks fuller and healthier. My scalp is healthy and clean and am seeing regrowth</li>
            <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Its great</li>
            <li> Great item, works well. I&#x27;ll sometimes get dandruff in the winter when it&#x27;s dry, so I kind of use this like a conditioner. I&#x27;ll wash my hair, clip it up so the shampoo can really get in there and do its job, finish showering, then rinse off and apply conditioner. The smell is nice too - fresh smelling. Since I&#x27;m a girl, Head and Shoulders makes  great girly fragrance too - the Apple one - if you&#x27;re looking for a dandruff shampoo that actually smells lady-like.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a shampoo. I bought it thinking it was, and you have to read the description very closely to see it&#x27;s only a conditioner. I felt ripped off because of this.</li>
            <li> I have waist length wavy hair,and due to psoriasis my scalp is prone to flaking.  I have known many people who use Head &amp; Shoulders products and love them, this conditioner was not a hit with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, so I was worried that the conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it flat,but I&#x27;m pleased that for the most part, it did not do this.  (Note: I didn&#x27;t use it daily, only twice a week as recommended on the bottle.)  There is a fragrance, but it is a light, general neutral &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that rinses away with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One thing I look for in a conditioner is a detangling effect, because my long hair can get snarled up dreadfully.  This conditioner isn&#x27;t very good for untangling knots, which increases the chance of breakage as I attempt to remove them.  Although the conditioner claims to strengthen the hair to decrease breakage, I had the opposite experience, with more hair snapping in my after-shower comb-out than with previous conditioners.  This was the biggest factor for why some stars got knocked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice some reduction in scalp itchiness and flaking, although not as much as I&#x27;ve had with Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I have always heard that Head and Shoulders is great for anyone, because it makes your hair so nice. So, I decided to give this a try. I had never used it before and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light, clean scent and is pretty thick. I do not like and cannot use thin,runny conditioners, so I really like the consistency of Head and Shoulders. It rinses with no buildup or residue left behind. The bottle says to use twice a week, so I am not sure if you used it everyday, if it would then buildup or not. I actually used it 3 days a week though, every other day, because I really like what it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair look and feel so much healthier, bouncy, shiny, and somehow a bit thicker. It adds body without frizz or fly-aways. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and that&#x27;s important because my hair is so long and rather fine. I need a little oomph, not something that will weigh it down and make it look lifeless and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair can get a bit dry at times or seem brittle, due to all of the styling products I use. This conditioner counteracts all of that. It seems to moisturize well or replenish the hair, so that it looks and feels so much healthier and better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something different, or want to try something new, this is a great one to try. My hair always seemed so blah to me .. like it just hung there, despite my curls and waves. This conditioner perks it up and gives it life.</li>
            <li> The new incarnations of Head and Shoulders are sure surprising this reviewer!&lt;br /&gt;Up until recently, the last Head and Shoulders product I bought was in the Stone Age. Never liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;As someone with a penchant for black attire, I noticed a few flakes. Thankfully, they are in check with the new version of nicely scented H &amp; S shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This complementary conditioner also has a nice scent, and leaves hair looking like it had more volume. Since it isn&#x27;t a deep conditioner, if your hair is dry you&#x27;ll still want a weekly hair masque or conditioning pack.&lt;br /&gt;This is a whole new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner has a great scent with a rich, thick, silky consistency. It does a terrific job of moisturizing my hair leaving it look great and easier to manage. My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or uncomfortable. And it also helps to keeps any snow forming on my head and falling onto my shoulders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders has really come a long way from when it first hit the market. It&#x27;s become a premium brand that rivals hair products not for combating dandruff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but thought I&#x27;d try this conditioner when Amazon offered it to me. It&#x27;s wonderful and I really like it. It keeps my hair soft and fluffy and not weighted down with grease.  Another conditioner I tried before this one tended to leave my hair greasy and I sometimes felt I had trouble getting rid of it. This conditioner is not watery or drippy, it&#x27;s a nice thickness and smooths on my hair very well.  It rinses off easily and my hair feels great. Much better than checking my  hair twice a day to see if I washed the conditioner out and worrying about it.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant smelling light conditioner that leaves hair silky and smooth.  I worried about my oily scalp being coated with a heavy dandruff treatment but that didn’t happen.  It washes out easily and leaves my hair feeling full.  I felt the smell was too strong but not in a distracting way.</li>
            <li> head and shoulders keeps my scalp feeling so wonderful and it helps to give body to my hair. i just feel so much better when i use head and shoulders products every week in the shower. i smell great too. this is part of my weekly routine. i am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It really helps control dandruff well, with or without the shampoo.  Works well for occasional itchiness and dandruff - I find I can use EITHER the shampoo, or the conditioner alone and it will fix me up.  My son, who has a bigger problem with it on occasion, uses both for a few days then his issues typically resolve for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice fragrance, rather unisex, just fresh and clean, mostly fruity.  It&#x27;s moderately strong out of the bottle, but it dries fainter- it just leaves hair fresh if you stick your nose in it or get very close.  It&#x27;s a white creamy conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t really think it adds a whole lot of body, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;This is a big bottle with a flip top lid.  It&#x27;s not the easiest in the world to open with wet hands, but it&#x27;s not bad, and when it shuts, it snaps, so you know it&#x27;s shut.  (I always have to worry about my cats knocking mine over and it spilling if it isn&#x27;t secure.  This is a good, secure lid.)</li>
            <li> My husband has uses Head and Shoulders shampoo for his dry scalp. A number of years ago, he&#x27;d tried the shampoo and conditioner in one, and hadn&#x27;t liked the smell (nor did I). I was a little concerned about the addition of fragrance (which can cause allergies and additional skin irritation), but it seems to work well. I had an allergic reaction to something I think I ate and my body was itching all over. I used some aloe on my skin but even my scalp was itchy so I tried the shampoo and this conditioner and it helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My  husband doesn&#x27;t love the scent for a man, but it isn&#x27;t strong once the hair is dry, so it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll keep using here.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this conditioner, and it makes my hair a bit softer and more moisturized. I use this conditioner with a non-Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and I feel like it still provides anti-dandruff protection. I haven’t noticed it making my hair stronger, as the product description claims, but then my hair is pretty strong to begin with. I blow dry it every day without causing visible damage. The one thing that I didn’t like was that it made my bathtub slippery, but I have that problem with all conditioners. This conditioner had a unisex scent that did not linger in my hair.</li>
            <li> When Head and Shoulders released a line of conditioners a few years back, I decided to give the shampoos/conditioners a try. I have long, dark brown hair ... and even a single flake stands out all too clearly. And, while I do not use Head and Shoulders \\&quot;regularly,\\&quot; I do use it in winter months (when the air becomes dry from artificial heat) and year-round after long workout sessions (for some reason, it gives me the feeling of really clean hair).    When I first tried these, I was astonished that they made women&#x27;s hair so soft, so bouncy, so shiny! The same remains true today. While these products seem somewhat synonymous with \\&quot;men,\\&quot; they are just phenomenal for women&#x27;s hair as well (and, I know that P&amp;G has been trying to change the perception of Head and Shoulders as a men&#x27;s product).    Like all the Head &amp; Shoulders conditioners, this one is luxurious in thickness, smells great, rinses clean (with ease) and leaves GORGEOUS hair. I even use this set when I feel like there is a \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; on my hair from other products. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does not \\&quot;strip\\&quot; hair ... it just leaves it really clean and super well conditioned.    Head and Shoulders is (by far) the best line for dandruff treatment that there is. (It is all my father uses ... it is all that my boyfriend uses ... and even I use it on occasion). Invest your trust here. You cannot go \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older mom with mid-back length hair that is a tad unruly. I have fine hair, a lot of it, and just enough natural curl that it&#x27;s never been easy to comb out. Washing just creates snarls and tangles, moreso now that I have a few renegrade grays going their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, because I have long hair and I&#x27;m older I now have a terrible problem with breakage.  Hair breaks from being pulled back and/or out of the way, but the biggest culprit seems to be the damage done when I comb my hair out after washing it.  And this is using a conditioner and also a detangling spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I shampooed as usual and then used this Head and Shoulders conditioner.  All I can say is wow. I could comb 3/4 of my hair without having to use any detangling spray.  This is better performance than I have ever gotten out of any of the other big name conditioners.  And what made me happy was that there were only a few hairs on the wide tooth comb I used. Much fewer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any scent either in the shower or afterwards.  I also didn&#x27;t notice any less scalp itchiness when I used just the Conditioner.  What I noticed and liked was the excellent detangling properties that were left over.</li>
            <li> Great companion to [[ASIN:B001EIRRXU Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo Citrus Breeze 23.7 oz. (700 ml)]] or other Head and Shoulders shampoo only products. These days they offer many 2 in 1 productucts like [[ASIN:B00AFCP2RY Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice For Men 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz]] or[[ASIN:B00CNLEN8Y Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner 14.2 Fl Oz (packaging may vary)]] so you may want to go that route instead.  I ordered a dandruff shampoo from Vine from another company so I&#x27;m alternating using the separate products with the 2 in 1 also tried. Can&#x27;t be sure  but I  think the 2 in 1 is leaving my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a good job with controlling dandruff used with the brand&#x27;s shampoo.  The smell is not bad, many dandruff controlling products do not smell great.  It did not do a great job as a conditioner of my hair type.  I don&#x27;t think this is great for all hair types as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My folically challenged husband also suffers from dandruff. He likes to rotate out his shampoos and has commented on how nicely this version of Head and Shoulders has worked for him. He thinks that it has added some thickness to the few hairs he has and if that makes him feel better, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several years since I used a Head and Shoulder product. Now I use Clear Scalp, which works well for my scalp chemistry. As a conditioner, this Head and Shoulders works well. This formulation is stronger than the past. It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside-down bottle design also lets the product settle to the bottom, so its easier to dispense.</li>
            <li> My husband has long used Head and Shoulders but we did notice that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily care for the hair as much as my Pantene. As such, I was happy to see this H&amp;S that works to protect against split ends yet still takes care of itchy scalp (which causes the dandruff).  This worked beautifully - his hair was much sleeker and he was happy since he wasn&#x27;t scratching.  The scent is subtle, not too strong, and good for a male.  The bottle is large so he is covered for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, rises clean, and my hair feels very soft. It&#x27;s totally consistent with my past experiences with Head &amp; Shoulders, though I usually use their combination products instead of separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and is conditioning, it works OK with me but I only use conditioner on my ends and not my scalp so I couldn&#x27;t get the full benefits but my son likes it and feels it is working for him.</li>
            <li> The Texas heat keeps my scalp moist so there&#x27;s less dandruff flakes but the itching is a problem. The Full &amp; Strong conditioner is a good partner with its shampoo. The familiar green apple fragrance and dandruff fighting power is evident but there is MORE body and fullness in the hair and hair style. This is another winner in the Head and Shoulders family!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that Head and Shoulders made a conditioner until recently.  I tried this, and found that it left my hair looking great with more volume.  The scent is so much better than the old scent that Head and Shoulders had.</li>
            <li> My son is the one in our family with a flake problem. If he doesn&#x27;t use a shampoo to help with it, he has that kind of hair in the commercials where dandruff can show up on a black shirt. This works great for him, and he says it helps keeps his head from feeling itchy and dry. The shampoo smells nice and it leave his hair light and fluffy, without being frizzy. And it definitly helps keep his dandruff under control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since Head and Shoulders made a conditioner, so I&#x27;m glad to see it return to the shelves. I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I do suffer from seborrheic dermatitis which is usually treated with dandruff shampoo, so I use it routinely as I will often get flaking particularly at my scalp line. When it&#x27;s really bad I have to use a tar-based shampoo, but the H&amp;S does the job for routine use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using the conditioner in particular since I&#x27;m going to typically leave it in my hair a bit longer, so it&#x27;s giving me a bit more effectiveness than using the shampoo and then some other brand of conditioner. The results with my hair were excellent, it gave me nice soft bouncy hair with a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this conditioner regularly.</li>
            <li> awesome price and great product!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for my dandruff, so I have to use T-Gel which leaves a horrible stench. This Head and Shoulders conditioner works well in conjunction with the T-Gel shampoo, and helps to cover the stench with a more pleasurable scent. It still doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and pleasant smelling as Pantene, but the trade off is fine since it helps some with the dandruff and still smells decent. Overall I see no reason not to recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a pleasant smell and makes my husband&#x27;s hair so soft.  Works great on the dandruff.  I like the way it smells while it&#x27;s being used ... and it leaves a subtle scent behind.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hairy shoulders! I have had dandruff there for years.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of head and shoulders. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I use their shampoo and conditioner mainly because of the smell. This conditioner is nice and thick, rinses off really well, and makes your hair feel a lot healthier and possibly even more volumed. It doesn&#x27;t weight down you hair that&#x27;s for sure. It does not detangle hair well, but it definitely helps a lot if you have an itchy scalp. Especially great during the winter, and you only need to use it about 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know that Head and Shoulders made a conditioner until I had a chance to test this! I was a little worried about scent, since I don&#x27;t like the scent of the shampoo. But this has a soft, gentle scent. It also leaves my hair conditioned and I am grateful for the extra protection that this adds.</li>
            <li> My husband used this in conjunction with the Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Shampoo. He&#x27;d been a regular user of Head and Shoulders before trying this one, and says that aside from the added fragrance, he couldn&#x27;t see/feel any difference between this one and the original fragrance-free one. His hair is coarse and thick, and it remains that way with this shampoo and conditioner set. However, he is dandruff-free. He does like the scent which he finds pleasant but not overpowering, and said that he will get this one over the original one from now on. Also, he points out that the shampoo volume is greater than the conditioner volume. I suppose most people use less conditioner than shampoo? If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;d probably want to pace yourself accordingly.</li>
            <li> It is hard enough to get my husband to use shampoo on his head (vs bar soap) so I knew a dandruff conditioner would be a hard sell. He does use head and Shoulders shampoo for his dandruff; I thought this might potentiate the dandruff fighting action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s greasy!&amp;#34; was the first comment I got tossed out to me from the shower. I explained again what conditioner was and feels like. After he got out of the shower, he did comment that his hair (curly with some grey) did feel silkier and more manageable. As he has continued to use the conditioner, I have seen a big decrease in the plaque-type dandruff on his scalp. His hair is softer and less flyaway. He liked that the scent was not floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to be all over this conditioner thing (sigh) so I am not sure it will last. I can say it does seem to work well and controlling flakes.</li>
            <li> I was worried using the first time that it would only make my hair more oily - I don&#x27;t use much conditioner on my scalp, but mainly use it on the actual hair shafts. Obviously, for this to work, you have to have it on your scalp. I was so happy to find that not only did it not make my hair more oily, it actually seemed to keep the oil from building up quite as quickly. The conditioner itself is thick and works really well, even on my thick, curly hair. I was so pleasantly surprised with how well this conditioner works, at least for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when used without a dandruff shampoo first, it still does a great job keeping dandruff at bay and keeping my scalp from feeling itchy. I really like how well it works on its own, since it lets me use shampoos meant for my color treated hair but still have something to help with my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product that works both on the conditioning and dandruff fronts, at least for my long, really thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last few weeks, only twice a week though. My scalp gets dry during the cold weather and it has been cold where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my regular shampoo and then use this after. I like the way it smells, it conditions well, but most of all, it leaves any flakes on my scalp at bay. It seems using it twice is a week is enough for a treatment for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention my hair is color treated with a perm and it has not damaged it at all. This will be a product I will buy again but probably with the shampoo since I love the way it smells.</li>
