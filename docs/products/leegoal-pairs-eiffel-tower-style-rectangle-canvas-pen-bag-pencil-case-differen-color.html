            <li>These are a great deal, inexpensive, yet well made!</li>
            <li>Not the best quality.</li>

            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great pouches</li>
            <li>They work great, practical and they&#x27;re cute too.  </li>
            <li>The price is great (and I did receive four bags for my purchase), and the bags are canvas and much more sturdy than a lot of pencil or makeup travel cases you can buy for this price.</li>
            <li>So so so cute!</li>
            <li>Nice size and design.  </li>
            <li>I liked this when I viewed it.  </li>
            <li>And the exterior canvas has a nice hand to it, too.</li>
            <li>and i can fit all my favorite writing utensils in it!!</li>
            <li>Awfully cute and well made</li>
            <li>until you get about 1/4 sharpened off them :-)</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t put more than one eraser in this thing.</li>
            <li>Love the prints.</li>
            <li>I love all things &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But, still love it.</li>
            <li>The quality was okay.</li>
            <li>Cute bags.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product to an extent.</li>
            <li>The designs on the bags are cute, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying using these bags.  </li>
            <li>These pencil bags are super cute and work for adults as well as kids.</li>
            <li>Pens fit perfectly, and I have one as a little cosmetics bag.  </li>
            <li>I was going to try this as a pencil cases, the pencils fit</li>
            <li>That is why they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li>They are on the small side but work perfectly in a purse to ensure ink doesn&#x27;t get on anything you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li>Colors are exactly as described and look the exact same, so adorable and great quality.</li>
            <li>Super fun, my daughter loves them!</li>
            <li>These are great little cases.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>These are very retro and vintage, my style, and overall i think are pretty good.</li>
            <li>A pressed powder, a couple of lipsticks and a few other essentials fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>BUT I took a star off as NEW pencils actually won&#x27;t fit -</li>
            <li>Very short so doesn&#x27;t hold most pencils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should be great, though, as makeup cases or for holding very small items like erasers, post-it notes, or overly-sharpened pencils.</li>
            <li>These are really quite pretty, and you can’t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much from it when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>But for the price, you shouldn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>As cheap as it was that caught my eye, these pencil case was only a one time use.</li>
            <li>They cost me less than $1 per bag and will make a cute presentation for gift items.  </li>
            <li>They are very cute, but the size is far smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>The only two things are the fabric is thinner than i expected, and a regular pencil is too long to fit in there, so i had to sharpen it until it fit.</li>
            <li>On the downside, the zipper does feel a little cheap and the slider is a joke—</li>
            <li>Arrived a couple weeks early.</li>
            <li>They are lined and put together very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>However, since I’m not rough with it, it’s fine, and hasn’t broken on me.</li>
            <li>The thread made by the zipper is falling apart very quickly and the zipper has already broken.</li>
            <li>This product is made very poorly with very cheap material and too light colors which dirty incredibly fast.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the little leather zipper pull will last, but should be easily replaced.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the length of the bag is just barely long enough to keep a pencil in, and if you want to use it to carry something like a comb or other small tools, the bag may not be long enough to fit your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these little cases.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I use one of them to store loose change in my carry all too.</li>
            <li> The lining is a black and white striped fabric—nice.</li>
            <li> Too much wasted packaging.</li>
            <li> I use them in my work bag and everyday purse to consolidate pens and makeup.  </li>
            <li> just two thin pieces of fake leatherette riveted together, very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality.  </li>

            <li> I was going to try this as a pencil cases, the pencils fit but I can&#x27;t put more than one eraser in this thing. I wish I can return it but it all the way shipped from China. I should have checked before ordering this.</li>
            <li> So so so cute! Colors are exactly as described and look the exact same, so adorable and great quality. Going to use it for pens/makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> I use these for the art pencils I take back and forth from work.  They work great, practical and they&#x27;re cute too.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues.  I use one of them to store loose change in my carry all too.</li>
            <li> These pencil bags are super cute and work for adults as well as kids. They are on the small side but work perfectly in a purse to ensure ink doesn&#x27;t get on anything you don&#x27;t want it to. Love the prints.</li>

            <li> Nice size and design.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I viewed it.  I recently had a pen decide to display artwork in the bottom of my purse.  I was upset but now I have found a solution and this works!  I keep four pens, a stylus and a permanent marker!  A perfect size!</li>
            <li> These are really quite pretty, and you can’t beat the price. The lining is a black and white striped fabric—nice. And the exterior canvas has a nice hand to it, too. On the downside, the zipper does feel a little cheap and the slider is a joke—just two thin pieces of fake leatherette riveted together, very flimsy.

            <li> Awesome quality and surprisingly hold a lot of stuff!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality. The zipper on two of them broke.</li>
            <li> These are very retro and vintage, my style, and overall i think are pretty good.

            <li> Super fun, my daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> They are cuter in the picture.</li>
            <li> The quality was okay.</li>
            <li> Cute bags.  The striped lining moves them up a notch, otherwise they would be pretty ordinary.  They cost me less than $1 per bag and will make a cute presentation for gift items.  Definitely worth the money.  They arrived 10 days ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product to an extent. The price is great (and I did receive four bags for my purchase), and the bags are canvas and much more sturdy than a lot of pencil or makeup travel cases you can buy for this price.

The designs on the bags are cute, too. Since I only needed one or two, I intend to give the extras away as gift bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using these bags.  They seem to be well made and have held up being tossed between carry bags.</li>
            <li> Very short so doesn&#x27;t hold most pencils. Kinda a bummer, glad they weren&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> They are very cute, but the size is far smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great price. Took a very long time to arrive. Too much wasted packaging.</li>
            <li> Great pouches especially if you have a big purse.  I use them in my work bag and everyday purse to consolidate pens and makeup.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these little cases. They are lined and put together very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Actually quite durable for the price! Arrived on time and fits all of my pens perfectly.</li>
            <li> perfect size and i can fit all my favorite writing utensils in it!!</li>
            <li> They are so cute.they&#x27;re a bit small but not too small, i love it. I use each for different things like make up, utensils, snacks ,etc..</li>
