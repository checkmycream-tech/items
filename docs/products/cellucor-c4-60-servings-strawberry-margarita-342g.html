            <li> Some days just regular poop, other days diarrhea and other day straight up water poop.</li>

            <li> I think Sam&#x27;s Club has the same thing buy one get one for less money..</li>
            <li> Mid day after a few meals in.</li>
            <li> Just the regular type of pumps that I usually do from my workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went up to a scoop and a half, still nothing.</li>
            <li> For a beginner I would recommend to start with half a cup and increase the dosis little by little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price... For me I think its too expensive compared to other pre workouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another negative about C4 Extreme was that it made me poop like CRAZY!!!</li>
            <li> but amazon sent wrong flavor this time</li>

            <li> Great price for this size serving</li>
            <li> Excellent pre-workout.  I use it every time I work out.</li>
            <li> Taste 7 out of 10. Tastes good but nothing too amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix ability 9 out 10. Super easy to mix. Shook it 4 tastes and it was mixed. No foam or residues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Energy 0. I tried it in every single way.. Fasting, protein an hour before. Mid day after a few meals in. Never got any energy from it. Went up to a scoop and a half, still nothing. 2 scoops and absolutely nothing. I have high tolerance to caffeine and the only time I felt something from it was when I had a caffeine pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pump 0. Never got anything either from it. Just the regular type of pumps that I usually do from my workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price... For me I think its too expensive compared to other pre workouts. $30 for 30 servings. I have a high stim tolerance and even at 2 scoops I wasn&#x27;t feeling anything. I&#x27;ll def not spend my money on something that would take 3 or more scoops and would last me 10 days. If others are stim sensitive than good for you, you get 30 workouts out of this bottle for a $1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another negative about C4 Extreme was that it made me poop like CRAZY!!! About 10 minutes after drinking I would be in the bathroom pooping. Some days just regular poop, other days diarrhea and other day straight up water poop.</li>
            <li> Love C4 and this is a good flavor too. I heard green apple was good too.</li>
