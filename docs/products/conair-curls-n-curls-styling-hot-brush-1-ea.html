            <li>If you are looking for a Coco Exterior Door Mat this is one that&#x27;s good quality and should hold-up for a number of years.  </li>

            <li>And it packs nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love it Love it !</li>
            <li>very fine hair and the irons without nubbies won&#x27;t hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have normally gotten a very good product from conair</li>
            <li>It holds hair nicely for a good roll-up and heats to the right temp.</li>
            <li>Great hot brush...</li>
            <li>Its very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace one that had just experienced a long lifetime of curling and this product is great too.</li>
            <li>I love this curling brush.  </li>
            <li>If it came with replacement teeth it would be much better.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>BUT the teeth are falling out of mine - many on the bathroom floor with each use.</li>
            <li>I thought that it being a Conair it would be better made</li>
            <li>I have shopped many places and cannot find one in the stores.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this curling brush in supermarkets.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it there</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing, but I am looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li>My error for not paying more attention.</li>
            <li>I bought two more just in case</li>
            <li>What I like the most is the size..so convenient.  </li>
            <li>The issue: there is no heat setting for the user; there&#x27;s only ONE heat level and its factory-determined, lol!</li>
            <li>Still: I love what it was able to show me re: possibilities.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>Love it Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>this product is ok.</li>
            <li>Conair need to shorten the handle and lengthen the brush part and they would have a much better product.  </li>
            <li>My current iron is 1\\&quot; in diameter and is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the fastest I&#x27;ve ever been able to style my inverted bob.</li>
            <li>Great for my particular hair style.</li>
            <li>At first it was working good then it just wont heat up like it use to</li>
            <li>a long time ago... it was awesome for years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, safe, harmless, and pretty effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very cheap looking, but it is cheap</li>
            <li>I have very fine short hair and the shorter length of this brush is perfect for just the right curl.</li>
            <li>Good product and very durable.</li>
            <li>It also warms up very quickly.</li>
            <li>NOthing else works on my aging fine hair.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Quality seems ok but it also doesnt get very hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>This little brush is perfect for my bangs and NO forehead burns like one gets with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love this Conair Hot Brush!</li>
            <li>When I got home, I searched for a new curling brush and found this one which is just like my old favorite one.!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited and my hair is so easy to fix now.  </li>
            <li>I would think that CONAIR would realize that&#x27;s a HUGE safety issue.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap product that I think is being discontinued..</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, not durable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not curl your hair and made from cheap material.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I could have gotten a better deal ($$ wise) at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>was thrilled to come back to the USA and find this because I LOVE this hot brush!!!</li>
            <li>However, it is short and doesn&#x27;t get very warm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure if I got any hotter than it already does the material it is made of would</li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li>I will say that you need to thoroughly brush out the tangles in your hair before you start styling with this hot brush, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, and handsome also.  </li>
            <li>That part is true.  </li>
            <li>worth the $ but cheaply made</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a blow dryer along with the hot air like my old one which I loved</li>
            <li>Also fits in my tote bag for work for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>Not an adequate hair curler.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It is quick, compact and lets me finish quickly.</li>
            <li>I am SUPER dissapointed because I am from South Africa and its not like I can take</li>
            <li>I purchased it to keep at work for quick touchups.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of hot rollers having used them for decades.  </li>
            <li>The size is ideal for travel...fits perfectly in a small carry-on bag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this type for many years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this particular curling iron is very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts as long as the last one, I&#x27;ll be a happy flyer!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my hot hair brush!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and needs smoothing, and this Hot Brush works well!  </li>
            <li>This hot brush is now all I use!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t light that indicates that it&#x27;s ready to use...</li>
            <li>It has a short barrel and is ideal for short hair.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s also a victim of its own success!</li>
            <li>this is the real ticket to really nice naturally appearing curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just right for me.</li>
            <li>Heats up right away, (wheres the on/off switch???)</li>
            <li>As I grew to rely upon the brush in my hair styling, I began to see its limitations, i.e., leaving my hair a bit puffy and frizzy, which ultimately was not a problem (since the style most chosen was one that involved, essentially, bangs protruding from a hat or scarf), I began to want the brush to smooth more than it could.</li>
            <li>It has nice long teeth</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and slips thru regular rod styles</li>
            <li>I used it once and right out of the package I did my first curl...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as others I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth returning, it would cost more to send back.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I like my curling iron to get so hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this is why I am the only one to give this product a review everybody else knew better.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll pay more and</li>
            <li>This HOT BRUSH does not curl is basically a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I like the Conair BC40JBC hot brush, 0.75 inch.  </li>
            <li>thought it was a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>This came up when I had typed in Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li>it does not get even close to hot.  </li>
            <li>Wants this style but blow warm air to help dry hair also.</li>
            <li>The curler is the right size, very portable.  </li>
            <li>OK to smooth ends a little,</li>
            <li>I carried an exact clone of this with me for over 20 years as a flight attendant.  </li>
            <li>so I can grab the hair easily as my hair is on the short side.</li>
            <li>I have fine, short hair</li>
            <li>It does not tangle in my short hair and gives me very pretty waves as well as curls!  </li>
            <li>You plug it in; the light goes on; it heats up (and it&#x27;s not instant or even fast); you use it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money, but I&#x27;ve purchased $10 curling irons before that have lasted me years.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap dish out the extra $5 and get something that is going to get the job done</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Get a real hair curler and use with oil treatments</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this one in stores, so thanks Amazon for having what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I would be very upset.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars: It&#x27;s really 4.5 stars-worthy.  </li>
            <li>An absolute piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>This is really just a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; brush...</li>
            <li>It did not heat up very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl the hair - only heats to a luke warm.  </li>
            <li>I have had my previous hot brush for many years, and it has served me well.  </li>
            <li>This new Hot Brush, I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I was aware of this when I made the purchase but was desparate to find a new one.</li>
            <li>With other curling brushes, you have to turn a switch to make sure it starts heating up.  </li>
            <li>I looked and looked until I found this one as the original one I had finally wore out,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t heat up past luke warm.  </li>
            <li>At this time, I was in need of a new one, so I purchased this particular style, and have not been happier!</li>
            <li>I like the Hot Brush, I have short hair which I blow dry and use the Brush to finish the top.  </li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because it looked like a decent size to use when traveling.</li>
            <li>I wanted a decent curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I like this curling brush for 3 main reasons.  </li>
            <li>It finally gave up the ghost last year after so many years of abuse.  </li>
            <li>This is a small, compact curling brush, gets hot quickly - has no settings like low or high, it just comes on when you plug it in, thats ok with me, just have to remember to unplug it when not in use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up high at all.</li>
            <li>but it takes a bit longer to curl as it doesn&#x27;t get to a really high temperature.</li>
            <li>I love this little curling brush.</li>
            <li>This little brush is even better than a curling iron or straightener.  </li>
            <li>I can hold it with my bare hands when it&#x27;s &#x27;hot.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love the fact that because my hair is shorter, this comb/curling iron can not only curl, but also dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>The only kind of iron I like are the ones with the little plastic \\&quot;nubbies\\&quot; on the ends of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>and then it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>When I used my Conair Hot Brush for the 2nd time(still brand new)</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li>The return was simple just like they stated and I reorder the hot air brush I wanted.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t really have any moving parts, so unless it shorts out, it&#x27;ll last nearly forever.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, so far, it does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing my old one.  </li>
            <li>kinda looks old.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for soft curls or waves.</li>
            <li>And, there isn&#x27;t an off/on switch, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>makes frizzies into soft curls.</li>
            <li>Soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have at least found this one.</li>
            <li>Such concerns are a non-issue with this brush, thanks to the \\&quot;protective\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am a professional hairdresser and recommend this for my customers and use it at home and at work.</li>
            <li>I have been hunting high and low for a curling iron to replace my aging one.  </li>
            <li>A little big for my short hair, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Could have used 1/2 inch but very few of this type curling iron available.</li>
            <li>If you want dry and styled haired fast, go with this one.</li>
            <li>Also very cheap plastic material, paper thin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do, too much work.</li>
            <li>Product does not heat up enough to style hair had it plugged in for 15 minutes was still cool to the touch don t waste your money</li>
            <li>I love this small, lightweight brush and it helped me start down a proper path for my short, multi-textured, soft, thin(ning), natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, curls my hair fast, and is small enough to take with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li>so your hair does not dry out.</li>
            <li>Conair should be ashamed for making such a ridiculous and cheap product.</li>
            <li>Plug fits loosely and if I move too far away, it comes out of outlet.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my baby fine, thin hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is better than nothing, but I am looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> My error for not paying more attention.</li>
            <li> I bought two more just in case</li>
            <li> What I like the most is the size..so convenient.  </li>
            <li> The issue: there is no heat setting for the user; there&#x27;s only ONE heat level and its factory-determined, lol!</li>
            <li> Still: I love what it was able to show me re: possibilities.</li>
            <li> Love it  </li>
            <li> Love it Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> this product is ok.</li>
            <li> Conair need to shorten the handle and lengthen the brush part and they would have a much better product.  </li>
            <li> My current iron is 1\\&quot; in diameter and is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fastest I&#x27;ve ever been able to style my inverted bob.</li>
            <li> Great for my particular hair style.</li>
            <li> At first it was working good then it just wont heat up like it use to</li>
            <li> a long time ago... it was awesome for years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, safe, harmless, and pretty effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very cheap looking, but it is cheap</li>
            <li> I have very fine short hair and the shorter length of this brush is perfect for just the right curl.</li>
            <li> Good product and very durable.</li>
            <li> It also warms up very quickly.</li>
            <li> NOthing else works on my aging fine hair.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Quality seems ok but it also doesnt get very hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> This little brush is perfect for my bangs and NO forehead burns like one gets with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair Hot Brush!</li>
            <li> When I got home, I searched for a new curling brush and found this one which is just like my old favorite one.!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited and my hair is so easy to fix now.  </li>
            <li> I would think that CONAIR would realize that&#x27;s a HUGE safety issue.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap product that I think is being discontinued..</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, not durable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not curl your hair and made from cheap material.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I could have gotten a better deal ($$ wise) at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> was thrilled to come back to the USA and find this because I LOVE this hot brush!!!</li>
            <li> However, it is short and doesn&#x27;t get very warm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure if I got any hotter than it already does the material it is made of would</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I will say that you need to thoroughly brush out the tangles in your hair before you start styling with this hot brush, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, and handsome also.  </li>
            <li> That part is true.  </li>
            <li> worth the $ but cheaply made</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a blow dryer along with the hot air like my old one which I loved</li>
            <li> Also fits in my tote bag for work for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> Not an adequate hair curler.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is quick, compact and lets me finish quickly.</li>
            <li> I am SUPER dissapointed because I am from South Africa and its not like I can take</li>
            <li> I purchased it to keep at work for quick touchups.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of hot rollers having used them for decades.  </li>
            <li> The size is ideal for travel...fits perfectly in a small carry-on bag.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type for many years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this particular curling iron is very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts as long as the last one, I&#x27;ll be a happy flyer!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my hot hair brush!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and needs smoothing, and this Hot Brush works well!  </li>
            <li> This hot brush is now all I use!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t light that indicates that it&#x27;s ready to use...</li>
            <li> It has a short barrel and is ideal for short hair.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s also a victim of its own success!</li>
            <li> this is the real ticket to really nice naturally appearing curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up right away, (wheres the on/off switch???)</li>
            <li> As I grew to rely upon the brush in my hair styling, I began to see its limitations, i.e., leaving my hair a bit puffy and frizzy, which ultimately was not a problem (since the style most chosen was one that involved, essentially, bangs protruding from a hat or scarf), I began to want the brush to smooth more than it could.</li>
            <li> It has nice long teeth</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and slips thru regular rod styles</li>
            <li> I used it once and right out of the package I did my first curl...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as others I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth returning, it would cost more to send back.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like my curling iron to get so hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this is why I am the only one to give this product a review everybody else knew better.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll pay more and</li>
            <li> This HOT BRUSH does not curl is basically a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I like the Conair BC40JBC hot brush, 0.75 inch.  </li>
            <li> thought it was a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> This came up when I had typed in Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li> it does not get even close to hot.  </li>
            <li> Wants this style but blow warm air to help dry hair also.</li>
            <li> The curler is the right size, very portable.  </li>
            <li> OK to smooth ends a little,</li>
            <li> I carried an exact clone of this with me for over 20 years as a flight attendant.  </li>
            <li> so I can grab the hair easily as my hair is on the short side.</li>
            <li> I have fine, short hair</li>
            <li> It does not tangle in my short hair and gives me very pretty waves as well as curls!  </li>
            <li> You plug it in; the light goes on; it heats up (and it&#x27;s not instant or even fast); you use it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money, but I&#x27;ve purchased $10 curling irons before that have lasted me years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be cheap dish out the extra $5 and get something that is going to get the job done</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Get a real hair curler and use with oil treatments</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this one in stores, so thanks Amazon for having what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I would be very upset.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars: It&#x27;s really 4.5 stars-worthy.  </li>
            <li> An absolute piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This is really just a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; brush...</li>
            <li> It did not heat up very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl the hair - only heats to a luke warm.  </li>
            <li> I have had my previous hot brush for many years, and it has served me well.  </li>
            <li> This new Hot Brush, I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I was aware of this when I made the purchase but was desparate to find a new one.</li>
            <li> With other curling brushes, you have to turn a switch to make sure it starts heating up.  </li>
            <li> I looked and looked until I found this one as the original one I had finally wore out,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t heat up past luke warm.  </li>
            <li> At this time, I was in need of a new one, so I purchased this particular style, and have not been happier!</li>
            <li> I like the Hot Brush, I have short hair which I blow dry and use the Brush to finish the top.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because it looked like a decent size to use when traveling.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I like this curling brush for 3 main reasons.  </li>
            <li> It finally gave up the ghost last year after so many years of abuse.  </li>
            <li> This is a small, compact curling brush, gets hot quickly - has no settings like low or high, it just comes on when you plug it in, thats ok with me, just have to remember to unplug it when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up high at all.</li>
            <li> but it takes a bit longer to curl as it doesn&#x27;t get to a really high temperature.</li>
            <li> I love this little curling brush.</li>
            <li> This little brush is even better than a curling iron or straightener.  </li>
            <li> I can hold it with my bare hands when it&#x27;s &#x27;hot.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love the fact that because my hair is shorter, this comb/curling iron can not only curl, but also dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only kind of iron I like are the ones with the little plastic \\&quot;nubbies\\&quot; on the ends of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and then it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> When I used my Conair Hot Brush for the 2nd time(still brand new)</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li> The return was simple just like they stated and I reorder the hot air brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Of course, it doesn&#x27;t really have any moving parts, so unless it shorts out, it&#x27;ll last nearly forever.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, so far, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing my old one.  </li>
            <li> kinda looks old.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for soft curls or waves.</li>
            <li> And, there isn&#x27;t an off/on switch, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> makes frizzies into soft curls.</li>
            <li> Soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to have at least found this one.</li>
            <li> Such concerns are a non-issue with this brush, thanks to the \\&quot;protective\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am a professional hairdresser and recommend this for my customers and use it at home and at work.</li>
            <li> I have been hunting high and low for a curling iron to replace my aging one.  </li>
            <li> A little big for my short hair, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Could have used 1/2 inch but very few of this type curling iron available.</li>
            <li> If you want dry and styled haired fast, go with this one.</li>
            <li> Also very cheap plastic material, paper thin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do, too much work.</li>
            <li> Product does not heat up enough to style hair had it plugged in for 15 minutes was still cool to the touch don t waste your money</li>
            <li> I love this small, lightweight brush and it helped me start down a proper path for my short, multi-textured, soft, thin(ning), natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, curls my hair fast, and is small enough to take with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li> so your hair does not dry out.</li>
            <li> Conair should be ashamed for making such a ridiculous and cheap product.</li>
            <li> Plug fits loosely and if I move too far away, it comes out of outlet.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my baby fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> the brush part is only 3 inches long which is not long enough to curl a section of hair.  </li>
            <li> It will tangle in long hair if you are not real careful.</li>
            <li> Hot brushes are hard to find</li>
            <li> does not get  hot never warm</li>
            <li> Well that was the last time I used it because my long hair got so tangled in the barrel that I couldn&#x27;t get it untangled .</li>
            <li> But definitely not for long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too slow to reach the hot point...</li>
            <li> This particular  electric brush does not heat up enough and is not effective in smoothing and curling my hair.</li>
            <li> this hot brush is not good as the brand name.</li>
            <li> Takes way too long to heat up.</li>
            <li> Not professional quality.  </li>
            <li> Others are too long.  </li>
            <li> Would not work well with long hair</li>
            <li> The teeth of the comb catch my short hair very well where some other brushes were hard to use my hair just slipped out.  </li>
            <li> The second disappointment is that it takes FOREVER to heat up (at least to the point where I&#x27;m satisfied).</li>
            <li> Really not what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was so miscarried by the earlier reviews on this product , but I must say it is just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It smooths out my short hair with just a few comb throughs.</li>
            <li> It is heavy weight enough that windy days should not blow it away.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles are durable and not a single one has broken off over the last year.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is not better than nothing - it&#x27;s the same as nothing.</li>
            <li> I replaced with a different model and my hair just was so hard to fix.  </li>
            <li> And was not worth it.</li>
            <li> The supply voltage is 220 Volts I had to purchase another step down transformer.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin and soft for curling irons (which destroy any measure of body or fullness); irons also are skin burn hazards.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the few dollars it cost.</li>
            <li> the bristles could be a little lobnger to grab the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of 8.00.</li>
            <li> Cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> This one is for small tight curls.  </li>
            <li> but, alas, it was only 3/4 of an inch in diameter and just too small for my semi-straight hair style.</li>
            <li> Was finding it difficult to find the brush style curling items in the local stores.</li>
            <li> too small and no temperature control.</li>
            <li> Conair has made the style like this in the past, just can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> Its small,  so no problem with storing it away when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work no matter how small you section your hair and doesn&#x27;t heat up well.</li>
            <li> I was  a little confused about that.</li>
            <li> I hope it is at least .</li>
            <li> Anyways .. the first disappointment is there is no \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch!!</li>
            <li> but this is not a good one.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up, and is so feeble that I could not even get a small section of my easy-to-curl hair to curl.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed and this product is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Also, the cord exit out of the curling iron has a swivel so that the cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted or tangled.  </li>
            <li> It will soon be without teeth altogether and useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Then, when out of the country, it melted with the wrong voltage.  </li>
            <li> When I received it was opened... :(</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this curling iron</li>
            <li> This product is horrible and should not be used even if it were given as a gift.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an on/off SWITCH, and I don&#x27;t feel like unplugging the cord every time. Also no automatic shut off. Quality seems ok but it also doesnt get very hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;Im very disappointed</li>
            <li> Plug fits loosely and if I move too far away, it comes out of outlet.  Otherwise, so far, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Doesn&#x27;t have a on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Was finding it difficult to find the brush style curling items in the local stores. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money, but I&#x27;ve purchased $10 curling irons before that have lasted me years.

The second disappointment is that it takes FOREVER to heat up (at least to the point where I&#x27;m satisfied). Other than that, it&#x27;s a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased...I&#x27;m replacing my old one.  I love this curling brush.  It holds hair nicely for a good roll-up and heats to the right temp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t light that indicates that it&#x27;s ready to use... It&#x27;s too slow to reach the hot point... When I received it was opened... :( kinda looks old.</li>
            <li> Bought this last year for my girlfriend, and it&#x27;s still kicking. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t really have any moving parts, so unless it shorts out, it&#x27;ll last nearly forever. The brush bristles are durable and not a single one has broken off over the last year. Also, the cord exit out of the curling iron has a swivel so that the cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted or tangled.  She uses it daily and leaves it on a bathroom shelf all the time. Good product and very durable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be cheap dish out the extra $5 and get something that is going to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very cheap looking, but it is cheap so how can i complain.  I don&#x27;t even know if I can call the material it is made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t heat up past luke warm.  I like my curling iron to get so hot I can&#x27;t touch it, this one is so warm I can just leave my finger on it without getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure if I got any hotter than it already does the material it is made of would melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel itself is very short.  It&#x27;s like a travel/mini iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At it&#x27;s best this is just a brush with a cord on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is why I am the only one to give this product a review everybody else knew better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it . I used it once and right out of the package I did my first curl... Well that was the last time I used it because my long hair got so tangled in the barrel that I couldn&#x27;t get it untangled . I had to cut it out .. Thankfully it was in the front so I now have bangs. This is a cheap product that I think is being discontinued.. I hope it is at least .</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because it looked like a decent size to use when traveling. That part is true.  The problem is that the teeth on the iron continually break off.  If it came with replacement teeth it would be much better.  Cheap plastic, not durable.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again. BUT the teeth are falling out of mine - many on the bathroom floor with each use. It will soon be without teeth altogether and useless. Next time I&#x27;ll pay more and hpoefully get a better product!!</li>
            <li> I had a mishap in Europe...power melted the unit&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to come back to the USA and find this because I LOVE this hot brush!!!</li>
            <li> The curler is the right size, very portable.  It also warms up very quickly.</li>
            <li> this hot brush is not good as the brand name. it&#x27;s not curl your hair and made from cheap material. I used it just only one time and put it in the closet.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my baby fine, thin hair.  Works like a charm.  I am so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Has no on and off button. Doesn&#x27;t heat up high at all. And was not worth it.</li>
            <li> At first it was working good then it just wont heat up like it use to</li>
            <li> A little big for my short hair, but that&#x27;s okay - it&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> too small and no temperature control. you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent curling iron.  This one is for small tight curls.  Not recommended for soft curls or waves.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my hot hair brush! As soon as I opened the package I was not happy. Its very cheaply made. Does not get hot enough to hold a curl. I thought that it being a Conair it would be better made but I guess theirs lows and highs to every brand.</li>
            <li> I love this little curling brush. I have shopped many places and cannot find one in the stores. This little brush is perfect for my bangs and NO forehead burns like one gets with a curling iron. It has a short barrel and is ideal for short hair. It will tangle in long hair if you are not real careful. It is just right for me. I wish I could buy it in a store...I looked at Fred&#x27;s and they do not carry it, nor does Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is this product is not for people of color. I was highly disappointed and this product is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product. It&#x27;s a waste of 8.00. This product has no off and on switch. It also has no switch for heating preference. Takes way too long to heat up. I would have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle.</li>
            <li> Not professional quality.  Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Do like it. Really not what she was looking for. Wants this style but blow warm air to help dry hair also. Conair has made the style like this in the past, just can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The size is ideal for travel...fits perfectly in a small carry-on bag.  Also fits in my tote bag for work for quick touch-ups.  Heats up quickly and is ideal for my needs.  Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I like this curling brush for 3 main reasons.  One, it does the job. Two, it starts heating up as soon as you plug it in.  With other curling brushes, you have to turn a switch to make sure it starts heating up.  Three, it&#x27;s the smallest curling brush I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s a good size for curling a segment of hair as you work around your head.  Others are too long.  And it packs nicely.  I used to be able to buy this curling brush in supermarkets.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it there any more so I ordered 4 of them from Amazon!</li>
            <li> easy to use and works great</li>
            <li> I was so miscarried by the earlier reviews on this product , but I must say it is just a waste of money.  The brush does not get got enough , does not make any difference in my hair. No help with setting your hair style.</li>
            <li> This HOT BRUSH does not curl is basically a piece of junk. Not an adequate hair curler. Get a real hair curler and use with oil treatments so your hair does not dry out.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.  I realized later I could have gotten a better deal ($$ wise) at the local drug store.  And, there isn&#x27;t an off/on switch, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Whoever gave this product a good review may be trying to get everyone else to buy it so they won&#x27;t be the only foolish ones. This product is horrible and should not be used even if it were given as a gift. Conair should be ashamed for making such a ridiculous and cheap product. Get a good curling iron PLEASE spend the extra money. This isn&#x27;t even worth returning, it would cost more to send back. It got tangled in my hair to the point where I had to cut it off. Also very cheap plastic material, paper thin. Heats up right away, (wheres the on/off switch???) The world may never know!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle in your hair. great for fine hair. makes frizzies into soft curls. Soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp. I&#x27;ve used this type for many years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind. I use them until the bristles break off from daily use. please keep making them !</li>
            <li> This appliance has no on/off switch and no temperature dial - you plug it in, it gets to the temperature it gets to, and that&#x27;s all.  When you&#x27;re done, you have to unplug it to shut it off.  It does not get hot enough to do anything.  The barrel is too short.  Get another brand.  This is not better than nothing - it&#x27;s the same as nothing.</li>
            <li> This is a small, compact curling brush, gets hot quickly - has no settings like low or high, it just comes on when you plug it in, thats ok with me, just have to remember to unplug it when not in use.  It smooths out my short hair with just a few comb throughs. Its small,  so no problem with storing it away when not in use.  The teeth of the comb catch my short hair very well where some other brushes were hard to use my hair just slipped out.  Would not work well with long hair I think.</li>
            <li> does not get  hot never warm</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work no matter how small you section your hair and doesn&#x27;t heat up well. I can hold it with my bare hands when it&#x27;s &#x27;hot.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this Conair Hot Brush! Conair is a trusted brand, and I have used it for many years! At this time, I was in need of a new one, so I purchased this particular style, and have not been happier! I have had my previous hot brush for many years, and it has served me well.  This new Hot Brush, I use it every day.  It does not tangle in my short hair and gives me very pretty waves as well as curls!  My hair is curly and needs smoothing, and this Hot Brush works well!  I will buy it again in the future when the need arises.</li>
            <li> This is a great - I call it curling iron.  Very high quality, and handsome also.  I recommend this product.  DAME HILDA</li>
            <li> I like the Conair BC40JBC hot brush, 0.75 inch.  It is perfect for my medium length hair.  Heats up fast, curls my hair fast, and is small enough to take with me when I travel.  I can&#x27;t find this one in stores, so thanks Amazon for having what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to style my hair not only at home but when I&#x27;m on the run. It fits very nicely into my tote bag for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush. I have very fine short hair and the shorter length of this brush is perfect for just the right curl. I can&#x27;t find this brush in the stores anymore, so I appreciate Amazon carrying them. I hope you continue to supply them for us that need this product. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Love it! But definitely not for long hair.</li>
            <li> Great tool, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t snag. Just wish that it came in a slightly smaller barrel size. I searched the internet, but couldn&#x27;t find one by Conair, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Hot brushes are hard to find so I&#x27;m glad to have at least found this one. However, it is short and doesn&#x27;t get very warm. It has not temperature control or on/off switch.  It is better than nothing, but I am looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> thought it was a hot air brush. My error for not paying more attention. I could not find the desired 1/2inch style</li>
            <li> Great hot brush...just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake when I order.  This came up when I had typed in Hot Air Brush and I didn&#x27;t notice until after it arrived several days later.  The return was simple just like they stated and I reorder the hot air brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this.  It does not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of hot rollers having used them for decades.  This hot brush is now all I use!  No need to wait for rollers then wait for&lt;br /&gt;the rollers to set.  This little brush is even better than a curling iron or straightener.  Love it!  I bought two more just in case they stop manufacturing them.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is great. It has nice long teeth so I can grab the hair easily as my hair is on the short side. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it. I would be very upset.</li>
            <li> I like the Hot Brush, I have short hair which I blow dry and use the Brush to finish the top.  &lt;br /&gt;It is quick, compact and lets me finish quickly.</li>
            <li> Gets tangled in my short hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item or recommend it.</li>
            <li> What I like the most is the size..so convenient.  I looked and looked until I found this one as the original one I had finally wore out,  I do wish the barrel was just a bit smaller....but this works and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I love this small, lightweight brush and it helped me start down a proper path for my short, multi-textured, soft, thin(ning), natural hair.  But, it&#x27;s also a victim of its own success! As I grew to rely upon the brush in my hair styling, I began to see its limitations, i.e., leaving my hair a bit puffy and frizzy, which ultimately was not a problem (since the style most chosen was one that involved, essentially, bangs protruding from a hat or scarf), I began to want the brush to smooth more than it could. The issue: there is no heat setting for the user; there&#x27;s only ONE heat level and its factory-determined, lol! You plug it in; the light goes on; it heats up (and it&#x27;s not instant or even fast); you use it.  Still: I love what it was able to show me re: possibilities. My hair is too thin and soft for curling irons (which destroy any measure of body or fullness); irons also are skin burn hazards.  Such concerns are a non-issue with this brush, thanks to the \\&quot;protective\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars: It&#x27;s really 4.5 stars-worthy.  It&#x27;s cute, safe, harmless, and pretty effective.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Coco Exterior Door Mat this is one that&#x27;s good quality and should hold-up for a number of years.  It is heavy weight enough that windy days should not blow it away.  Shipping and time arrival were very good!</li>
            <li> Love it  Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it ! If you want dry and styled haired fast, go with this one.</li>
            <li> I carried an exact clone of this with me for over 20 years as a flight attendant.  It finally gave up the ghost last year after so many years of abuse.  If this one lasts as long as the last one, I&#x27;ll be a happy flyer!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great at all.</li>
            <li> As with the curling iron, I&#x27;ve had a number of these and don&#x27;t care to try anything different.  I have enough &amp;#34;disappointments&amp;#34; in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Product does not heat up enough to style hair had it plugged in for 15 minutes was still cool to the touch don t waste your money</li>
            <li> I got this to use at our weekend getaway and for travel. It&#x27;s compact so it packs well. I have fine, short hair and it&#x27;s sufficient but it takes a bit longer to curl as it doesn&#x27;t get to a really high temperature. But overall it does the job for the purposes it was intended: weekend and travel.</li>
            <li> this product is ok. it heats up well. the bristles could be a little lobnger to grab the hair. worth the $ but cheaply made</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a blow dryer along with the hot air like my old one which I loved but it finally gave out.  It is my fault I guess for not properly understanding the description of the product.</li>
            <li> When I used my Conair Hot Brush for the 2nd time(still brand new) the plastic(just below the brush part) melted like a toy and the brush just hang to the one side, I cannot use it! I am SUPER dissapointed because I am from South Africa and its not like I can take&lt;br /&gt;it back and exchange it for anything else...</li>
            <li> I needed to replace one that had just experienced a long lifetime of curling and this product is great too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl the hair - only heats to a luke warm.  Not worth the few dollars it cost.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to get hot enough.  Barrel is too short.</li>
            <li> An absolute piece of garbage. Takes forever to heat up, and is so feeble that I could not even get a small section of my easy-to-curl hair to curl.</li>
            <li> Excellent for all ages and I am a professional hairdresser and recommend this for my customers and use it at home and at work.</li>
            <li> This product is compact so it is great for traveling or the gym.  I purchased it to keep at work for quick touchups.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this curling iron the brush part is only 3 inches long which is not long enough to curl a section of hair.  Conair need to shorten the handle and lengthen the brush part and they would have a much better product.  I have normally gotten a very good product from conair but this one is not one of them.  I do not recommend purchasing this curling brush.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... it&#x27;s in my trash can. I&#x27;ve never used one of these before and never will again.&lt;br /&gt;I got the thing so tangled in my hair and almost thought I was going to have to cut my hair at the scalp to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;This is for short hair only!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that because my hair is shorter, this comb/curling iron can not only curl, but also dry my hair.  Great for my particular hair style.</li>
            <li> This does not heat up enough to form and hold a curl.</li>
            <li> this is the real ticket to really nice naturally appearing curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do leave home without it.  happy curls, happy happy</li>
            <li> I have been hunting high and low for a curling iron to replace my aging one.  The only kind of iron I like are the ones with the little plastic \\&quot;nubbies\\&quot; on the ends of the teeth.  I have very fine hair and the irons without nubbies won&#x27;t hold my hair.  I find the brush irons too tangley.  I was so happy to find this one but, alas, it was only 3/4 of an inch in diameter and just too small for my semi-straight hair style. I was aware of this when I made the purchase but was desparate to find a new one. My current iron is 1\\&quot; in diameter and is perfect. Please, Conair!  Make a 1\\&quot;iron with nubbies on the comb ends!!</li>
            <li> Just a bit too big for hair length. Could have used 1/2 inch but very few of this type curling iron available. My hair is very fine and slips thru regular rod styles</li>
            <li> This is really just a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; brush...it does not get even close to hot.  OK to smooth ends a little, but that&#x27;s about it.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> It did not heat up very well.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this particular curling iron is very gentle on my hair. Thank you for still keeping the iron for sale so I can use it.  NOthing else works on my aging fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I will say that you need to thoroughly brush out the tangles in your hair before you start styling with this hot brush, but I love it. It&#x27;s the fastest I&#x27;ve ever been able to style my inverted bob.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do, too much work. I am back to using regular hair rollers now</li>
            <li> I had a curling brush like this once upon a time ...a long time ago... it was awesome for years and then it was time for a new one.  I replaced with a different model and my hair just was so hard to fix.  Then, when out of the country, it melted with the wrong voltage.  When I got home, I searched for a new curling brush and found this one which is just like my old favorite one.!!! I was so excited and my hair is so easy to fix now.  So happy.  Please keep making this model.</li>
            <li> This particular  electric brush does not heat up enough and is not effective in smoothing and curling my hair. I have used this type of brush(all different brands) for over 20 years but this is not a good one.</li>
            <li> Cheap and worthless. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as others I&#x27;ve had.  All in all, it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> You did not specify that the operating voltage was 120 volt! The supply voltage is 220 Volts I had to purchase another step down transformer.</li>
