            <li>Good for those with vision problems.</li>
            <li>optics are good for any porexic (you know who you are)  </li>
            <li>The price for value is good, too.</li>
            <li>And if I lean up that close to my vanity mirror, my lighting isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good for all my needs for a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>The reflection is good quality</li>
            <li>but like I said I have a good one but needed one for work and on the road</li>
            <li>For those of you looking for a good make-up mirror</li>
            <li>Very nice, good finish and will recommend this :)</li>
            <li>Excellent and so useful.</li>
            <li>The 20x magnification is great for checking fine details of makeup (before putting in contacts or putting on glasses).  </li>
            <li>20 times is amazing</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they made a lighted version.</li>
            <li>Helps if you have a good light source to use it with.</li>
            <li>a 15x might be better for me, but I can&#x27;t find one like this.</li>
            <li>it magnifies more than I thought it could..</li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Does magnify better than my 15x makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I sure can&#x27;t use it as a mirror.</li>
            <li>Most of the magnification mirrors say 15 or 20X</li>
            <li>I recently found a great mini 20x lighted (!!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great mirror for those of us who really struggle to see things close up.</li>
            <li>I ordered another brand on Amazon that claimed to be 20 X, but was more like 15 X.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It helps me see what my Magic</li>
            <li>It had many raving reviews</li>
            <li>and this is okay</li>
            <li>I had a 15x which was sort of okay for make-up, but this one is fantastic!</li>
            <li>muchos poros y quede muy limpio jajajaj, this mirror is all, many pores and remains very clean jajajaj</li>
            <li>this mirrow is very useful to get rid of the hairs incrusted in the skin after shaving !</li>
            <li>better smile!</li>
            <li>Make up is so easy and it attaches to surfaces well&lt;br</li>
            <li>let me tell you, this baby is STRONG.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong, in fact, that you might need some practice using it.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend it.it is a strong mini Mirrow,cool</li>
            <li>This is a mirror you need to hold to get the benefit of the strong magnification.</li>
            <li>The mirror is toooooo strong.</li>
            <li>Small mirror provides great magnification while fitting nicely in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li>With warm compresses and lid scrubs I can relieve the condition some and with this mirror I am able to get a much better visual of what if any visible effect  these hygiene efforts are having.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the light in</li>
            <li>This would be a great product IF the mirror were larger.  </li>
            <li>received fast and as ordered great price , thanks</li>
            <li>I though this would be good for removing ingrown hairs on my beard, but the farthest I could clearly see was my chin.  </li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t as good as my old one.  </li>
            <li>It is great for &amp;#34;zooming in&amp;#34; on a particular spot, not getting the whole picture.</li>
            <li>The mirror is small, which is perfect for a purse.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I found that this mirror was actually too powerful!  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, friendly service.</li>
            <li>The mirror is good to have for anybody just to check closely what&#x27;s going on with your facial skin.</li>
            <li>It is not large, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>This is the fourth mirror from Zadro(2-10X and 2-20X) all mirrors are perfect no distortions in the reflectivity of the glass.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for seeing yourself up close and personal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this mirror and at last</li>
            <li>I can see my skin clearly!!!!!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>Its sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>With it, I am able to see that I have completely cleaned my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>True, you do have to tilt it a little to get a good view as others have said.  </li>
            <li>But boy, when you get the right tilt...</li>
            <li>With 20x magnification, you have to put your face right up against it and there is a lot of distortion.</li>
            <li>I wear a very strong contact prescription, which has the effect of making things close appear smaller and lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have a older mirror that is a full hand held I purchased at walmart.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>Actually, it has almost no distortion except at the edges, which is understandable, and it fully lives up to its 20 power claim, being able to see even the tiniest eyebrow hair and eyelash in the eye.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what these aging eyes need.</li>
            <li>Very well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is almost too much magnification!  </li>
            <li>It is kind of hollow under the mirror so its needs more gentle care than a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is so powerful you are looking at a whole new world never before seen!</li>
            <li>WOW, it&#x27;s magnification was bigger than I wanted, but great to really see every tiny hair and skin cell.  </li>
            <li>BUT the 3 suction cups that hold the mirror to another surface come apart easily and are already starting to flatten up therefore losing suction power  </li>
            <li>I can remove facial hair easily with a tweezer, which I am use to do for years.</li>
            <li>Extra strong for getting things out of an eye.</li>
            <li>This little mirror is the nicest mirror of its kind that I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to take a good look at your face with the shape of this mirror.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable considering  the magnification available locally is  8-10x max.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a travel mirror with this much magnification.  </li>
            <li>but really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Its an absolute must to have one of these mirrors.</li>
            <li>mirror does the trick very well.</li>
            <li>Really helps .</li>
            <li>The suction cups work VERY well</li>
            <li>But whenever you use this mirror, you must hold it very close.  </li>
            <li>Now this is REALLY 20 X Magnification.  </li>
            <li>use this mirror, you need to hold it close to your eyes and look straight into it.  </li>
            <li>It is very blurry up close.  </li>
            <li>Great for poor eyesight when trying to put on makeup.  </li>
            <li>This really is 20x magnification.  </li>
            <li>Swissco mirror claimed to be 20x, but is really about 15x.  </li>
            <li>Have to get up to mirror real close to visualize.  </li>
            <li>Its suction cups do work very well.  </li>
            <li>Can really see close up of your face</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>The backing on the mirror isn&#x27;t perfectly concave; it&#x27;s a little wavy creating a distorted reflection that I have to manuever around to find a focused small area.  </li>
            <li>For general purposes (e.g., applying eye makeup), a magnifying mirror with 5X magnification is a much better choice, because the 5X mirror will show a larger area of your face.</li>
            <li>This is the best little mirror under the sun and the magnification over 10X is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li>and it is priced too high.</li>
            <li>I have diabetes and when my # is too high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just a bit high a magnification</li>
            <li>As one&#x27;s eyesight goes bad, an excellent way to check to see &amp;</li>
            <li>Far too much eye strain for someone with 20/20.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a makeup mirror, although it&#x27;s great for tweezing eyebrows (and even eyelashes if you&#x27;re careful), because you can see to grip individual hairs with your tweezers.  </li>
            <li>This short distance doesn&#x27;t allow for comfortable space for fingers and tweezers (at least for me, anyway). :)</li>
            <li>It sure does take that long to be an expert plucking facial hair one at a time, made easier with this mirror.</li>
            <li>I need an extremely magnified mirror for plucking my extremely fine inward growing eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Determined not to look like my grandmother, I have been looking for the strong magnification mirror I needed to find every last white</li>
            <li>I have problems with eyelashes that grow backwards in toward the eye, this is the only mirror strong enough for me to see them and remove them.</li>
            <li>The focal length is so short that you have to get right up on it to reach the focal point.  </li>
            <li>You even see the tiniest spots in your face, not sure I always like that ha ha.. :)</li>
            <li>Magnification makes it hard to focus on a particular area, but with use comes better  knowledge of how to use it.</li>
            <li>Really too small to be of significant use.  </li>
            <li>Amaizing I can see details to my face clear.</li>
            <li>Could not get a clear image in this mirror.</li>
            <li>the view isn&#x27;t clear unless you have the mirror so close that it becomes unusable</li>
            <li>This mirror I have to play with to get to the correct angle to clearly see my eyes and eyebrows for plucking and applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this mirror to anyone who has problems seeing anything close-up on the face ...</li>
            <li>Complete waste of money if you are trying to pluck facial hair -- you will never be able to see the hair in the mirror to remove it.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I bought this small mirror to be able to inspect sun-damaged skin on my nose and face, in order to identify any tiny, possibly precancerous skin lesions that should be removed by my dermatologist if they should start to exhibit changes.  </li>
            <li>This little mirror is so powerful  </li>
            <li>It is the only way I can see my eye clearly .</li>
            <li>You have to focus directly in the middle of it, otherwise it can look distorted.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little small and strongly magnified for us older folks.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a real close look at my eye margins to see how inflamed and irritated they are due to a condition called ocular rosacea.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works very well for me,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also great for tweezing eyebrows or finding the random fuzzy or cat hair that has gotten into my eye, which I can painfully feel, but have not been able to see until now.  </li>
            <li>TOO much magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Should have got something less than the 20.</li>
            <li>Or at least made it a little bit better.</li>
            <li>Too small, power too high can&#x27;t see anything clearly....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Actually, it has almost no distortion except at the edges, which is understandable, and it fully lives up to its 20 power claim, being able to see even the tiniest eyebrow hair and eyelash in the eye.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what these aging eyes need.</li>
            <li> Very well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is almost too much magnification!  </li>
            <li> It is kind of hollow under the mirror so its needs more gentle care than a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so powerful you are looking at a whole new world never before seen!</li>
            <li> WOW, it&#x27;s magnification was bigger than I wanted, but great to really see every tiny hair and skin cell.  </li>
            <li> BUT the 3 suction cups that hold the mirror to another surface come apart easily and are already starting to flatten up therefore losing suction power  </li>
            <li> I can remove facial hair easily with a tweezer, which I am use to do for years.</li>
            <li> Extra strong for getting things out of an eye.</li>
            <li> This little mirror is the nicest mirror of its kind that I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to take a good look at your face with the shape of this mirror.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable considering  the magnification available locally is  8-10x max.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a travel mirror with this much magnification.  </li>
            <li> but really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Its an absolute must to have one of these mirrors.</li>
            <li> mirror does the trick very well.</li>
            <li> Really helps .</li>
            <li> The suction cups work VERY well</li>
            <li> But whenever you use this mirror, you must hold it very close.  </li>
            <li> Now this is REALLY 20 X Magnification.  </li>
            <li> use this mirror, you need to hold it close to your eyes and look straight into it.  </li>
            <li> It is very blurry up close.  </li>
            <li> Great for poor eyesight when trying to put on makeup.  </li>
            <li> This really is 20x magnification.  </li>
            <li> Swissco mirror claimed to be 20x, but is really about 15x.  </li>
            <li> Have to get up to mirror real close to visualize.  </li>
            <li> Its suction cups do work very well.  </li>
            <li> Can really see close up of your face</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> The backing on the mirror isn&#x27;t perfectly concave; it&#x27;s a little wavy creating a distorted reflection that I have to manuever around to find a focused small area.  </li>
            <li> For general purposes (e.g., applying eye makeup), a magnifying mirror with 5X magnification is a much better choice, because the 5X mirror will show a larger area of your face.</li>
            <li> This is the best little mirror under the sun and the magnification over 10X is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> and it is priced too high.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and when my # is too high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just a bit high a magnification</li>
            <li> As one&#x27;s eyesight goes bad, an excellent way to check to see &amp;</li>
            <li> Far too much eye strain for someone with 20/20.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a makeup mirror, although it&#x27;s great for tweezing eyebrows (and even eyelashes if you&#x27;re careful), because you can see to grip individual hairs with your tweezers.  </li>
            <li> This short distance doesn&#x27;t allow for comfortable space for fingers and tweezers (at least for me, anyway). :)</li>
            <li> It sure does take that long to be an expert plucking facial hair one at a time, made easier with this mirror.</li>
            <li> I need an extremely magnified mirror for plucking my extremely fine inward growing eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Determined not to look like my grandmother, I have been looking for the strong magnification mirror I needed to find every last white</li>
            <li> I have problems with eyelashes that grow backwards in toward the eye, this is the only mirror strong enough for me to see them and remove them.</li>
            <li> The focal length is so short that you have to get right up on it to reach the focal point.  </li>
            <li> You even see the tiniest spots in your face, not sure I always like that ha ha.. :)</li>
            <li> Magnification makes it hard to focus on a particular area, but with use comes better  knowledge of how to use it.</li>
            <li> Really too small to be of significant use.  </li>
            <li> Amaizing I can see details to my face clear.</li>
            <li> Could not get a clear image in this mirror.</li>
            <li> the view isn&#x27;t clear unless you have the mirror so close that it becomes unusable</li>
            <li> This mirror I have to play with to get to the correct angle to clearly see my eyes and eyebrows for plucking and applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this mirror to anyone who has problems seeing anything close-up on the face ...</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money if you are trying to pluck facial hair -- you will never be able to see the hair in the mirror to remove it.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I bought this small mirror to be able to inspect sun-damaged skin on my nose and face, in order to identify any tiny, possibly precancerous skin lesions that should be removed by my dermatologist if they should start to exhibit changes.  </li>
            <li> This little mirror is so powerful  </li>
            <li> It is the only way I can see my eye clearly .</li>
            <li> You have to focus directly in the middle of it, otherwise it can look distorted.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little small and strongly magnified for us older folks.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a real close look at my eye margins to see how inflamed and irritated they are due to a condition called ocular rosacea.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works very well for me,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also great for tweezing eyebrows or finding the random fuzzy or cat hair that has gotten into my eye, which I can painfully feel, but have not been able to see until now.  </li>
            <li> TOO much magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Should have got something less than the 20.</li>
            <li> Or at least made it a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Too small, power too high can&#x27;t see anything clearly....</li>
            <li> No matter how large the mirror is there seems to be only a small dime size spot where you can actually see anything.</li>
            <li> Only men in my culture shaves, the ethnicity of mine by nature are generally not too hairy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had luck over and over with the Danielle brand &amp; upset I wasted money trying a new brand!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but still better than no 20x at all.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the maker no longer has available.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I know it won&#x27;t be long before I find it shattered on the ground1  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a fairly minor</li>
            <li> May get dizzy if I focus for too long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more difficult than trying to tweeze your eyebrows with your glasses on, but you can&#x27;t see if you take them off!  </li>
            <li> My little magnification (probably 3 or 5x) hand mirror from a local store that I&#x27;d used for years just wasn&#x27;t enough anymore.  </li>
            <li> At 20X magnification, the ZADRO 20X SPOT MIRROR provides extreme facial closeups.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is really only in the very center of the mirror - the edges are blurry and can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Could not live without this now.  </li>
            <li> BAM...you can see EVERY SINGLE UNWANTED HAIR.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to get a full size pair of tweezers in between my eye and the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Can only see 1 eye at a time &amp; at an odd angle</li>
            <li> Thus it&#x27;s a mirror with very limited use.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little larger, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It is distorted and only a few areas that you can find focus on.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking at your eye, not very practical.</li>
            <li> Now I can see them, and carefully remove with the corner of a kleenix.  </li>
            <li> My slight quibble (slight indeed) was that the suction in the back didn&#x27;t always hold well</li>
            <li> I bought this because my eye sight is getting worse as I get older.</li>
            <li> small, very short focal length makes usefullness douptful:  </li>
            <li> like other people have mention here.</li>
            <li> I am extremely farsighted and couldn&#x27;t even think about doing my eyebrows without this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , if it had a small handle or stand option on it along with the suction cups on the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably on my 4rth mirror in two years because it brakes a lot faster than any other type of handheld mirror</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any distortions, as some other reviewers have complained about, but it does take a bit of work to hold it at the optimal distance, and this will change for different parts of your face (because they will be different distances from your eyes and from the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be warned that once you see your skin THIS magnified, you will have trouble believing that everyone else can&#x27;t see the microscopic details you&#x27;ve discovered.  </li>
            <li> Any other position and it&#x27;s blurry and you can&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li> so well  shows only small area</li>
            <li> not sure if that is good or bad!</li>
            <li> but this one is like looking in a funny mirror!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> You can not make out a thing unless you touch the mirror to your nose and even then the image is blury and dark.  </li>
            <li> This is a love hate thing I think.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t focus, the image is upside down and the mirror is concave.</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviews!</li>
            <li> Extreme Magnification Spot Mirror, you have saved my life!</li>
            <li> Mirror is concave, so it only works in one very small spot on the mirror.</li>
            <li> I was replacing a previous one I had gotten years ago.  </li>
            <li> It has suction cups on the back, but the overall size makes it difficult to use on a vanity mirror over bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> She says it is alright, but the mirror has a little distortion.</li>
            <li> These one is to little</li>
            <li> Having to lean over counter loses the clarity of magnification due to the distance.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but it is a little hard to focus.</li>
            <li> Being past menopause and blind as a bat, it is hard to track down the tough hairs on my face that have sprouted like kudzu since old age set in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s just on the small side.</li>
            <li> Too small to put your makeup on with.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> the downside, I&#x27;m not sure where to put this mirror.</li>
            <li> Small and lite.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small.  </li>
            <li> This one is small and fits in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to see with this mirror.  </li>
            <li> it can be a little scary to see every little detail on your face</li>
            <li> It is hard to focus, too blurry.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to see</li>
            <li> So I wish it had a handle on it, or at least a wider rim.  </li>
            <li> Very small in size</li>
            <li> This was the worst and most expensive mirror I have purchased in 20 yrs!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before however this one is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> When you combine this effect with typical middle-age presbyopia, it&#x27;s very difficult for me to see details close up.  </li>
            <li> but it has a weird shape to it</li>
            <li> The mirrior is absoulutly useless.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> So concaved it is useless.</li>
            <li> This becomes difficult leaning over sink area.</li>
            <li> Just received and I thought this item was quite expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to find a focal point.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my eyes are that bad</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a piece of crap, hopefully Amazon will geve me a refund</li>
            <li> If you have bad vision, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> These type of mirrors are awful!</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Terrible....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gives me a real close look at my eye margins to see how inflamed and irritated they are due to a condition called ocular rosacea. With warm compresses and lid scrubs I can relieve the condition some and with this mirror I am able to get a much better visual of what if any visible effect  these hygiene efforts are having.  The mirror works great.</li>
            <li> Very small in size and it is priced too high.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd magnifier I have bought. Tried to find in stores but local stores no longer stock it. Good on-line price.</li>
            <li> small, very short focal length makes usefullness douptful:  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> finally i can see those bugs?????? better smile!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror but it&#x27;s a little small and strongly magnified for us older folks.  I have to get so close that it begins to distort.  a 15x might be better for me, but I can&#x27;t find one like this.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.......you can see everything with this one........it magnifies more than I thought it could.. I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to take a good look at your face with the shape of this mirror. The magnification is great but it has a weird shape to it like other people have mention here.</li>
            <li> As one&#x27;s eyesight goes bad, an excellent way to check to see &amp;#34;all is OK&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too small, power too high can&#x27;t see anything clearly....</li>
            <li> Been looking for a travel mirror with this much magnification.  Only wish it came in a slightly bigger diameter.  However, that said, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Small mirror provides great magnification while fitting nicely in my make-up bag. I was expecting a larger product, but that was my &amp;#34;speed reading&amp;#34; error.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected. Magnification is great though!</li>
            <li> fits in my cosmetic pouch. take it on trips. perfect to see every detail in your face...so practical. Don&#x27;t forget to take it off the mirror before you leave....</li>
            <li> Oh boy, the things you can see</li>
            <li> Does magnify better than my 15x makeup mirror. Good for those with vision problems. Helps if you have a good light source to use it with. Suction cups stick well.</li>
            <li> The magnification is really only in the very center of the mirror - the edges are blurry and can&#x27;t be used. Which means your range of view is very tiny. I won&#x27;t buy this mirror again.</li>
            <li> The mirrior is absoulutly useless. It doesn&#x27;t focus, the image is upside down and the mirror is concave. I don&#x27;t know  what you would use it for. I sure can&#x27;t use it as a mirror. This mirror reminds me of what you would find in a house of mirrors at a carnaval.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for seeing closeup. I am extremely farsighted and couldn&#x27;t even think about doing my eyebrows without this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was a bigger, like 5 to 6 inches. I had looked all over the internet and this is the only 20x mirror I could find without&lt;br /&gt;the light in it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if it had a small handle or stand option on it along with the suction cups on the back. Other than that, it works very well for me,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just on the small side. You have to focus directly in the middle of it, otherwise it can look distorted.</li>
            <li> Suction cups do not work.  It keeps falling off of the mirror.</li>
            <li> These type of mirrors are awful! I see everything . This is a love hate thing I think. Get one and see what you have missed....lol</li>
            <li> It is the only way I can see my eye clearly . I have diabetes and when my # is too high I can not see.</li>
            <li> Amaizing I can see details to my face clear.The mirror is excellent</li>
            <li> Could not get a clear image in this mirror.</li>
            <li> received fast and as ordered great price , thanks</li>
            <li> este espejo se ve de todo, muchos poros y quede muy limpio jajajaj, this mirror is all, many pores and remains very clean jajajaj</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Exactly what I was wanting. Quick shipping, friendly service.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more difficult than trying to tweeze your eyebrows with your glasses on, but you can&#x27;t see if you take them off!  This is THE mirror to get if you wear reading glasses. True, you do have to tilt it a little to get a good view as others have said.  But boy, when you get the right tilt...BAM...you can see EVERY SINGLE UNWANTED HAIR.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li> optics are good for any porexic (you know who you are)  BUT the 3 suction cups that hold the mirror to another surface come apart easily and are already starting to flatten up therefore losing suction power  I know it won&#x27;t be long before I find it shattered on the ground1  very disappointed</li>
            <li> I though this would be good for removing ingrown hairs on my beard, but the farthest I could clearly see was my chin.  Far too much eye strain for someone with 20/20.</li>
            <li> Most of the magnification mirrors say 15 or 20X but really aren&#x27;t. I need these to insert and remove my contact lenses. These are the best ones. You even see the tiniest spots in your face, not sure I always like that ha ha.. :)</li>
            <li> Its an absolute must to have one of these mirrors. awesome for tweezing my eyebrows or removing blackheads or whatever else. It is kind of hollow under the mirror so its needs more gentle care than a regular mirror. I&#x27;m probably on my 4rth mirror in two years because it brakes a lot faster than any other type of handheld mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. Its sooooo worth it. You will see everythinggggg lol!</li>
            <li> Too small to put your makeup on with. Can only see 1 eye at a time &amp; at an odd angle</li>
            <li> Perfect for the folks who can&#x27;t see well--apply make up, tweeze your brows, see everything well</li>
            <li> With 20x magnification, you have to put your face right up against it and there is a lot of distortion.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth mirror from Zadro(2-10X and 2-20X) all mirrors are perfect no distortions in the reflectivity of the glass.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for seeing yourself up close and personal. What can I say, it is a mirror. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> TOO much magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Should have got something less than the 20.</li>
            <li> can actually see and get rid of unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li> Just a bit high a magnification but that is my fault</li>
            <li> She can see inside her pores!</li>
            <li> I find it hard to see with this mirror.  No matter how large the mirror is there seems to be only a small dime size spot where you can actually see anything.</li>
            <li> This was the worst and most expensive mirror I have purchased in 20 yrs! It is distorted and only a few areas that you can find focus on. I recommend the Danielle brand 18x or 20x mirror. I&#x27;ve had luck over and over with the Danielle brand &amp; upset I wasted money trying a new brand! Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This little mirror is the nicest mirror of its kind that I have ever found.  Actually, it has almost no distortion except at the edges, which is understandable, and it fully lives up to its 20 power claim, being able to see even the tiniest eyebrow hair and eyelash in the eye.  I use it all the time to check for something in my eye if I have a problem.  I would completely recommend this mirror to anyone who has problems seeing anything close-up on the face ... it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Being past menopause and blind as a bat, it is hard to track down the tough hairs on my face that have sprouted like kudzu since old age set in. Determined not to look like my grandmother, I have been looking for the strong magnification mirror I needed to find every last white hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror does the trick very well. The price for value is good, too. My slight quibble (slight indeed) was that the suction in the back didn&#x27;t always hold well (I place this mirror over my regular low magnification vanity mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this mirror and at last can see everything I need to see.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! This little mirror is so powerful  it can be a little scary to see every little detail on your face but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I need 1.75 readers for computer and 1.75 or 2.0 to read paper text or my phone.  This mirror provided only a tiny, fleeting portion of usable magnified space.  After a couple of frustraring weeks it went to the donation bix.  I recently found a great mini 20x lighted (!!) magnification mirror at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my eye sight is getting worse as I get older. Really helps .</li>
            <li> This mirror is so powerful you are looking at a whole new world never before seen! Excellent product and works well.</li>
            <li> Great and a nice size for travel!</li>
            <li> I have problems with eyelashes that grow backwards in toward the eye, this is the only mirror strong enough for me to see them and remove them.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it for her make up. She says it is alright, but the mirror has a little distortion.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find a focal point.  Useless.</li>
            <li> Exactly what these aging eyes need.</li>
            <li> Too small. I can&#x27;t even see in it!</li>
            <li> Too small so small that you practically bring it almost touching your face to see something then either you can hold the mirror or the tweezer&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back</li>
            <li> This mirror lets you see every detail on your face.  If there is a clogged pore, you&#x27;ll see it.  It is not large, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Great product, works like it should.  Very well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> AWFUL. So concaved it is useless. Complete waste of money if you are trying to pluck facial hair -- you will never be able to see the hair in the mirror to remove it.</li>
            <li> I wear a very strong contact prescription, which has the effect of making things close appear smaller and lighter.  When you combine this effect with typical middle-age presbyopia, it&#x27;s very difficult for me to see details close up.  My little magnification (probably 3 or 5x) hand mirror from a local store that I&#x27;d used for years just wasn&#x27;t enough anymore.  Thus began my search for something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, this baby is STRONG.  It&#x27;s so strong, in fact, that you might need some practice using it.  I don&#x27;t see any distortions, as some other reviewers have complained about, but it does take a bit of work to hold it at the optimal distance, and this will change for different parts of your face (because they will be different distances from your eyes and from the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be warned that once you see your skin THIS magnified, you will have trouble believing that everyone else can&#x27;t see the microscopic details you&#x27;ve discovered.  You&#x27;re going to see things you didn&#x27;t even know were there.  And once you see them, you can&#x27;t forget them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, I&#x27;m not sure where to put this mirror. The suction cups work VERY well; in fact, after I stuck this on my vanity mirror, I couldn&#x27;t get it off again (use a nail file or something similar to poke each suction cup to make it release).  But whenever you use this mirror, you must hold it very close.  And if I lean up that close to my vanity mirror, my lighting isn&#x27;t as good.  I think I just prefer to use this as a hand mirror.  So I wish it had a handle on it, or at least a wider rim.  But that&#x27;s a fairly minor consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great mirror for those of us who really struggle to see things close up.</li>
            <li> Now this is REALLY 20 X Magnification.  I ordered another brand on Amazon that claimed to be 20 X, but was more like 15 X.&lt;br /&gt;I can see EVERYTHING with this mirror.  I wish it were a little larger, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> At 20X magnification, the ZADRO 20X SPOT MIRROR provides extreme facial closeups.  It&#x27;s not really a makeup mirror, although it&#x27;s great for tweezing eyebrows (and even eyelashes if you&#x27;re careful), because you can see to grip individual hairs with your tweezers.  I bought this small mirror to be able to inspect sun-damaged skin on my nose and face, in order to identify any tiny, possibly precancerous skin lesions that should be removed by my dermatologist if they should start to exhibit changes.  For this purpose, the 20X magnification is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this mirror, you need to hold it close to your eyes and look straight into it.  Otherwise you can&#x27;t see a focused image.  Thus it&#x27;s a mirror with very limited use.  For general purposes (e.g., applying eye makeup), a magnifying mirror with 5X magnification is a much better choice, because the 5X mirror will show a larger area of your face.</li>
            <li> It is very blurry up close.  I was replacing a previous one I had gotten years ago.  Same Brand name and 20x, but this one is like looking in a funny mirror!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the ultra magnification to check out what&#x27;s in your facial skin. I can remove facial hair easily with a tweezer, which I am use to do for years. It sure does take that long to be an expert plucking facial hair one at a time, made easier with this mirror. Only men in my culture shaves, the ethnicity of mine by nature are generally not too hairy. The mirror is good to have for anybody just to check closely what&#x27;s going on with your facial skin.</li>
            <li> I added this to my husband&#x27;s bathroom mirror.  He uses it every day.</li>
            <li> This mirror is tiny.  You have to be 3 inches from it in order to see anything.  Unless you&#x27;re looking at your eye, not very practical.</li>
            <li> Could not live without this now.  Make up is so easy and it attaches to surfaces well&lt;br /&gt;so that you don&#x27;t have to hold it.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE. Mirror is concave, so it only works in one very small spot on the mirror. Any other position and it&#x27;s blurry and you can&#x27;t see anything. Listen to the other reviews! Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Extra strong for getting things out of an eye. Small and lite.Had one before. Good.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product,it does its job 20 times is amazing i would recommend it.it is a strong mini Mirrow,cool</li>
            <li> The mirror is small, which is perfect for a purse. It has suction cups on the back, but the overall size makes it difficult to use on a vanity mirror over bathroom sink. Having to lean over counter loses the clarity of magnification due to the distance. This is a mirror you need to hold to get the benefit of the strong magnification. Good product.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before however this one is very hard to use. It is hard to focus, too blurry.  I actually got use to using this, not sure if that is good or bad!</li>
            <li> I have blepharitis and this mirror is a lifesaver.  With it, I am able to see that I have completely cleaned my eyelids.  I am now buying a second one just to travel with.</li>
            <li> Very nice, good finish and will recommend this :)</li>
            <li> These one is to little</li>
            <li> WOW, it&#x27;s magnification was bigger than I wanted, but great to really see every tiny hair and skin cell.  If you have bad vision, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Excellent and so useful.</li>
            <li> Too small. I wish I would have paid closer attention to the size.</li>
            <li> Great for poor eyesight when trying to put on makeup.  Price was reasonable considering  the magnification available locally is  8-10x max.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and service.</li>
            <li> The mirror is toooooo strong. I can see my skin clearly!!!!! I will recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Good for all my needs for a magnifying mirror.  The reflection is good quality</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  It helps me see what my Magic Focus Big Eyes Mirror doesn&#x27;t allow me to see...would buy again.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is almost too much magnification!  My skin looks like the surface of the moon!  This is very nice and the price was excellent!</li>
            <li> My bride loves it.  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I need an extremely magnified mirror for plucking my extremely fine inward growing eyelashes.  The mirror is too small.  May get dizzy if I focus for too long.</li>
            <li> Terrible.... the view isn&#x27;t clear unless you have the mirror so close that it becomes unusable</li>
            <li> This really is 20x magnification.  Swissco mirror claimed to be 20x, but is really about 15x.  I had a Zadro for about 10 years but it fell of my mirror and I stepped on it.  This one isn&#x27;t as good as my old one.  The backing on the mirror isn&#x27;t perfectly concave; it&#x27;s a little wavy creating a distorted reflection that I have to manuever around to find a focused small area.  Disappointing, but still better than no 20x at all.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product IF the mirror were larger.  Really too small to be of significant use.  Have to get up to mirror real close to visualize.  This becomes difficult leaning over sink area.</li>
            <li> Just received and I thought this item was quite expensive for what you get.  I have a older mirror that is a full hand held I purchased at walmart.  On the back it has a smaller 10x and 20x.  This thing is so well made but unfortunately the maker no longer has available.  So I was on the hunt.  This one is small and fits in the palm of my hand.  Its suction cups do work very well.  In magnified glasses I wear a 2.0 to 2.75.  This mirror I have to play with to get to the correct angle to clearly see my eyes and eyebrows for plucking and applying makeup.  It had many raving reviews so I passed on the tad bit cheaper one.  This one is angled and blurry for me.  Maybe my eyes are that bad but like I said I have a good one but needed one for work and on the road and this is okay</li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years I&#x27;d be writing a review on a mirror.  This mirror is a piece of crap, hopefully Amazon will geve me a refund even thought I threw away the packaging.  You can not make out a thing unless you touch the mirror to your nose and even then the image is blury and dark.  Since I cannot leave 0 stars I will leave 1.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes which grow into my eye and this mirror makes it possible for me to pluck them myself!  I wish I could find a larger diameter 20x mirror simply because I have to be so darn close to this mirror to focus. It is difficult to get a full size pair of tweezers in between my eye and the mirror.  (Thus the 4 stars and not 5.) For those of you looking for a good make-up mirror this is NOT for you. It is great for &amp;#34;zooming in&amp;#34; on a particular spot, not getting the whole picture.</li>
            <li> The 20x magnification is great for checking fine details of makeup (before putting in contacts or putting on glasses).  Also great for tweezing eyebrows or finding the random fuzzy or cat hair that has gotten into my eye, which I can painfully feel, but have not been able to see until now.  Now I can see them, and carefully remove with the corner of a kleenix.  I had a 15x which was sort of okay for make-up, but this one is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I found that this mirror was actually too powerful!  The focal length is so short that you have to get right up on it to reach the focal point.  This short distance doesn&#x27;t allow for comfortable space for fingers and tweezers (at least for me, anyway). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to buy a mirror for brow grooming, I recommend 12x instead.</li>
            <li> I Like this mirror but it is hard to see so well  shows only small area but it is 20 X</li>
            <li> this mirrow is very useful to get rid of the hairs incrusted in the skin after shaving !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. I can now see to get stuff out of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make that my aging eye which has now decided it can no longer see tiny print nor anything which has decided to alight in my eye and irritate the heck out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20X Extreme Magnification Spot Mirror, you have saved my life! Or at least made it a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Now I can to see to put on my makeup without necessarily having in my contacts. Without this mirror, I&#x27;m sunk.</li>
            <li> Magnification makes it hard to focus on a particular area, but with use comes better  knowledge of how to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and with vision problems and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best little mirror under the sun and the magnification over 10X is so hard to find.  I was so happy to have found this 20X mirrors!</li>
            <li> I bought it to remove chin hairs. I didnt realize the size will not allow that.  Should send it back.</li>
            <li> Can really see close up of your face</li>
            <li> Lots of magnification.  Makes wife&#x27;s eyebrows look like trees.  Would be nice if they made a lighted version.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but it is a little hard to focus.</li>
