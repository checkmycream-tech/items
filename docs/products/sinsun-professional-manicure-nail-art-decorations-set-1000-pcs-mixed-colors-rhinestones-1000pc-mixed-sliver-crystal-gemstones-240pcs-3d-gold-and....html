            <li>Extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li>The nail polish dryer was easy to remove from the box, and it is quite attractive.</li>
            <li>however this light worked great...</li>
            <li>This led light works great.</li>
            <li>The motion sensor is a nice feature to  have.</li>
            <li>and anyway I liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice feature.</li>
            <li>doing my own nails has never been easier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that 90 &amp; 120 seconds cures Gelish product nicely.</li>
            <li>In all honestly, I should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li>It looked just as nice as the salon.  </li>
            <li>decided I could paint my own.  </li>
            <li>but when you are trying to multitask this is a really nice</li>
            <li>This fits the bill perfectly - good quality, attractive, solid, great coverage by the LED lights.</li>
            <li>Incredible fast!</li>
            <li>I received the USpicy quickly and am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love the motion sensor that turns on when you stick your hand in and I LOVE that I can cure one hand at a time!  </li>
            <li>Great work from Uspicy, totally worth my 5 stars.</li>
            <li>but I do like being able to do my own nails.</li>
            <li>but I do like being able to do my own nails.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was a great success - two weeks with the gel and my nails look great.</li>
            <li>Great product was exactly as described and performed like a charm</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>I gel my nails almost once a week. :-)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;three times and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the preset timer</li>
            <li>Love the automatic start when you put your hand in the unit.</li>
            <li>I love this nail dryer.</li>
            <li>Make sure when your buying polish that it is LED compatible.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>She still raves about this product and calls it the best gift she received all last year!</li>
            <li>Better than jewelry.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that its led</li>
            <li>Love the sensor on feature...very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>I especially love that it has a motion sensor, so the 30 second timer starts</li>
            <li>I was able to wash dishes &amp; do laundry</li>
            <li>and I believe the polish is staying on even better than before.  </li>
            <li>This lamp has saved me a lot of money, and I&#x27;m enjoying having control over my nails again.</li>
            <li>Love that it automatically turns on when I insert my hand.</li>
            <li>nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the better ones on the market.  </li>
            <li>2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat.</li>
            <li>I did cure each coat for 90 seconds or more.</li>
            <li>just used his last night and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>I did 30 seconds for each layer until the &#x27;top it off&#x27; top layer where I did 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hands in.  </li>
            <li>I used to do 2 minutes per layer with my UV, then 3 minutes for the top layer.  </li>
            <li>I love the time savings.</li>
            <li>Must try!:)</li>
            <li>Went with Gelish version and pleased with its size.</li>
            <li>So I know how to get the most out of these dryers.</li>
            <li>So make sure</li>
            <li>I love the style of this product.</li>
            <li>i did my nails and they lasted for more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with cnd shellac and with most colors it did harden the polish onto my nails.  </li>
            <li>Without a lab test you can&#x27;t know for sure.  </li>
            <li>and i love the auto timer feature</li>
            <li>I love its shape as well.  </li>
            <li>Dries much better than uv lamps.  </li>
            <li>Have both love the led lamp.  </li>
            <li>Seems that the nail polish seals better for a longer stay.</li>
            <li>I wanted an led light I could fit my whole hand into this is amazing and works great</li>
            <li>The machine is soooo easy to use automatic on and off when you put your hand in multi time setting and the machine is sooo DARN CUTE.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this light, sets my gel polish faster and better than the UV.</li>
            <li>i now think that the top coat is the most important one</li>
            <li>So far it is working great.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time researching products and reviews and am very happy with the person I bought this from and the service I received.</li>
            <li>far, this model is working perfect, even for the higher price I paid.</li>
            <li>I just hope that I can learn how to make it 30 sec for each layer  -- which will be awesome.</li>
            <li>I figured I would recoup the money in not having to go to a nail salon and so far I’ve been happy with this purchase.there you have it.</li>
            <li>I figured I would recoup the money in not having to go to a nail salon and so far I’ve been happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is when the switch is on and you put your hands under the light it automatically goes on.</li>
            <li>Came in nicely packages, worked nicely right away  registered on line for the extended warranty.</li>
            <li>It works flawlessly, the timer is right, the price is right, and it is clean looking and pretty.</li>
            <li>So excited to be able to do my nails myself and save $$$$.</li>
            <li>The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li>this is such a great LED light!  </li>
            <li>Again as in my other review this light is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>But once the lamp was on for a little bit it worked great!</li>
            <li>I set the light on the ground and just slipped my foot in.</li>
            <li>The actual LED Nail Polish dryer is built well and works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my light that takes 3 minutes to set each layer.  </li>
            <li>My nails look fantastic.</li>
            <li>The light inside still work</li>
            <li>That is not an important feature for me, so I did not return it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this nail drier.</li>
            <li>Light comes on automatically when you put you hand in.  </li>
            <li>I have a UV light and wanted a LED light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this light.</li>
            <li>The light turns on when you stick your hand in.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I read that the LED light is still UV light</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This light is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success.</li>
            <li>There is an information/direction guide and a very useful emory board/nail</li>
            <li>Not bad - it worked just fine, but I wanted to reduce the risk of UV-related skin damage</li>
            <li>I originally bought the NOVA one  ($199) and it took forever to cure</li>
            <li>I am super excited to have one of these and have been waiting to take the plunge and purchase an LED curing light.</li>
            <li>It worked good however after my last light died</li>
            <li>It is lightweight; easy to operate; its auto-on feature is very \\&quot;handy\\&quot;; dries my Gelish more quickly than the UV units; and I&#x27;m not bumping my nails within its well-designed interior.</li>
            <li>Read many positive reviews on the USpicy Crescent LED Nail Dryer and decided to give at home gel manicures a try.</li>
            <li>thank you very much to the ones who said that any 70% alcohol will do to remove any excess in the end; yes very true</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fast, and it works fine!</li>
            <li>Inside the box was an attractive pink box holding the nail polish dryer, well packaged between sponge layers.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second one to provide better more comfortable , faster service in my salon.  </li>
            <li>Cures evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>so apply a lot of the top coat especially on the top of the nail all the way to the edges, as this helps ensure the polish does not peel off (it seals it).</li>
            <li>It is spacious, I can fit my whole hand underneath the dryer/lights comfortably.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take long and nails stay good for 10-14 days depending on what your job is.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid gel uv light!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much faster the LED light was.  </li>
            <li>The drying is fast and I don&#x27;t need any gloves since it is not a UV light.</li>
            <li>but I do about 90 sec after the top layer just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>If finding a space for it isn&#x27;t an issue then it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I will follow up when I get more comfortable with the polish and the process.</li>
            <li>After 2 month of use, I finally decided to get one for myself to save me traveling and start my own manicures at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this lamp for OPI Gelcolor and have been satisfied with my purchase thus far (~2 mo.</li>
            <li>but I do follow the official OPI instructions to the best of my ability (nail bed prep, thin coats</li>
            <li>I inserted my right hand into the curing window.</li>
            <li>It is a small unit which is great for me because I use the unit at home and it fits in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this dryer one time &amp; I&#x27;m still wearing the same polish (it&#x27;s been one week &amp; so far so good).  </li>
            <li>It works very fast.</li>
            <li>First, the LED dryers in general seemed to seem to have more positive reviews as opposed to the UV type of dryers.</li>
            <li>I ordered the white lamp (I love that you can choose your color)</li>
            <li>I like the different timer settings and that the controls are on top of the lamp.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for in a gel nail dryer.  </li>
            <li>Cures Gelish, OPI, and many others, simply follow product recommendation for times.</li>
            <li>first unit ordered from this seller came and appeared to be used or so.</li>
            <li>You can tell this is a well made lamp that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>And the dryer worked exactly like the salon dryer my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; nail technician used.</li>
            <li>(I wished I had known about LED machines first -</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they existed until after this purchase), so I decided to purchase an LED machine.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is a very well made product!  </li>
            <li>So nice to not have to touch anything with you wet nails.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>when I did more research i found that shellac will look and feel cured at only 55% done.  </li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d say it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I add an extra 90s cycle to each of the color coats and top</li>
            <li>I love this LED Lamp, it cures gel nail polish quickly and all ten fingers can fit in to it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>first so I can end on a positive note:&lt;br /&gt;-Works</li>
            <li>In about the 3 times you go to the salon to get a gel manicure you can invest your money and buy one of these all the other supplies and do YOUR nails YOUR way in YOUR own HOME.</li>
            <li>Big enough to fit both my feet at the same time great cresent shape for your whole hand.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say anything positive about the Uspicy LED lamp.</li>
            <li>and I wonder if any nail polish would work as long as the top coat is applied;</li>
            <li>i purchased this item after trying several other products that were similar and im very happy with the product&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a year and a half using Gelish.  </li>
            <li>I  used a large UV lamp before, it took 2 minutes to 3 minutes for each coat</li>
            <li>When I am very careful and keep the polish from going on my cuticles or skin, it gets a great seal and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>That made doing a gel pedicure so much easier.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and I have used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li>Fast drying</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would care so much about having a timer or motion sensor but both things are very convenient and the dryer works well.  </li>
            <li>It dries gels fast.</li>
            <li>And fits your whole hand or foot at once.</li>
            <li>Really sets the gel</li>
            <li>Recomendable for fast and quit jobs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use this with gelish, and it works like a charm, really took time off my manicure.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it works with both UV and LED polish systems.  </li>
            <li>I am currently giving the light 4 stars for curing time...</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>The automatic timer and hand sensor are very convenient features.</li>
            <li>After spending so much on quality shellac colors, I don&#x27;t want to chance it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks USpicy.</li>
            <li>fast but does not work as fast as the $300+ OPI lamp</li>
            <li>So mad at myself for getting rid of the box and even more pissed that I trusted all this products good reviews on Amazon  </li>
            <li>(need to put one hand on top of the other).  </li>
            <li>right after bacause my nails were super dry.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure this cures my nails in half the time!  </li>
            <li>You must make sure you do not get any polish outside of the nail bed, otherwise it will simply peel off.  </li>
            <li>O M G...if you are still using the older UV lamps for your gel polish...upgrade to the LED.  </li>
            <li>This particular model had a timer, which allows you to choose between 30, 60 and 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would order it again if I needed another one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but the timer is dead, also the product feel very cheap and light.&lt;br /&gt;However the does it job and cure the gel polish well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product, the process and the supplier.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li>But if you carefully insert the toes, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let the lamp heat up a little bit.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pretty large for a nail polish dryer.  </li>
            <li>The leds do emit uv light so they can cure a wide variety of polishes.  </li>
            <li>So far, the LED lamp works very well.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that if I don’t cure them long enough the color at the edge of the nail will rub off or the top coat won’t come out as shiny</li>
            <li>You can fit your whole hand in and I like the count down timer.</li>
            <li>I have used this a couple times so far with gelish polish and even after waiting for over 3 minutes under the light they still won&#x27;t dry!</li>
            <li>The other nice thing about this lamp is that it is large enough to stick your entire hand or foot in at one time.</li>
            <li>i decided it would be better if i just bit the bullet and spent alittle extra money for name brand  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as I had thought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also big enough to fit almost your two hands and your toes too.</li>
            <li>This certainly isn&#x27;t a lot of time in general (about an hour</li>
            <li>I am so glad I spend a little extra and purchased real quality.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned on, it was to constant on setting.</li>
            <li>Works just like the professional salon!</li>
            <li>It is a tight fit</li>
            <li>so this will cut down my time for nails significantly.</li>
            <li>I am a home user, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for something heavy-duty and professional.</li>
            <li>There is a beep, but it isn&#x27;t that loud</li>
            <li>The display elements do not work properly so you have no idea how much time you&#x27;re setting it for or time remaining.</li>
            <li>Has not held up as far as the interior.</li>
            <li>My first run I was worried because it was taking so long to cure the polish.</li>
            <li>Old because I can now do this myself and save money.</li>
            <li>but when I learned how much faster the LED machines are, it was a big plus!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The time display does show the numbers completely sometimes.</li>
            <li>But that is far from the headache of lacquer</li>
            <li>The actual nail dryer is bigger than it looked in the pictures, it can fit my two hands at the same time.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
            <li>Works (thus far) like a champ.  </li>
            <li>I listed the times that have worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>You know how much time is left</li>
            <li>I liked the machine, just not sure how well it keeps it so dry and not pealing off in 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the additional money upfront, listened to other reviewers and purchased this LED gel nail polish dryer.</li>
            <li>The their benefit, however, I am not a professional and am not 100% positive I am applying the gel polish correctly.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s still a slight improvement in terms of  time for this LED light when I put two hands in at the same time.  </li>
            <li>and it is uses LEDs for the light which can last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>I use Gelish &amp; a few other brands and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Certain polymers only react to certain wavelengths and few companies post that info.  </li>
            <li>It has a very large opening so there is less of a chance of bumping your mani/pedi before you cure it.</li>
            <li>If using a dark color make sure to leave under the lights a little longer.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this twice so far</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how big it was.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times -</li>
            <li>It does seem to be a true LED, I usually cure for two 30-second sessions for each coat.</li>
            <li>Much of the side area is not used for curing so it seems cumbersome - as other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>some say the nail polish does not dry.</li>
            <li>Secondly, this particular dryer, even though it was more expensive, was a current model (looked like it had recently been released).</li>
            <li>and I’d say I have average size hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;-I really like the countdown timer.</li>
            <li>Although I do not find I am getting the fast drying times as others have stated in previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Seriously, when I only have a couple gel nails to repair, I use the 100w LED light bulb I bought from my nearest store, plug it into any household lamp, and just hold my nail next to the lit bulb for a minute until the gel dries.</li>

            <li> The motion sensor is a nice feature to  have.</li>
            <li> and anyway I liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice feature.</li>
            <li> doing my own nails has never been easier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that 90 &amp; 120 seconds cures Gelish product nicely.</li>
            <li> In all honestly, I should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li> It looked just as nice as the salon.  </li>
            <li> decided I could paint my own.  </li>
            <li> but when you are trying to multitask this is a really nice</li>
            <li> This fits the bill perfectly - good quality, attractive, solid, great coverage by the LED lights.</li>
            <li> Incredible fast!</li>
            <li> I received the USpicy quickly and am very pleased with it!</li>

            <li> Great work from Uspicy, totally worth my 5 stars.</li>
            <li> but I do like being able to do my own nails.</li>
            <li> but I do like being able to do my own nails.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was a great success - two weeks with the gel and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> Great product was exactly as described and performed like a charm</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> I gel my nails almost once a week. :-)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;three times and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> Love the automatic start when you put your hand in the unit.</li>
            <li> I love this nail dryer.</li>
            <li> Make sure when your buying polish that it is LED compatible.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> She still raves about this product and calls it the best gift she received all last year!</li>
            <li> Better than jewelry.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love that its led</li>
            <li> Love the sensor on feature...very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> I especially love that it has a motion sensor, so the 30 second timer starts</li>
            <li> I was able to wash dishes &amp; do laundry</li>
            <li> and I believe the polish is staying on even better than before.  </li>
            <li> This lamp has saved me a lot of money, and I&#x27;m enjoying having control over my nails again.</li>
            <li> Love that it automatically turns on when I insert my hand.</li>
            <li> nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the better ones on the market.  </li>
            <li> 2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat.</li>
            <li> I did cure each coat for 90 seconds or more.</li>
            <li> just used his last night and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> I did 30 seconds for each layer until the &#x27;top it off&#x27; top layer where I did 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hands in.  </li>
            <li> I used to do 2 minutes per layer with my UV, then 3 minutes for the top layer.  </li>
            <li> I love the time savings.</li>
            <li> Must try!:)</li>
            <li> Went with Gelish version and pleased with its size.</li>
            <li> So I know how to get the most out of these dryers.</li>
            <li> So make sure</li>
            <li> I love the style of this product.</li>
            <li> i did my nails and they lasted for more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with cnd shellac and with most colors it did harden the polish onto my nails.  </li>
            <li> Without a lab test you can&#x27;t know for sure.  </li>
            <li> and i love the auto timer feature</li>
            <li> I love its shape as well.  </li>
            <li> Dries much better than uv lamps.  </li>
            <li> Have both love the led lamp.  </li>
            <li> Seems that the nail polish seals better for a longer stay.</li>
            <li> I wanted an led light I could fit my whole hand into this is amazing and works great</li>
            <li> The machine is soooo easy to use automatic on and off when you put your hand in multi time setting and the machine is sooo DARN CUTE.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this light, sets my gel polish faster and better than the UV.</li>
            <li> i now think that the top coat is the most important one</li>
            <li> So far it is working great.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching products and reviews and am very happy with the person I bought this from and the service I received.</li>
            <li> far, this model is working perfect, even for the higher price I paid.</li>
            <li> I just hope that I can learn how to make it 30 sec for each layer  -- which will be awesome.</li>
            <li> I figured I would recoup the money in not having to go to a nail salon and so far I’ve been happy with this purchase.there you have it.</li>
            <li> I figured I would recoup the money in not having to go to a nail salon and so far I’ve been happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is when the switch is on and you put your hands under the light it automatically goes on.</li>
            <li> Came in nicely packages, worked nicely right away  registered on line for the extended warranty.</li>
            <li> It works flawlessly, the timer is right, the price is right, and it is clean looking and pretty.</li>
            <li> So excited to be able to do my nails myself and save $$$$.</li>
            <li> The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li> this is such a great LED light!  </li>
            <li> Again as in my other review this light is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> But once the lamp was on for a little bit it worked great!</li>
            <li> I set the light on the ground and just slipped my foot in.</li>
            <li> The actual LED Nail Polish dryer is built well and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my light that takes 3 minutes to set each layer.  </li>
            <li> My nails look fantastic.</li>
            <li> The light inside still work</li>
            <li> That is not an important feature for me, so I did not return it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this nail drier.</li>
            <li> Light comes on automatically when you put you hand in.  </li>
            <li> I have a UV light and wanted a LED light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this light.</li>
            <li> The light turns on when you stick your hand in.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I read that the LED light is still UV light</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This light is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success.</li>
            <li> There is an information/direction guide and a very useful emory board/nail</li>
            <li> Not bad - it worked just fine, but I wanted to reduce the risk of UV-related skin damage</li>
            <li> I originally bought the NOVA one  ($199) and it took forever to cure</li>
            <li> I am super excited to have one of these and have been waiting to take the plunge and purchase an LED curing light.</li>
            <li> It worked good however after my last light died</li>
            <li> It is lightweight; easy to operate; its auto-on feature is very \\&quot;handy\\&quot;; dries my Gelish more quickly than the UV units; and I&#x27;m not bumping my nails within its well-designed interior.</li>
            <li> Read many positive reviews on the USpicy Crescent LED Nail Dryer and decided to give at home gel manicures a try.</li>
            <li> thank you very much to the ones who said that any 70% alcohol will do to remove any excess in the end; yes very true</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fast, and it works fine!</li>
            <li> Inside the box was an attractive pink box holding the nail polish dryer, well packaged between sponge layers.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one to provide better more comfortable , faster service in my salon.  </li>
            <li> Cures evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> so apply a lot of the top coat especially on the top of the nail all the way to the edges, as this helps ensure the polish does not peel off (it seals it).</li>
            <li> It is spacious, I can fit my whole hand underneath the dryer/lights comfortably.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long and nails stay good for 10-14 days depending on what your job is.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid gel uv light!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much faster the LED light was.  </li>
            <li> The drying is fast and I don&#x27;t need any gloves since it is not a UV light.</li>
            <li> but I do about 90 sec after the top layer just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> If finding a space for it isn&#x27;t an issue then it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I will follow up when I get more comfortable with the polish and the process.</li>
            <li> After 2 month of use, I finally decided to get one for myself to save me traveling and start my own manicures at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this lamp for OPI Gelcolor and have been satisfied with my purchase thus far (~2 mo.</li>
            <li> but I do follow the official OPI instructions to the best of my ability (nail bed prep, thin coats</li>
            <li> I inserted my right hand into the curing window.</li>
            <li> It is a small unit which is great for me because I use the unit at home and it fits in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer one time &amp; I&#x27;m still wearing the same polish (it&#x27;s been one week &amp; so far so good).  </li>
            <li> It works very fast.</li>
            <li> First, the LED dryers in general seemed to seem to have more positive reviews as opposed to the UV type of dryers.</li>
            <li> I ordered the white lamp (I love that you can choose your color)</li>
            <li> I like the different timer settings and that the controls are on top of the lamp.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for in a gel nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> Cures Gelish, OPI, and many others, simply follow product recommendation for times.</li>
            <li> first unit ordered from this seller came and appeared to be used or so.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is a well made lamp that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li> And the dryer worked exactly like the salon dryer my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; nail technician used.</li>
            <li> (I wished I had known about LED machines first -</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they existed until after this purchase), so I decided to purchase an LED machine.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product!  </li>
            <li> So nice to not have to touch anything with you wet nails.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> when I did more research i found that shellac will look and feel cured at only 55% done.  </li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d say it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I add an extra 90s cycle to each of the color coats and top</li>
            <li> I love this LED Lamp, it cures gel nail polish quickly and all ten fingers can fit in to it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> first so I can end on a positive note:&lt;br /&gt;-Works</li>
            <li> In about the 3 times you go to the salon to get a gel manicure you can invest your money and buy one of these all the other supplies and do YOUR nails YOUR way in YOUR own HOME.</li>
            <li> Big enough to fit both my feet at the same time great cresent shape for your whole hand.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything positive about the Uspicy LED lamp.</li>
            <li> and I wonder if any nail polish would work as long as the top coat is applied;</li>
            <li> i purchased this item after trying several other products that were similar and im very happy with the product&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a year and a half using Gelish.  </li>
            <li> I  used a large UV lamp before, it took 2 minutes to 3 minutes for each coat</li>
            <li> When I am very careful and keep the polish from going on my cuticles or skin, it gets a great seal and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> That made doing a gel pedicure so much easier.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and I have used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li> Fast drying</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would care so much about having a timer or motion sensor but both things are very convenient and the dryer works well.  </li>
            <li> It dries gels fast.</li>
            <li> And fits your whole hand or foot at once.</li>
            <li> Really sets the gel</li>
            <li> Recomendable for fast and quit jobs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this with gelish, and it works like a charm, really took time off my manicure.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it works with both UV and LED polish systems.  </li>
            <li> I am currently giving the light 4 stars for curing time...</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> The automatic timer and hand sensor are very convenient features.</li>
            <li> After spending so much on quality shellac colors, I don&#x27;t want to chance it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks USpicy.</li>
            <li> fast but does not work as fast as the $300+ OPI lamp</li>
            <li> So mad at myself for getting rid of the box and even more pissed that I trusted all this products good reviews on Amazon  </li>
            <li> (need to put one hand on top of the other).  </li>
            <li> right after bacause my nails were super dry.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure this cures my nails in half the time!  </li>
            <li> You must make sure you do not get any polish outside of the nail bed, otherwise it will simply peel off.  </li>
            <li> O M G...if you are still using the older UV lamps for your gel polish...upgrade to the LED.  </li>
            <li> This particular model had a timer, which allows you to choose between 30, 60 and 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would order it again if I needed another one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but the timer is dead, also the product feel very cheap and light.&lt;br /&gt;However the does it job and cure the gel polish well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product, the process and the supplier.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> But if you carefully insert the toes, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Make sure to let the lamp heat up a little bit.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pretty large for a nail polish dryer.  </li>
            <li> The leds do emit uv light so they can cure a wide variety of polishes.  </li>
            <li> So far, the LED lamp works very well.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I don’t cure them long enough the color at the edge of the nail will rub off or the top coat won’t come out as shiny</li>
            <li> You can fit your whole hand in and I like the count down timer.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times so far with gelish polish and even after waiting for over 3 minutes under the light they still won&#x27;t dry!</li>
            <li> The other nice thing about this lamp is that it is large enough to stick your entire hand or foot in at one time.</li>
            <li> i decided it would be better if i just bit the bullet and spent alittle extra money for name brand  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as I had thought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also big enough to fit almost your two hands and your toes too.</li>
            <li> This certainly isn&#x27;t a lot of time in general (about an hour</li>
            <li> I am so glad I spend a little extra and purchased real quality.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned on, it was to constant on setting.</li>
            <li> Works just like the professional salon!</li>
            <li> It is a tight fit</li>
            <li> so this will cut down my time for nails significantly.</li>
            <li> I am a home user, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for something heavy-duty and professional.</li>
            <li> There is a beep, but it isn&#x27;t that loud</li>
            <li> The display elements do not work properly so you have no idea how much time you&#x27;re setting it for or time remaining.</li>
            <li> Has not held up as far as the interior.</li>
            <li> My first run I was worried because it was taking so long to cure the polish.</li>
            <li> Old because I can now do this myself and save money.</li>
            <li> but when I learned how much faster the LED machines are, it was a big plus!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The time display does show the numbers completely sometimes.</li>
            <li> But that is far from the headache of lacquer</li>
            <li> The actual nail dryer is bigger than it looked in the pictures, it can fit my two hands at the same time.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
            <li> Works (thus far) like a champ.  </li>
            <li> I listed the times that have worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> You know how much time is left</li>
            <li> I liked the machine, just not sure how well it keeps it so dry and not pealing off in 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the additional money upfront, listened to other reviewers and purchased this LED gel nail polish dryer.</li>
            <li> The their benefit, however, I am not a professional and am not 100% positive I am applying the gel polish correctly.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s still a slight improvement in terms of  time for this LED light when I put two hands in at the same time.  </li>
            <li> and it is uses LEDs for the light which can last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I use Gelish &amp; a few other brands and it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Certain polymers only react to certain wavelengths and few companies post that info.  </li>
            <li> It has a very large opening so there is less of a chance of bumping your mani/pedi before you cure it.</li>
            <li> If using a dark color make sure to leave under the lights a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how big it was.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times -</li>
            <li> It does seem to be a true LED, I usually cure for two 30-second sessions for each coat.</li>
            <li> Much of the side area is not used for curing so it seems cumbersome - as other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> some say the nail polish does not dry.</li>
            <li> Secondly, this particular dryer, even though it was more expensive, was a current model (looked like it had recently been released).</li>
            <li> and I’d say I have average size hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;-I really like the countdown timer.</li>
            <li> Although I do not find I am getting the fast drying times as others have stated in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Seriously, when I only have a couple gel nails to repair, I use the 100w LED light bulb I bought from my nearest store, plug it into any household lamp, and just hold my nail next to the lit bulb for a minute until the gel dries.</li>
            <li> The machine also automatically starts to count down when you put your hands into it, so it helps to keep track of how much time your hands spent in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it is little bit expensive, but you will love it!</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed by how long it took to do a simple manicure with the LED lamp.</li>
            <li> 30 seconds per layer is long enough for this brand.</li>
            <li> and I hope it will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it takes a bit long to cure the nail.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is tired of paying high prices and the salon.</li>
            <li> then i realized that until one puts the final coat the nails wont be completely dry.</li>
            <li> I tried to do only 30 seconds and it will be soft and peeled off in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I try too keep my hands quiet for an hour or so while my nails completely dry, but found that after 15 minutes, my nails felt completely dry.</li>
            <li> It only takes 30 sec.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> Also note, I&#x27;m a do-it-yourself nail person, not a professional nail technician.</li>
            <li> It cured my nails faster than the NOVA one, which is no longer on the site) but still took a long time:  </li>
            <li> The back switch flips both up and down and you&#x27;ll get the timer only on one way.</li>
            <li> Third, it was the only dryer that I saw that had a count down timer.</li>
            <li> If it holds up to it&#x27;s advertising about how long it will work, I&#x27;ll be a fan for life!</li>
            <li> They dry with no sheet marks I can pick up my keys and get on the move.</li>
            <li> At the end of 90 seconds the polish felt dry.</li>
            <li> Within another 90 seconds, I had both sets of nails dry.</li>
            <li> to dry.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, air bubbles and dry time...</li>
            <li> Returned it because I didn&#x27;t like the shape, design, and longer dry times.</li>
            <li> so it takes longer to dry out.</li>
            <li> use it for the fist time, it wouldn&#x27;t dry my nails.  </li>
            <li> It’s kind of annoying and not necessary at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a single beep.</li>
            <li> I usually have a complete manicure monthly, and in the summer I have a pedicure monthly.</li>
            <li> I do 30 second coats and a 60  second base coat just to be safe.</li>
            <li> READ the directions because it confused me at first.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> I use it with gelish and China gelaze, nails are dry in seconds!</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 minutes per coat, which is the same as the UV lamp I previously used.</li>
            <li> Plus less potential skin damage (</li>
            <li> My Gelish polish takes maybe 30 minutes total for me to do by myself and takes half that if something else is polishing for me.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have fingernails that look like they belong to a construction worker (no offense to scrupulously manicured construction workers...)  mangled, short, and broken.  </li>
            <li> This takes 30 sec for each layer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Money well spent.  </li>
            <li> I used elite 99 polish on my nails, and the dryer cured them in just 30 sec.</li>
            <li> and it turns on when you put your wet nails into the lamp.</li>
            <li> 90 sec - 2 minutes for each layer.  </li>
            <li> The outcome of the drying process does not purely depend on the nail dryer, but also on how you apply your polish as well.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times but compared to the UV lamp I had been using, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Other then that</li>
            <li> It was not the least expensive LED unit available, but I took my cues from others.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and my nails will last for at least 2 weeks sometime longer.</li>
            <li> dark colors like Lincoln Park</li>
            <li> After Dark</li>
            <li> My feet are average width size 7.5</li>
            <li> I applied one coat of base polish, two coats of nail color and one coat of top coat.</li>
            <li> Now if you apply too thick a layer of polish don&#x27;t expect miracles in a 30 second curing time, because your polish will crinkle/wrinke..</li>
            <li> So 4 coats (base, color X2, top coat), and 2 hands &#x3D; 16 minutes of curing time, plus the time it takes to apply all 8 coats.</li>
            <li> I needed to keep expenses down</li>
            <li> so this helps cut down on some of the time.</li>
            <li> So even with doubling the time with the USpicy, I get the job done in half the time.</li>
            <li> The curing time is less than half</li>
            <li> My curing time is way less now.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer for anyone who does not have tine to waste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impatient and figured this product would be mid-line.</li>
            <li> Timer stopped working after a few sessions.</li>
            <li> I purchased the USpicy LED Nail Polish Dryer/Lamp for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> a little&lt;br /&gt;wipe with alcohol on the base of the lamp, and it&#x27;s ready for the next time!</li>
            <li> I may try for shorter times but haven&#x27;t wanted to deal with the disappointment of nail polish rubbing off because I didn&#x27;t cure it long enough.</li>
            <li> and I usually wear polish because I&#x27;m a Nail Technician.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, short nails</li>
            <li> was alittle hard to do 5 fingers though i found it easier to do</li>
            <li> Bought as  a gift for my grown daughter, she has used it at least 4 times already and loves it.</li>
            <li> This really helps as a base coat to bond the polish to my nail.</li>
            <li> For base coats 90sec on each hand &amp; nails were ready for nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I have a professional uv dryer but hate lugging it out just to do one nail.</li>
            <li> I felt really bad that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I always go feeling disappointed in the manicure they did for me.</li>
            <li> I hate the maintence and upkeep of lacquer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PASS ON THIS WORTHLESS PRODUCT!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this machine.  Only 30 seconds for each drying time.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times so far with gelish polish and even after waiting for over 3 minutes under the light they still won&#x27;t dry! So mad at myself for getting rid of the box and even more pissed that I trusted all this products good reviews on Amazon  (something is up with that, unless everyone loves eternally damp gel nail polish). Also tried with OPI gel polish but still no luck drying. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PASS ON THIS WORTHLESS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t take long and nails stay good for 10-14 days depending on what your job is. I wash my hands a lot at work.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer works so great with the gel polishes. I am a teacher and my nails will last for at least 2 weeks sometime longer. They dry with no sheet marks I can pick up my keys and get on the move.</li>
            <li> I recieved my LED lamp within the 2 days shipping as promised. Although I do not find I am getting the fast drying times as others have stated in previous reviews. It took me about 2 minutes per coat, which is the same as the UV lamp I previously used. I use all Harmony gelish products. The motion sensor is a nice feature to  have. If anyone has tips for decreasing the time to cure the gelish polish I would appreciate it. I was dissapointed by how long it took to do a simple manicure with the LED lamp.</li>
            <li> There is nothing about this that I don&#x27;t like. It works flawlessly, the timer is right, the price is right, and it is clean looking and pretty. I am a home user, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for something heavy-duty and professional. This fits the bill perfectly - good quality, attractive, solid, great coverage by the LED lights. I just like everything about it.</li>
            <li> Got two coats in and it shut off and won&#x27;t turn back on. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my USpicy Crescent Led lamp. The last lamp I used only lasted three gelish application and USpicy lamp hasn&#x27;t quit on me yet. I gel my nails almost once a week. :-)</li>
            <li> Amazing produvt  works great and is a very strong item. I Would recommend to anyone trying to do gel nails</li>
            <li> A good lamp. I use with Red Carpet Manicure products. 30 seconds per layer is long enough for this brand.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome investment if you are trying to save time and money by doing your nails at home!  I ordered the white lamp (I love that you can choose your color) and I used it for the first time with my OPI Gel Color polishes and it cured them perfectly!  I love the motion sensor that turns on when you stick your hand in and I LOVE that I can cure one hand at a time!  I was using a much smaller lamp before (RCM Pro) and I&#x27;m pretty sure this cures my nails in half the time!  I like the different timer settings and that the controls are on top of the lamp.  It arrived on time and was packaged well.  It is on the larger side and the cord is rather short, so I had to use an extension cord to do my nails at my kitchen table.  I wish I had purchased this a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I love it!  I have very thin, short nails and I usually wear polish because I&#x27;m a Nail Technician. This really helps as a base coat to bond the polish to my nail.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Was exactly what I was looking for in a gel nail dryer.  Paid for it self.  As good as I got from the nail salon.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s big enough that if you want to do your toe nails you can. I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success. I&#x27;ve had good adherence and no chipping. The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far but I absolutely love it!! I like that it has a sensor to turn on automatically. That made doing a gel pedicure so much easier. I set the light on the ground and just slipped my foot in. It has a very large opening so there is less of a chance of bumping your mani/pedi before you cure it. There is a beep, but it isn&#x27;t that loud and it&#x27;s just a single beep. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid gel uv light!!</li>
            <li> The actual LED Nail Polish dryer is built well and works great. The problem is the digital countdown timer. The display elements do not work properly so you have no idea how much time you&#x27;re setting it for or time remaining. Have not contacted the seller yet to see how customer service is, will let you know.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how big it was.  It is very convenient and I have used it&lt;br /&gt;three times and love it.  So far it is working great.</li>
            <li> This works great! Very happy with results</li>
            <li> Love it. Gel polish dries in 30 seconds! Love the preset timer</li>
            <li> Again as in my other review this light is great! I ordered a second one to provide better more comfortable , faster service in my salon.  Cures Gelish, OPI, and many others, simply follow product recommendation for times.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this LED lamp sooner!! It&#x27;s so fast. It&#x27;s light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great! Fast drying I do 30 second coats and a 60  second base coat just to be safe. Love the automatic start when you put your hand in the unit. Big enough to fit both my feet at the same time great cresent shape for your whole hand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would care so much about having a timer or motion sensor but both things are very convenient and the dryer works well.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this nail dryer. It dries gels fast. Make sure when your buying polish that it is LED compatible. It will not work for UV polishes/ gels.</li>
            <li> Has not held up as far as the interior.</li>
            <li> Okay. I got this product from my boyfriend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. He gave me this for some reason and anyway I liked it. I still use this product and it works perfectly good!!!! If you hesitate to get this item, please buy this!!! I know it is little bit expensive, but you will love it!</li>
            <li> The USpicy Crescent USND-1801 Nail Polish Dryer arrived well packaged. Inside the box was an attractive pink box holding the nail polish dryer, well packaged between sponge layers. The nail polish dryer was easy to remove from the box, and it is quite attractive. There is an information/direction guide and a very useful emory board/nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the nail polish dryer, I read all of the information and directions. I plugged the nail polish dryer in and turned it on. I then went on to finish my manicure. I filed my nails and discovered this nail file is excellent. I applied one coat of base polish, two coats of nail color and one coat of top coat. I turned the switch on, and then the timer selection to 90 seconds. I inserted my right hand into the curing window. At the end of 90 seconds the polish felt dry. I then put my left hand in the curing window. Within another 90 seconds, I had both sets of nails dry. I try too keep my hands quiet for an hour or so while my nails completely dry, but found that after 15 minutes, my nails felt completely dry. What a convenient nail polish dryer. I usually have a complete manicure monthly, and in the summer I have a pedicure monthly. I will use the nail polish dryer on my toes and see how this goes. Very pleased with this. I was given this product to use and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-17-14</li>
            <li> I liked the machine, just not sure how well it keeps it so dry and not pealing off in 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I have a uv Lamp and it takes 1-2 minutes to cure my gel polish so I decided to go with an led lamp which takes 30 seconds. I ordered this lamp and it is fabulous!! It has a digital timer on it and cures each layer of gel in 30 seconds!! It also comes on automatically when u put your hand or foot in it. And fits your whole hand or foot at once. I highly recommend this product and would order it again if I needed another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my light that takes 3 minutes to set each layer.  This takes 30 sec for each layer but I do about 90 sec after the top layer just to be safe.  The only downside is that this lamp is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Now I can do them at home. Make sure to let the lamp heat up a little bit. My first run I was worried because it was taking so long to cure the polish. But once the lamp was on for a little bit it worked great!</li>
            <li> She still raves about this product and calls it the best gift she received all last year! Better than jewelry.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged well. Bought as  a gift for my grown daughter, she has used it at least 4 times already and loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this LED Lamp, it cures gel nail polish quickly and all ten fingers can fit in to it at the same time.  I especially like the automatic sensor.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks and I hope it will last for a long time.  Money well spent.  Thank you seller!</li>
            <li> this thing is LEGIT. Works great - just like a salon.  Love it.  Really sets the gel well. I have no complaints and have been using it for about 4 months now.</li>
            <li> Great buy, works great. I have no problems with my unit what so ever. To my surprise, it has a sensor inside the lamp that automatically turns on the bulbs when you place your hand inside. Nice feature. There is the manual option as well. Cures each gel polish layer application in 30 seconds. Now if you apply too thick a layer of polish don&#x27;t expect miracles in a 30 second curing time, because your polish will crinkle/wrinke..and that&#x27;s with any unit.. LED or UV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first unit ordered from this seller came and appeared to be used or so. So I called Amazon and they honored a rapid return/credit to my account so that I could purchased a replacement. Replacement came perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! It works perfect with uv gel nail polish. It only takes 30 sec. to dry. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Your nails are done in 60 seconds!! Wonderful motion sensor. Incredible fast! Like it! Recomendable for fast and quit jobs.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this so often on her nails, her sisters, her mothers, friends, family&#x27;s. Does the job well. period. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It has paid for itself.  I actually do my nails every week because i want to try different colors!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this with gelish, and it works like a charm, really took time off my manicure. i would definalty recommend this to anyone using a led curing polish</li>
            <li> This machine works great with the gel polishes.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pretty large for a nail polish dryer.  I found it takes up a lot of room.  If finding a space for it isn&#x27;t an issue then it&#x27;s well worth the money.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dryer.I used elite 99 polish on my nails, and the dryer cured them in just 30 sec. It only took me 30 min to paint my nails. I never have to visit the salon again.</li>
            <li> I love this nail lamp!  30 seconds each coat and I am done, doing my own nails has never been easier.  You can tell this is a well made lamp that will last for many years.  I am so glad I spend a little extra and purchased real quality.  Stop looking and buy this lamp, you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I received the USpicy quickly and am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> All I can say about this LED Gel nail light is I LOOOVE IT!!!! In about the 3 times you go to the salon to get a gel manicure you can invest your money and buy one of these all the other supplies and do YOUR nails YOUR way in YOUR own HOME. You can even do pedicures as well. I love it. My nails look fantastic. The machine is soooo easy to use automatic on and off when you put your hand in multi time setting and the machine is sooo DARN CUTE. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is tired of paying high prices and the salon. I always go feeling disappointed in the manicure they did for me. Now I can do it how I like it.</li>
            <li> Read many positive reviews on the USpicy Crescent LED Nail Dryer and decided to give at home gel manicures a try. My first attempt was a great success - two weeks with the gel and my nails look great. And the dryer worked exactly like the salon dryer my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; nail technician used. Old because I can now do this myself and save money.</li>
            <li> Just received my lamp and I love it!!! A little pricey but you definately get what you pay for! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the lamp for a couple of months and works great.  If using a dark color make sure to leave under the lights a little longer.  Love that its led so it doesn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it works with both UV and LED polish systems.  You can set it to stay turned on for different amounts of time, it turns on automatically when you insert your hand, and there is a countdown timer that shows the seconds remaining.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the USpicy, I had purchased the Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp from Amazon. Not bad - it worked just fine, but I wanted to reduce the risk of UV-related skin damage (I wished I had known about LED machines first - but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they existed until after this purchase), so I decided to purchase an LED machine.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Salon Edge UV machine takes about 2 minutes (if I remember correctly) to cure one coat of gel polish (this is what the timer is set to). So 4 coats (base, color X2, top coat), and 2 hands &#x3D; 16 minutes of curing time, plus the time it takes to apply all 8 coats. This certainly isn&#x27;t a lot of time in general (about an hour all together I think), but when I learned how much faster the LED machines are, it was a big plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read the reviews, and decided on the USpicy.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times - it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s super fast, and it works fine! The timer is set for 30 seconds to cure each coat - although I double that time (I don&#x27;t know if doubling the time makes a difference in how thoroughly it cures...I guess I should test to see whether or not it makes a difference). So even with doubling the time with the USpicy, I get the job done in half the time. Plus less potential skin damage (theoretically).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great lamp. Cures evenly and quickly. Love the sensor on feature...very convenient.</li>
            <li> Perfect for do it yourself gel manicures.</li>
            <li> Great product was exactly as described and performed like a charm</li>
            <li> this is such a great LED light!  I would buy it again and again.  I have recommended it to all my friends too.</li>
            <li> Came in nicely packages, worked nicely right away  registered on line for the extended warranty. I do nails at a resort so this will cut down my time for nails significantly.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it takes a bit long to cure the nail.  It takes me about 90+ seconds to cure my nails, and was hoping for it to be quicker.  The their benefit, however, I am not a professional and am not 100% positive I am applying the gel polish correctly.  You must make sure you do not get any polish outside of the nail bed, otherwise it will simply peel off.  I do not think this is a problem with the lamp, just user error.  When I am very careful and keep the polish from going on my cuticles or skin, it gets a great seal and lasts a long time.  The other nice thing about this lamp is that it is large enough to stick your entire hand or foot in at one time.</li>
            <li> I especially love that it has a motion sensor, so the 30 second timer starts and it turns on when you put your wet nails into the lamp. Works great on Gelish polish.</li>
            <li> For base coats 90sec on each hand &amp; nails were ready for nail polish.  Used the 90sec timer for each coat of polish -I put on 2 coats.  I was able to wash dishes &amp; do laundry right after bacause my nails were super dry.  I would recommend this dryer for anyone who does not have tine to waste.  My nails looked like I had them done in a salon.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times but compared to the UV lamp I had been using, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  The curing time is less than half and I believe the polish is staying on even better than before.  If it holds up to it&#x27;s advertising about how long it will work, I&#x27;ll be a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I was spending a fortune at the nail salon every 3 weeks or so getting my nails done. This lamp has saved me a lot of money, and I&#x27;m enjoying having control over my nails again. It does seem to be a true LED, I usually cure for two 30-second sessions for each coat. I use one hand at a time, but you could do two if you squeeze. Haven&#x27;t tried it with my toes yet. Great bargain and it works great (I&#x27;ve had it about 7-8 weeks now).</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Love that it automatically turns on when I insert my hand.</li>
            <li> The light inside still work but the timer is dead, also the product feel very cheap and light.&lt;br /&gt;However the does it job and cure the gel polish well.</li>
            <li> It worked good however after my last light died i decided it would be better if i just bit the bullet and spent alittle extra money for name brand  however this light worked great... was alittle hard to do 5 fingers though i found it easier to do just 4 and thumb separate</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much faster the LED light was.  I am very satisfied with purchase.  It is a small unit which is great for me because I use the unit at home and it fits in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Researched and choose this model for the 18 watts. I&#x27;m impatient and figured this product would be mid-line. Works great! I&#x27;ve found that 90 &amp; 120 seconds cures Gelish product nicely. It&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Lamp works great. I have used it 3 times now, and my nails last about two weeks. Love that! It came on time and as advertised. Just don&#x27;t forget to wipe your nails with rubbing alcohol after the last coat. That will take away that tacky residue.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product!  I like the size and the automatic feature when doing my nails.  I spent a lot of time researching products and reviews and am very happy with the person I bought this from and the service I received.</li>
            <li> Good product. The time display does show the numbers completely sometimes. That is not an important feature for me, so I did not return it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything positive about the Uspicy LED lamp. Paid sixty nine bucks. Literally just unpacked it, plugged it in, and it didn&#x27;t work. When I first turned on, it was to constant on setting. Went I realized it, I switched to timed use. The digital display was flashing 30. I tried to set to 60 seconds and it did nothing. Stuck my hand in and it beeped repeatedly, but no lights came on. But the start button, it beeped but no lights came on. I turned switch back to constant on and the lights did not come on at all. I unplugged and plugged it back in and still got the same thing. Tried plugging it into another outlet and same thing -no lights. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I read so many great reviews but got a lemon. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this nail drier. My Gelish polish takes maybe 30 minutes total for me to do by myself and takes half that if something else is polishing for me. It is big enough for my feet so I&#x27;ve even done my toes Gelish. LOVE THIS DRIER. READ the directions because it confused me at first. The back switch flips both up and down and you&#x27;ll get the timer only on one way.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the better ones on the market.  You can buy cheaper but this one works and it is uses LEDs for the light which can last a long, long time.  It works very fast. (30 seconds.) and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> O M G...if you are still using the older UV lamps for your gel polish...upgrade to the LED.  This one is PERFECT!!!  It has a 30-60-90 timer.  Yes your nails will set in 30 seconds!  I use 1 minute for darker colors.  Light comes on automatically when you put you hand in.  So nice to not have to touch anything with you wet nails.  Just a great product.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as I had thought. Took about 5 min per hand. 2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat.</li>
            <li> Loooove this lamp! I use it with gelish and China gelaze, nails are dry in seconds!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am super excited to have one of these and have been waiting to take the plunge and purchase an LED curing light. I&#x27;ve been giving myself lacquer manicures on the weekly since the beginning of time. I hate the maintence and upkeep of lacquer. Not to mention, air bubbles and dry time... HEADACHE! In all honestly, I should have done it sooner. This light works perfectly. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I will follow up when I get more comfortable with the polish and the process. I am currently giving the light 4 stars for curing time... I did cure each coat for 90 seconds or more. But that is far from the headache of lacquer and it could be my application.</li>
            <li> Timer stopped working after a few sessions. The lamp still works, but have to do everything manually.</li>
            <li> just used his last night and it was awesome! Had OPI gel colors and worked like a charm. So excited to be able to do my nails myself and save $$$$. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have a UV light and wanted a LED light. I am glad I ordered this light, sets my gel polish faster and better than the UV. ordered the white one, they were sold out so they got hold of me and let me know. ( I bought same model just different color) I would recommend this light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 - 3 months.  It has performed well.  You can fit your whole hand in and I like the count down timer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the additional money upfront, listened to other reviewers and purchased this LED gel nail polish dryer. It was not the least expensive LED unit available, but I took my cues from others. It is lightweight; easy to operate; its auto-on feature is very \\&quot;handy\\&quot;; dries my Gelish more quickly than the UV units; and I&#x27;m not bumping my nails within its well-designed interior. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, which has already recovered my investment. Highly recommend the product, the process and the supplier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a year and a half using Gelish.  I used a 9 watt UV nail dryer until now.  I received the Uspicy unit today and did a manicure and pedicure.  I did 30 seconds for each layer until the &#x27;top it off&#x27; top layer where I did 90 seconds.  It turned out great!  I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hands in.  I used to do 2 minutes per layer with my UV, then 3 minutes for the top layer.  I love the time savings.</li>
            <li> I purchased the USpicy LED Nail Polish Dryer/Lamp for a few reasons. First, the LED dryers in general seemed to seem to have more positive reviews as opposed to the UV type of dryers. Secondly, this particular dryer, even though it was more expensive, was a current model (looked like it had recently been released). Third, it was the only dryer that I saw that had a count down timer. I&#x27;ve used this dryer one time &amp; I&#x27;m still wearing the same polish (it&#x27;s been one week &amp; so far so good).  An added bonus was that when I put my hand into the dryer, the lights automatically turned on. It was very easy to use.  I figure that after using this dryer 3 times, it will have paid for itself instead of going to a salon &amp; spending $40 plus a tip. I would highly recommend purchasing this item.  Also note, I&#x27;m a do-it-yourself nail person, not a professional nail technician.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast! Awesome light! Must try!:)</li>
            <li> Seriously, when I only have a couple gel nails to repair, I use the 100w LED light bulb I bought from my nearest store, plug it into any household lamp, and just hold my nail next to the lit bulb for a minute until the gel dries. It works every time, and you save a ton of money. I have a professional uv dryer but hate lugging it out just to do one nail. Wish I had thought of that method sooner.</li>
            <li> Returned it because I didn&#x27;t like the shape, design, and longer dry times. It&#x27;s a bit larger in person than the photo seems. Much of the side area is not used for curing so it seems cumbersome - as other reviews have mentioned. No comment on quality. Went with Gelish version and pleased with its size.</li>
            <li> I received a different product than what was shown. The box looked different and nowhere did it say it was from the brand U-Spicy. Also, this does not cure CND Shellac nail polish. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Works just like the professional salon!</li>
            <li> I used to go a friend of mine who had a nail dryer to get my nails done. After 2 month of use, I finally decided to get one for myself to save me traveling and start my own manicures at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived after only 2 days of purchase. The package is well protected and arrived in good condition. The actual nail dryer is bigger than it looked in the pictures, it can fit my two hands at the same time. The built quality is good. I like the pink color and the layer of glossy paint on the outside, which made the nail dryer look professional. This particular model had a timer, which allows you to choose between 30, 60 and 90 seconds. I always go for the 90 seconds because I use moderate amount of polish so it takes longer to dry out. The machine also automatically starts to count down when you put your hands into it, so it helps to keep track of how much time your hands spent in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used my friend&#x27;s nail dryer before, and I brought the same brand. So I know how to get the most out of these dryers. But if you never used any yourself, internet is the best place to go. The outcome of the drying process does not purely depend on the nail dryer, but also on how you apply your polish as well. So make sure you know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this model is working perfect, even for the higher price I paid. The drying is fast and I don&#x27;t need any gloves since it is not a UV light. Great work from Uspicy, totally worth my 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This led lamp works great!  I switched over from a uv lamp.  My curing time is way less now.  I wish I would have had this lamp from the beginning.  The light turns on when you stick your hand in.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I wanted an led light I could fit my whole hand into this is amazing and works great</li>
            <li> I needed to keep expenses down so I purchased this unit. I didn&#x27;t realize that the bottom doesn&#x27;t remove for feet otherwise I may not have purchased it. But if you carefully insert the toes, it&#x27;s fine. So far it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
            <li> I love the style of this product. The automatic timer and hand sensor are very convenient features. Definitely recommend this to others</li>
            <li> it works. i have used the 90 sec setting so far. i did my nails and they lasted for more than 2 weeks. some say the nail polish does not dry. yes i almost had the same reaction then i realized that until one puts the final coat the nails wont be completely dry. i now think that the top coat is the most important one and I wonder if any nail polish would work as long as the top coat is applied; well I don&#x27;t know, I havent tested that yet; if I do, I might come back and update my review. so apply a lot of the top coat especially on the top of the nail all the way to the edges, as this helps ensure the polish does not peel off (it seals it). thank you very much to the ones who said that any 70% alcohol will do to remove any excess in the end; yes very true and you saved me some money! i like that this machine has the automated start with the sensor. I recommend you keep the packaging for storage as the bulbs seem fragile. Bought for about $135</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product at a great price</li>
            <li> This is a well built lamp.  The entire ceiling is lined with around 100 led lights for even coverage. The leds do emit uv light so they can cure a wide variety of polishes.  No lights on the sides but everything has a mirrored surface. Digital timer and sensor works well.  there is a switch on the back that would run the lamp without the timer.  The size and shape fits hands and feet perfectly.  I bought it to use with cnd shellac and with most colors it did harden the polish onto my nails.  It looked just as nice as the salon.  I returned it because some colors didnt cure as well.  They flaked off faster.  when I did more research i found that shellac will look and feel cured at only 55% done.  so this lamp may be curing it all the way, or it may not.  I could be over or under curing it.  Without a lab test you can&#x27;t know for sure.  Certain polymers only react to certain wavelengths and few companies post that info.  Un-cured chemicals could potentially leech into your nail bed and over time turn into an allergy to shellac.  After spending so much on quality shellac colors, I don&#x27;t want to chance it.  When cured correctly they are hypoallergenic.  I will shell out the additional $70 and get a cND lamp.</li>
            <li> Works well and it big enough for your toes too!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the NOVA one  ($199) and it took forever to cure so I exchanged it with this USpicy about 7 months  ago  (when it cost about $160 then).  It cured my nails faster than the NOVA one, which is no longer on the site) but still took a long time:  90 sec - 2 minutes for each layer.  I tried to do only 30 seconds and it will be soft and peeled off in a few days.  I  used a large UV lamp before, it took 2 minutes to 3 minutes for each coat so there&#x27;s still a slight improvement in terms of  time for this LED light when I put two hands in at the same time.  (need to put one hand on top of the other).  I am wondering whether I did something wrong as most of the reviewers  said it only took 20 seconds -30 seconds for each layer.  In addition, I read that the LED light is still UV light but I cannot give up the gel nail for the shining look and for the no-chipping, etc.  I just hope that I can learn how to make it 30 sec for each layer  -- which will be awesome.</li>
            <li> Works well when I do my gelish nails.</li>
            <li> I was happy withit and came at a timely fashion....but when I went&lt;br /&gt;to use it for the fist time, it wouldn&#x27;t dry my nails.  I felt really bad that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy!  Extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> So far, the LED lamp works very well. It is spacious, I can fit my whole hand underneath the dryer/lights comfortably. I use the&lt;br /&gt;Gelish products for gel nail polish and it takes no time at all to cure the gel. Cleaning it is a breeze, a little&lt;br /&gt;wipe with alcohol on the base of the lamp, and it&#x27;s ready for the next time!</li>
            <li> i purchased this item after trying several other products that were similar and im very happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;it is simple to use and i love the auto timer feature&lt;br /&gt;cures soak off gel polish and has saved me a ton of money from going to the salon for them to do my nails&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend this product if youre one looking to use the soak off gel polish</li>
            <li> I got this to achieve girly hands.  Normally, I have fingernails that look like they belong to a construction worker (no offense to scrupulously manicured construction workers...)  mangled, short, and broken.  I work with my hands all day myself (not in construction) and decided to girl it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Looked into gel nails once before at a salon, but they ruined my nail beds with their drill doodad.&lt;br /&gt;I decided I could paint my own.  Go this machine and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  Works (thus far) like a champ.  And my nails rock.</li>
            <li> This light is fantastic.  It works as well as more expensive models. I love its shape as well.  All of your nails can easily fit inside for a perfect finish.  Thanks USpicy.</li>
            <li> Nail dryer works as it states.  Dries much better than uv lamps.  Have both love the led lamp.  Seems that the nail polish seals better for a longer stay.</li>
            <li> I use Gelish &amp; a few other brands and it works ok.  I would recommend curing thumbs by themselves!  Other then that no problems!</li>
            <li> I use this lamp for OPI Gelcolor and have been satisfied with my purchase thus far (~2 mo. with weekly use). I&#x27;ll list the pros and cons as I see them.&lt;br /&gt;Cons first so I can end on a positive note:&lt;br /&gt;-Works fast but does not work as fast as the $300+ OPI lamp but this is coming from someone who hasn’t used an OPI lamp. I’m going by what OPI says are the cure times for their lamp. For the price I&#x27;d say it works pretty well. I listed the times that have worked for me so far. I may try for shorter times but haven&#x27;t wanted to deal with the disappointment of nail polish rubbing off because I didn&#x27;t cure it long enough. I have noticed that if I don’t cure them long enough the color at the edge of the nail will rub off or the top coat won’t come out as shiny so I’ll have to reapply it.  I’m not a pro at this so it might be user error but I do follow the official OPI instructions to the best of my ability (nail bed prep, thin coats etc.)&lt;br /&gt;base coat- 1 90s cycle&lt;br /&gt;2 color coats – 2 90s cycles for each coat&lt;br /&gt;top coat – 2 90s cycles&lt;br /&gt;For dark colors like Lincoln Park After Dark I add an extra 90s cycle to each of the color coats and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;-It beeps at you when you stick your hand in there or when you change the timer. It’s kind of annoying and not necessary at all. It might make sense if it beeped at you to let you know when the cycle is over but it doesn’t.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It is a tight fit but I can squeeze two hands or two feet in the lamp at the same time so this helps cut down on some of the time. My feet are average width size 7.5 and I’d say I have average size hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;-I really like the countdown timer. You know how much time is left and you don’t have to be distracted with keeping track.&lt;br /&gt;-It automatically turns on when you stick your hand or foot in there. I didn’t think this was that big of a deal when I bought it but when you are trying to multitask this is a really nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. I’m not a pro but I do like being able to do my own nails. I bought this lamp as an investment of sorts. I figured I would recoup the money in not having to go to a nail salon and so far I’ve been happy with this purchase.there you have it. I’m not a pro but I do like being able to do my own nails.

            <li> This led light works great. My favorite feature is when the switch is on and you put your hands under the light it automatically goes on. It&#x27;s also big enough to fit almost your two hands and your toes too.</li>
