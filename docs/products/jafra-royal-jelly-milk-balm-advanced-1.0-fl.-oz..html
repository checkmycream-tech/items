            <li>A great product that has been in production since the 70&#x27;s and still going strong.</li>

            <li>I am thrilled to be able to get this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li>I love Royal Jelly Milk Balm.  </li>
            <li>Also love their time protector daytime moisturizer SPF 15 for daytime.</li>
            <li>I am very proud to say I only speak and read English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best facial lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this for my face and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have SPF protection, but so many foundations and powders do, so that doesn&#x27;t concern me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE JELLY MILK BALM...</li>
            <li>Of course we are all looking for magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any strong perfumy scent and makes my skin glow and appear more youthful, and has improved my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for nearly 40 years and still love it since the first time I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>I was looking to purchase the original Royal Jelly that Jafra sold many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light,</li>
            <li>Product is genuine and true to size</li>
            <li>The original is more yellow in color and has a nice, smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Not magic but works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>like Sephora opened where I could get access to other great moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Every other day I used this one it feel good</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price is half cost what&#x27;s better</li>
            <li>I like simple routines and use RJMB all over face,neck, top of hands.</li>
            <li>first...</li>
            <li>I love that the seller packed it carefully and shipped it quickly.</li>
            <li>I could see a huge difference as soon as the next morning.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves jafra and orders it all the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, silky, it absorbs, and in one application, my skin perked back up!  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it....</li>
            <li>This product is very beneficial for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Jaffa what&#x27;s not to live.</li>
            <li>What I got was something very near drugstore quality.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and never had a problem with their products.</li>
            <li>i have used this product since i was 30 years old</li>
            <li>and i have been told that i look as if i am in my early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>like having the soft feeling skin after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same product that they sell from the actual web sight.</li>
            <li>I actually usually buy directly from Jafra, and the cost for the Royal jelly is around $75.00 it works wonders, it clean my face from acne scars.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin this would work, if you have dry or very dry forget it because this has firming stuff in it that zaps the moisture right out of your skin.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Jafra&#x27;s Royal Jelly Milk Balm, and it was the only thing that relieved my raw and damaged skin and helped it heal very fast.  </li>

            <li> In the past 10 years, I have tried virtually everything on the market for daily moisturizer, but this remains to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you have oily skin this would work, if you have dry or very dry forget it because this has firming stuff in it that zaps the moisture right out of your skin. Also contains vitamin e, if you are allergic, do not use.</li>
            <li> I have an older bottle of this milk balm royal jelly, this is like the only moisturizer ive tried that does not cause little bumps on my forehead. high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price is half cost what&#x27;s better</li>
            <li> I love Royal Jelly Milk Balm.  I was introduced to it many years ago when my cousin began selling Jafra products, and I had a bad case of sun poisoining on my nose and cheeks. My skin was raw and sore and everything I put on it burned.  Then I tried Jafra&#x27;s Royal Jelly Milk Balm, and it was the only thing that relieved my raw and damaged skin and helped it heal very fast.  I could see a huge difference as soon as the next morning.  I continued using this product for years, but then my cousin stopped selling the products and stores like Sephora opened where I could get access to other great moisturizers.  But nothing has worked as well as this milk balm.  Now that I found it online, I am really happy to have an easy and convenient way to obtain this product.  It goes on light, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any strong perfumy scent and makes my skin glow and appear more youthful, and has improved my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for nearly 40 years and still love it since the first time I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product you should.  Jafra Royal Milk Jelly Balm really is a great moisturizer for any skin type, and the price was fantastic.  I love that the seller packed it carefully and shipped it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!!</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT COME WITH THE PUMP THAT GOS WITH IT. IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using jafra for years for skin care,,not makeup. I have sensitive skin and never had a problem with their products. Anytime I tried other face product lines, after a few weeks I&#x27;d get bumps under the skin or breakouts. So, enough of that! Staying with Jafra. I like simple routines and use RJMB all over face,neck, top of hands. Also love their time protector daytime moisturizer SPF 15 for daytime. I get lots of compliments on my skin. At 60!</li>
            <li> Love jaffra and love that I get a great deal. Product is genuine and true to size</li>
            <li> first...Why did you send me the book that was in SPANISH??????  DO NOT speak nor read SPANISH,YOU CANNOT ASSUME EVERYONE READS OR SPEAKS it.  I am very proud to say I only speak and read English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second...Have not seen a change in my skin yet...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She absolutely loves jafra and orders it all the time. It is the exact same product that they sell from the actual web sight.</li>
            <li> Every other day I used this one it feel good just some times it feel like burn sensation around my chicks</li>
            <li> I have been using Royal Jelly by Jafra since the only way you could get it was to have a house pastry. I am almost 62 and am often mistaken for the mother of my grandkids. I am getting my 1st wrinkles now and my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li> i have used this product since i was 30 years old and i am now 75 and i have been told that i look as if i am in my early 60&#x27;s. i guess that says it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled to be able to buy this without having to have a home party.  It&#x27;s the best facial lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Jafra Royal Jelly rocks</li>
            <li> Love this for my face and have been using it for years. It just seems to help with all kinds of problems that may occur.&lt;br /&gt;I like having the soft feeling skin after applying it to my face. This does not leave a oily residue on the skin. A great product that has been in production since the 70&#x27;s and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to be able to get this on Amazon.  I used it for years until I didn&#x27;t have an independent rep in my area.  In the past 10 years, I have tried virtually everything on the market for daily moisturizer, but this remains to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have SPF protection, but so many foundations and powders do, so that doesn&#x27;t concern me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, silky, it absorbs, and in one application, my skin perked back up!  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer around!</li>
            <li> I was looking to purchase the original Royal Jelly that Jafra sold many years ago.  This does not fit the bill.  The original is more yellow in color and has a nice, smooth texture.  What I got was something very near drugstore quality.  I really don&#x27;t like it....sorry!</li>
            <li> I actually usually buy directly from Jafra, and the cost for the Royal jelly is around $75.00 it works wonders, it clean my face from acne scars. But this one leaves lotion residues and does not do anything to my skin, sorry but don&#x27;t think this is the original.</li>
            <li> I USE THI CREAM BEFORE  AND FOR SAME REASON I SWITCH FOR ANOTHER CREAM AND DEFINITELY I MADE A MISTAKE...I LOVE JELLY MILK BALM...</li>
            <li> Common it&#x27;s Jaffa what&#x27;s not to live. Of course we are all looking for magic in a bottle. Not magic but works wonderfully! I miss this when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> This product is very beneficial for my skin.  I use it in the mornings as a foundation for the other moisturizers that I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  It was as promised and I received it sooner than I expected.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I used a product that gave me a chemical burn. I used my royal jelly. Healed the burn within 3 days, no scar at all. Keeps my skin soft.i am in love with this! If you order from jafra and don&#x27;t like it (which how could you not?) they will give you a credit for something else.</li>
