            <li>I&#x27;d easily compare it to brushes that cost $50</li>
            <li>However there is a strong smell.</li>
            <li>did get the strong glue (or</li>
            <li>Omg hands down best brush ever!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it does it job just fine</li>
            <li>Super for contouring!  </li>
            <li>For less than 10 bucks I  got a good brush and cleaning  glove which I think  is a good  deal.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell, but after a light wash it is fine.</li>
            <li>The little brush cleaning tool is awesome!</li>
            <li>sure to wash this brush first though!</li>
            <li>I used the brush and it works well for stippling the contour product precisely where you want it.</li>
            <li>I also received a free brush cleaning item.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to lightly stamp on the color and blend it upwards</li>
            <li>Now as for the brush cleaning free gift.</li>
            <li>It does a really good job contouring the face; the bristles are really soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how good it did its job.</li>

            <li>Dense, soft and seems to be good quality.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>Applies product beautifully and easily, and also seems extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li>The price is beyond reasonable and the delivery is right on point!!!</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and is very precise for my ladies who love a sharp contour.</li>
            <li>good quality, super soft, brush is full and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great contouring brush and definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Top of the line quality, the E2shop brush is a high-grade synthetic makeup brush therefore; it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So soft and such a wonderful brush!</li>
            <li>A perfectly clean brush.  </li>
            <li>I was so exited to find this brush at such a cheap price and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap!</li>
            <li>it was nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush!!</li>
            <li>I was contemplating between this and a MAC flat contouring brush as MAC always has great brushes but a bit pricey for my budget right now.</li>
            <li>this brush is amazing, super dense and soft!</li>
            <li>After seeing the price, I thought it was probably going to be a piece of junk, but I wanted to try out this particular shape of brush as compared to a couple of others being that I am new to contouring and trying to figure out what works best for me as far as brush shapes.  </li>
            <li>It is very densely packed, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like a lot of cheap brushes, and BONUS!  </li>
            <li>..blends very well :)  </li>
            <li>and the price is just good enough.</li>
            <li>Definitely not just for girls :P this brush is simply the best I&#x27;ve tried for contouring, and as someone who has contoured daily for years trust me, this is glorious.</li>
            <li>, you can just blend it away (with the same brush or another one that is good for blending).  </li>
            <li>Omg this brush is amazing its so sturdy and the hairs are super soft.</li>
            <li>The included gift that helps clean make up brushes is stellar, as well!</li>
            <li>came just fine no weird chemical odor...</li>
            <li>But the item did come quick and does look like the image.</li>
            <li>It comes with a really helpful Makeup Brush Cleaning Tool you can use for most of your brushes (inset picture), and I find that the smaller the brush, the better the job it does…but it does do a great job on this Flat Contour Brush!  </li>
            <li>I love this flat contour brush ive seen many of the name brand ones</li>
            <li>This seemed to be one of the narrower brushes, so I figured it might fit below my cheekbones pretty well without getting contour powder in the blush area.</li>
            <li>love this brush.. very very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is an exact dupe for the Nars Ita brush!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this brush for anyone who loves their contouring!!</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality for the little price I paid.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush, rather large (which is what I wanted), very dense soft brush hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing combination.</li>
            <li>The brush hair are very dense and smooth.</li>
            <li>This brush is useful for both cream products and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, this brush is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love this thing to death, and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>i rarely use it.</li>
            <li>If it was cheaper (up to $3),  I would think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I just got this brush today, so I will update this if anything changes, but so far, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love the control that this one gives me and how soft it feels.</li>
            <li>I have not actually laid eyes on the nars brush but honestly I don&#x27;t even care anymore.</li>
            <li>; brush cleaner is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The brush is kind of big.</li>
            <li>Too condense for countering but good for other things.</li>
            <li>Right out of the packaging, I didn&#x27;t notice any chemical smells that others have reported.</li>
            <li>It places my contour powder right were I need it.</li>
            <li>Like it a lot, great quality not only for the price but in general.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was because I wanted the free gift.</li>
            <li>Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, sturdy strong handle...</li>
            <li>the brush is very soft and is blends very well :)</li>
            <li>This is also for contouring along the jawline, which will give the face a little more definition and a more defined jawline.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>After a nice washing and leaving it out to dry on my Benjabelle brush tree, the smell was gone.</li>
            <li>It cleaned all my brushes, super fast, taking off all the makeup.</li>
            <li>New fav!!!</li>
            <li>Even compare to the new Nars ITA brush which is $80!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense so use a light hand at first because it can really stamp on a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I cannot express enough how much I love this brush.</li>
            <li>And I have tried holding the brush in several different ways to see if maybe there is a perfect way, but such is not the case.  </li>
            <li>but I did wash the brush with some soap and hot water</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I bought this one and gave it a try before forking out tons of money on a very similar one.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, to big for my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li>The denseness of the brush allows the product to go exactly where you want.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>except after the first use the front part detached from the handle</li>
            <li>Giant and too dense for a contour brush, smell was potent too.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>night, first thing</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>the anastasia contour kit and the brush is too wide and fat to work nicely with the pans.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>If you want to do that multiple foundation shade contour look (Kim Kardashian made famous)</li>
            <li>I have been in the market for a good quality contour brush for a few months now.</li>
            <li>However, along the jaw in order to blend use gentle downward strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a touch of highlighting, this brush is perfect for both, a little highlighting above the cheekbone and down along the top of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but most women w dry skin know if u use the brushes to much in the wrong direction it make our skin scaley so much for ur perfect makeup but is ur gentle and take ur time</li>
            <li>so cleaning the brush will be easy, especially with the brush egg.</li>
            <li>Super soft  </li>
            <li>but I got it because I thought the small end might fit under my cheekbones better).  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping was moderately fast.</li>
            <li>Works very well with contouring my cheek bones just like my Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>It has dense, high-quality bristles and a wide handle for more control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month now, and it does the job really well.  </li>
            <li>In summary, I do recommend this makeup brush for contouring, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compare to the Mac 163 contour brush, it is easier to place and blend products with this E2shop brush, although it is slightly more wide than the Mac brush.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very dense.</li>
            <li>It was much thicker than I thought it would be, but it applys it very well.</li>
            <li>The brush seems have a lot wax on it, no matter how much I wash it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well.</li>
            <li>Feels  very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Found this much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably as well</li>
            <li>and it seemed to spread the product out too much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but still dense enough to be able to have control of the product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend and it did show up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It picks up adequate amounts of product with little effort and powders that I used didn&#x27;t shake off too easy when I tried to tap the excess off.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product!</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and its actually a bit bigger than I expected but it works great for what I was looking to use it for (contouring on the cheeks)</li>
            <li>I read some reviews about the initial strong scent of glue that hits you in the face when you first open the package, so I was prepared, but I either got lucky or others are really sensitive to the smell of glue.  </li>
            <li>, it is 6 ½”, the bristles are thick, soft, and dense and the circumference of the smooth round wood handle is 2 ½” which gives me a good comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>Super soft, and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed, not one bit.</li>
            <li>The built is awesome and looks very expensive.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still just as soft as the first day</li>
            <li>Not sure what kind of paint was used on the handle</li>
            <li>brushes  cost much more and its not worth it.</li>
            <li>First the hairs on the brush are extremely soft and after I washed it none of the hairs came out</li>
            <li>Would be better if it were just a tad less dense.</li>
            <li>That is mainly why I ordered this item.</li>
            <li>only rating this 4.5/5 because of the funny chemical smell that it had when I first received it.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft, and very dense, and the bristles have uniform precision, there are NO longer or shorter bristle pieces that cheaper brushes sometimes have which leave streaks and blotches.</li>
            <li>known that  high end contour  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I can compare this brush to those highly priced brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little better than the e.l.f contour brush in terms of buffing out the product in an upwards motion.</li>
            <li>this brush is sooooo soft and it really does help w/ my contouring.</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft and very dense.</li>
            <li>The width is too thick to effectively contour and blend</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was surprised that it was so luxuriously soft and so far, seems to be pretty well made.  </li>
            <li>Being new to makeup.</li>
            <li>This brush is a lot better than expected, also a lot bigger and dense.</li>
            <li>Magical, ethereal contour done by little ol&#x27; you!</li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY soft and pick up a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush.</li>
            <li>Soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t shed and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are dense but very soft.</li>
            <li>not  able  to  say  much  more</li>
            <li>All you have to do is sweep back and forth in one straight line, and voila!</li>
            <li>sooo soft!</li>
            <li>So soft and doesnt she&#x27;d!</li>
            <li>shipping came at the early expecting date!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need for my personal and professional makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies directly to where you want it.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and extremely dense.</li>
            <li>SO SOFT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and makes contouring a breeze.</li>
            <li>I use this brush regularly for contouring; it picks up product really well and has no fallout while applying.  </li>
            <li>it is exactly what I was looking for and the delivery didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li>I really want my money back</li>
            <li>It actually works really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;And soft</li>
            <li>It is TOO soft if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>Somewhat dense but soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush is dense and soft so it&#x27;s not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li>The contuor is soft with this brush so it make you look so natural.</li>
            <li>It is dense and soft and applies product like a dream.</li>
            <li>The brush is on the stiffer side but SOFT.</li>
            <li>This brush wreaks of petrochemical odor, these are very cheap bristles, think the kind of fiber in a cheap wig, not to mention that this is 2.25&amp;#34; wide which is ridiculous, i have been a pro make up artist for 40 years and this is laughable,</li>
            <li>It barely picked up any product and just didnt live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li>I got the brush and tried it today I can only say woooooww, I did not need my finger as I use to with my old brush, it blended my cream foundation better than my finger of any other brush I ever used, I gave it a 4 stars just because it still early to know how long it will last and thank you for the cleaning tool it works very well</li>
            <li>definitely compares to the high end ones</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and yet firm enough to control the placement of product.</li>
            <li>The fact that the brush is quite long for the palette, actually works ok for me because the half of the brush without product helps me to blend what I just put on when I go back and forth with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Grey brush high quality.</li>
            <li>The reviews were a big help, It&#x27;s so soft, light,and contours like but</li>
            <li>The window in my bathroom was already open, so the brush simply aired  itself out.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for contouring and it works just as well as my old Nars contour brush that mysteriously vanished from my kit.</li>
            <li>applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a contour application, use the flat end of the brush to draw a line from the hairline across and directly under the cheekbone.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but I thought this brush would be comparable to the shape of the mac 163 flat contour brush, but it isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive brushes!</li>
            <li>I have owned more expensive makeup brushes that have not come close to this quality for a soft and dense synthetic makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The three main uses for the E2shop flat contour brush are for foundation, contour shaping and highlighting, and just the flat end of the brush is necessary for all</li>
            <li>To keep it in the best condition, dry it lying flat after washing…do not stand it up so that water can settle at the base of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>6 1/2&amp;#34; long complete length.</li>
            <li>The brush is super thick with no shedding.</li>
            <li>The wide width means I can apply my foundation in just a few strokes and the flat shape of the bristles prevents makeup from being forced into pores, so my foundation goes on very smoothly!</li>

            <li> This contour brush works better than the one I purchased at Mac &amp; Sephora.</li>
            <li> I am fully confident the smell will go away after I wash the brush.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> Love Love</li>
            <li> is my favorite Contour brush ever.</li>
            <li> This even works better for me than the Tarte Slenderizer brush (which is actually more for cream or pencil contour</li>
            <li> I have the Anastasia powder contour and it worked ok for me with this compact set.  </li>
            <li> I need to play around with it some more to be sure about the rest of the face).</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> it is amazing quality for so cheap.</li>
            <li> I just might keep it under my pillow at night for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> Oh and I almost forgot, the shipping was way faster than what the expected delivery date specified, so win win all around :-)</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleasant of the smell when I first got it</li>
            <li> love it, it came with a brush egg, to clean ur brushes and it works amazing</li>
            <li> So perfect zero complaints and super soft!</li>
            <li> It gets the perfect amount of product and the bristles are super soft!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing and blends very very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as any high brand contour brush; maybe even better.</li>
            <li> The brush was Okey., but I think my sister enjoy using it more</li>
            <li> So soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect - not too wide and not so dense that it hurts.</li>
            <li> I loved it, my sister watched as I cleaned my brushes and now she wants one.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s plush enough to blend everything out perfectly!</li>
            <li> Honestly for the price you need to buy this brush right now.</li>
            <li> Good contour brush and love the brush egg that it comes with- helps clean brushes very well..</li>
            <li> I found a contouring brush that made it for me to easily apply my bronzer.</li>
            <li> Great brush will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> It makes contouring easy.</li>
            <li> Makes contouring so easy</li>
            <li> Blends easily</li>
            <li> Contouring have never been this easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d easily compare it to brushes that cost $50</li>
            <li> However there is a strong smell.</li>
            <li> did get the strong glue (or</li>
            <li> Omg hands down best brush ever!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it does it job just fine</li>
            <li> Super for contouring!  </li>
            <li> For less than 10 bucks I  got a good brush and cleaning  glove which I think  is a good  deal.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell, but after a light wash it is fine.</li>
            <li> The little brush cleaning tool is awesome!</li>
            <li> sure to wash this brush first though!</li>
            <li> I used the brush and it works well for stippling the contour product precisely where you want it.</li>
            <li> I also received a free brush cleaning item.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to lightly stamp on the color and blend it upwards</li>
            <li> Now as for the brush cleaning free gift.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job contouring the face; the bristles are really soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how good it did its job.</li>
            <li> As good or even better than mac&#x27;s brushes, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Dense, soft and seems to be good quality.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Applies product beautifully and easily, and also seems extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> The price is beyond reasonable and the delivery is right on point!!!</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and is very precise for my ladies who love a sharp contour.</li>
            <li> good quality, super soft, brush is full and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great contouring brush and definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Top of the line quality, the E2shop brush is a high-grade synthetic makeup brush therefore; it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So soft and such a wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> A perfectly clean brush.  </li>
            <li> I was so exited to find this brush at such a cheap price and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap!</li>
            <li> it was nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush!!</li>
            <li> I was contemplating between this and a MAC flat contouring brush as MAC always has great brushes but a bit pricey for my budget right now.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing, super dense and soft!</li>
            <li> After seeing the price, I thought it was probably going to be a piece of junk, but I wanted to try out this particular shape of brush as compared to a couple of others being that I am new to contouring and trying to figure out what works best for me as far as brush shapes.  </li>
            <li> It is very densely packed, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like a lot of cheap brushes, and BONUS!  </li>
            <li> ..blends very well :)  </li>
            <li> and the price is just good enough.</li>
            <li> Definitely not just for girls :P this brush is simply the best I&#x27;ve tried for contouring, and as someone who has contoured daily for years trust me, this is glorious.</li>
            <li> , you can just blend it away (with the same brush or another one that is good for blending).  </li>
            <li> Omg this brush is amazing its so sturdy and the hairs are super soft.</li>
            <li> The included gift that helps clean make up brushes is stellar, as well!</li>
            <li> came just fine no weird chemical odor...</li>
            <li> But the item did come quick and does look like the image.</li>
            <li> It comes with a really helpful Makeup Brush Cleaning Tool you can use for most of your brushes (inset picture), and I find that the smaller the brush, the better the job it does…but it does do a great job on this Flat Contour Brush!  </li>
            <li> I love this flat contour brush ive seen many of the name brand ones</li>
            <li> This seemed to be one of the narrower brushes, so I figured it might fit below my cheekbones pretty well without getting contour powder in the blush area.</li>
            <li> love this brush.. very very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is an exact dupe for the Nars Ita brush!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this brush for anyone who loves their contouring!!</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality for the little price I paid.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, rather large (which is what I wanted), very dense soft brush hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing combination.</li>
            <li> The brush hair are very dense and smooth.</li>
            <li> This brush is useful for both cream products and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this thing to death, and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> i rarely use it.</li>
            <li> If it was cheaper (up to $3),  I would think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush today, so I will update this if anything changes, but so far, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the control that this one gives me and how soft it feels.</li>
            <li> I have not actually laid eyes on the nars brush but honestly I don&#x27;t even care anymore.</li>
            <li> ; brush cleaner is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The brush is kind of big.</li>
            <li> Too condense for countering but good for other things.</li>
            <li> Right out of the packaging, I didn&#x27;t notice any chemical smells that others have reported.</li>
            <li> It places my contour powder right were I need it.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, great quality not only for the price but in general.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was because I wanted the free gift.</li>
            <li> Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, sturdy strong handle...</li>
            <li> the brush is very soft and is blends very well :)</li>
            <li> This is also for contouring along the jawline, which will give the face a little more definition and a more defined jawline.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> After a nice washing and leaving it out to dry on my Benjabelle brush tree, the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> It cleaned all my brushes, super fast, taking off all the makeup.</li>
            <li> New fav!!!</li>
            <li> Even compare to the new Nars ITA brush which is $80!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense so use a light hand at first because it can really stamp on a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I cannot express enough how much I love this brush.</li>
            <li> And I have tried holding the brush in several different ways to see if maybe there is a perfect way, but such is not the case.  </li>
            <li> but I did wash the brush with some soap and hot water</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I bought this one and gave it a try before forking out tons of money on a very similar one.</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, to big for my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li> The denseness of the brush allows the product to go exactly where you want.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> except after the first use the front part detached from the handle</li>
            <li> Giant and too dense for a contour brush, smell was potent too.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> night, first thing</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> the anastasia contour kit and the brush is too wide and fat to work nicely with the pans.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> If you want to do that multiple foundation shade contour look (Kim Kardashian made famous)</li>
            <li> I have been in the market for a good quality contour brush for a few months now.</li>
            <li> However, along the jaw in order to blend use gentle downward strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a touch of highlighting, this brush is perfect for both, a little highlighting above the cheekbone and down along the top of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but most women w dry skin know if u use the brushes to much in the wrong direction it make our skin scaley so much for ur perfect makeup but is ur gentle and take ur time</li>
            <li> so cleaning the brush will be easy, especially with the brush egg.</li>
            <li> Super soft  </li>
            <li> but I got it because I thought the small end might fit under my cheekbones better).  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Shipping was moderately fast.</li>
            <li> Works very well with contouring my cheek bones just like my Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> It has dense, high-quality bristles and a wide handle for more control.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month now, and it does the job really well.  </li>
            <li> In summary, I do recommend this makeup brush for contouring, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare to the Mac 163 contour brush, it is easier to place and blend products with this E2shop brush, although it is slightly more wide than the Mac brush.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very dense.</li>
            <li> It was much thicker than I thought it would be, but it applys it very well.</li>
            <li> The brush seems have a lot wax on it, no matter how much I wash it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well.</li>
            <li> Feels  very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Found this much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably as well</li>
            <li> and it seemed to spread the product out too much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but still dense enough to be able to have control of the product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend and it did show up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It picks up adequate amounts of product with little effort and powders that I used didn&#x27;t shake off too easy when I tried to tap the excess off.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product!</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and its actually a bit bigger than I expected but it works great for what I was looking to use it for (contouring on the cheeks)</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the initial strong scent of glue that hits you in the face when you first open the package, so I was prepared, but I either got lucky or others are really sensitive to the smell of glue.  </li>
            <li> , it is 6 ½”, the bristles are thick, soft, and dense and the circumference of the smooth round wood handle is 2 ½” which gives me a good comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> Super soft, and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed, not one bit.</li>
            <li> The built is awesome and looks very expensive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still just as soft as the first day</li>
            <li> Not sure what kind of paint was used on the handle</li>
            <li> brushes  cost much more and its not worth it.</li>
            <li> First the hairs on the brush are extremely soft and after I washed it none of the hairs came out</li>
            <li> Would be better if it were just a tad less dense.</li>
            <li> That is mainly why I ordered this item.</li>
            <li> only rating this 4.5/5 because of the funny chemical smell that it had when I first received it.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft, and very dense, and the bristles have uniform precision, there are NO longer or shorter bristle pieces that cheaper brushes sometimes have which leave streaks and blotches.</li>
            <li> known that  high end contour  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I can compare this brush to those highly priced brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little better than the e.l.f contour brush in terms of buffing out the product in an upwards motion.</li>
            <li> this brush is sooooo soft and it really does help w/ my contouring.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> The width is too thick to effectively contour and blend</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was surprised that it was so luxuriously soft and so far, seems to be pretty well made.  </li>
            <li> Being new to makeup.</li>
            <li> This brush is a lot better than expected, also a lot bigger and dense.</li>
            <li> Magical, ethereal contour done by little ol&#x27; you!</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY soft and pick up a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush.</li>
            <li> Soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t shed and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are dense but very soft.</li>
            <li> not  able  to  say  much  more</li>
            <li> All you have to do is sweep back and forth in one straight line, and voila!</li>
            <li> sooo soft!</li>
            <li> So soft and doesnt she&#x27;d!</li>
            <li> shipping came at the early expecting date!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need for my personal and professional makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies directly to where you want it.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and extremely dense.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and makes contouring a breeze.</li>
            <li> I use this brush regularly for contouring; it picks up product really well and has no fallout while applying.  </li>
            <li> it is exactly what I was looking for and the delivery didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li> I really want my money back</li>
            <li> It actually works really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;And soft</li>
            <li> It is TOO soft if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Somewhat dense but soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush is dense and soft so it&#x27;s not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li> The contuor is soft with this brush so it make you look so natural.</li>
            <li> It is dense and soft and applies product like a dream.</li>
            <li> The brush is on the stiffer side but SOFT.</li>
            <li> This brush wreaks of petrochemical odor, these are very cheap bristles, think the kind of fiber in a cheap wig, not to mention that this is 2.25&amp;#34; wide which is ridiculous, i have been a pro make up artist for 40 years and this is laughable,</li>
            <li> It barely picked up any product and just didnt live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li> I got the brush and tried it today I can only say woooooww, I did not need my finger as I use to with my old brush, it blended my cream foundation better than my finger of any other brush I ever used, I gave it a 4 stars just because it still early to know how long it will last and thank you for the cleaning tool it works very well</li>
            <li> definitely compares to the high end ones</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and yet firm enough to control the placement of product.</li>
            <li> The fact that the brush is quite long for the palette, actually works ok for me because the half of the brush without product helps me to blend what I just put on when I go back and forth with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Grey brush high quality.</li>
            <li> The reviews were a big help, It&#x27;s so soft, light,and contours like but</li>
            <li> The window in my bathroom was already open, so the brush simply aired  itself out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for contouring and it works just as well as my old Nars contour brush that mysteriously vanished from my kit.</li>
            <li> applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a contour application, use the flat end of the brush to draw a line from the hairline across and directly under the cheekbone.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but I thought this brush would be comparable to the shape of the mac 163 flat contour brush, but it isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> I have owned more expensive makeup brushes that have not come close to this quality for a soft and dense synthetic makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The three main uses for the E2shop flat contour brush are for foundation, contour shaping and highlighting, and just the flat end of the brush is necessary for all</li>
            <li> To keep it in the best condition, dry it lying flat after washing…do not stand it up so that water can settle at the base of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> 6 1/2&amp;#34; long complete length.</li>
            <li> The brush is super thick with no shedding.</li>
            <li> The wide width means I can apply my foundation in just a few strokes and the flat shape of the bristles prevents makeup from being forced into pores, so my foundation goes on very smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well the glue holds it together since it&#x27;s brand new, but so far I dig it.</li>
            <li> and I want a sharp contour not a fluffy rectangle brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush seems to pick up the right amount of product so the contour shade isn&#x27;t  too dark or harsh.</li>
            <li> flat and make it work.  </li>
            <li> This brush is flattish and has a wide head, but it isn&#x27;t actually flat enough to do a contour with.</li>
            <li> The only two things I didn&#x27;t like about this brush is that the bristles were a little too long/had a little too much give and the size of the handle.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little soft</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t htink much of that, I lave that little thing too!!  </li>
            <li> It was bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> You will thank me and the other 5 star reviews later</li>
            <li> You can use other brushes you have to do the same thing this does.  </li>
            <li> have used the E2shop flat contour brush for almost a month and a half and during this time I have washed this brush several times and it does not shed any bristles.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice it now (although it&#x27;s not all the way dry yet).</li>
            <li> It is so soft and my contour looks unbelievable</li>
            <li> This will define the cheek and give the cheeks a slight lifted appearance, then gently blend upward using small slight strokes.</li>
            <li> u have to be careful</li>
            <li> The one issue that I do have with this brush and the only reason it lost a star for me is that it is heavy and bulky.  </li>
            <li> then I use a different fluffy powder brush to blend.</li>
            <li> this was what I was expected.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses and another wash, the smell is totally gone now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The synthetic bristles are dense and firm enough for foundations, both liquid and cream.</li>
            <li> Picks up a lot of product so be careful.</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews before purchasing this brush so it was expected.</li>
            <li> Which one should really never do anyways.</li>
            <li> 2&#x27; wide 3/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the brush came a few days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> other brush</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker then expected!</li>
            <li> and I am already about to purchase other brushes from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li> Guess they throw that in due to the smell that knocks you out when you get the brush out of the sealed plastic.</li>
            <li> Holy cow</li>
            <li> Not as small as the MAC brand but serves the same purpose for half the price.</li>
            <li> My hands are small in general, so I&#x27;m not sure that this is legit complaint, but for me, I use a soft application method, so my makeup brushes need to just practically sit on my hands and glide over my skin, but because this brush is a little heavy, it makes it harder for me to use while contouring.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is see as a negative is the size..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too thick for contour need another brush to blend because looks like too much and dusty</li>
            <li> ..wish it was a little less wide in dimensions.</li>
            <li> I typically use it with a powder bronzer</li>
            <li> Got it for less than $5</li>
            <li> It does have a slight paint smell</li>
            <li> I was expecting just a typical brush.</li>
            <li> I just rubbed about half of the brush through the powder and then applied.  </li>
            <li> I have been drooling over the nars contour brush, but as said in previous reviews, I cannot spend $80 on one brush.</li>
            <li> It can pick up as much or as little product as you want.  </li>
            <li> (I have little room to work with).</li>
            <li> also It came with a little brush cleaner.  </li>
            <li> it feels the same the only bad thing i can say if u have dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to create an airbrush look with my Dermablend foundation.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the packaging, it smelled heavily of chemicals and plastic.</li>
            <li> So for the price, I though this was a waste of money and just another brush taking up space.</li>
            <li> It this leaves too harsh of a line for you</li>
            <li> That green 2 1/4&amp;#34; X 3&amp;#34</li>
            <li> you wash the brush on that green thing to get rid of the chemical glue smell.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I felt it was too fluffy</li>
            <li> , it felt stiff and didn&#x27;t move with ease on my face.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this brush but figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it was a bust.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little scrubbing pad!  </li>
            <li> I have a very small face structure, so it&#x27;s hard to even find a blush brush that isn&#x27;t too wide for my face.</li>
            <li> Im not one to buy high end brushes but this one feels like its very expensive</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people are saying it smells like paint</li>
            <li> Received it in a few days from ordering!</li>
            <li> Also when I apply my powder bronzer you can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing a powder bronzer</li>
            <li> It seemed to be on the bristles -not just the handle or ferrule, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> least for the cheeks and around the jaw (probably all</li>
            <li> I like it, but the base holder is too thick and it does not pick up the product very evenly.</li>
            <li> thick.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> I find it too thick!</li>
            <li> Handle is very thick</li>
            <li> This has become my secret weapon in the war of contouring.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous !</li>
            <li> Seriously i would pay 20$ for this !</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy this brush!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but it had a terrible chemical paint smell that I couldn&#x27;t get over.</li>
            <li> brush had  a weird smell like paint  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Has a slimey dirty feeling too it.</li>
            <li> i dont know why people are saying that it has a bad odor to it mine</li>
            <li> NOT A MAKE UP ONE...:(</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nars ita brush and was so disappointed I returned it.  </li>
            <li> But boy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The brush broke before I even used it, and they didn&#x27;t even send me the brush cleaner and the brush had a awful smell</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t what you see in the picture and the brush feels disgusting.</li>

            <li> The brush broke before I even used it, and they didn&#x27;t even send me the brush cleaner and the brush had a awful smell</li>
            <li> I love this flat contour brush ive seen many of the name brand ones it feels the same the only bad thing i can say if u have dry skin u have to be careful but most women w dry skin know if u use the brushes to much in the wrong direction it make our skin scaley so much for ur perfect makeup but is ur gentle and take ur time it works wonderful</li>
            <li> Best brush ever for the price. Horse hair feels so wonderful.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush.. finally I found a perfect contour brush, easily affordable. Before I only saw the Nars contouring brush.. no way am I paying 80.00 to 90.00 for 1 brush!!</li>
            <li> Omg this brush is amazing its so sturdy and the hairs are super soft. I cant get over the quality of this brush..i will deff be purchasing more if i could give it 10 stars i would i recommend everyone ordering this brush if your into contouring</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> This brush is probably the softest one I&#x27;ve ever touched. Applies product beautifully and easily, and also seems extremely sturdy. I also may be oblivious, but I was not expecting the mini brush cleaning mitt that I received with my order and I cannot wait to use it! So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was moderately fast. Right out of the packaging, I didn&#x27;t notice any chemical smells that others have reported. It did come with the brush egg that was mentioned as a gift. That is mainly why I ordered this item. I used the brush and it works well for stippling the contour product precisely where you want it. It&#x27;s a little better than the e.l.f contour brush in terms of buffing out the product in an upwards motion. It picks up adequate amounts of product with little effort and powders that I used didn&#x27;t shake off too easy when I tried to tap the excess off. The only two things I didn&#x27;t like about this brush is that the bristles were a little too long/had a little too much give and the size of the handle. This handle is huge! Oh, the bristles are synthetic so cleaning the brush will be easy, especially with the brush egg. Once I used this brush after washing and drying, I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding so that&#x27;s a plus. Overall, this is a great contouring brush and definitely worth buying. I was taken aback by the quality!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH. SO SOFT</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this BEAUTIFUL BRUSH!!! I cannot express enough how much I love this brush. Works very well with contouring my cheek bones just like my Sigma brush. The built is awesome and looks very expensive. The price is beyond reasonable and the delivery is right on point!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Could be just a bit smaller</li>
            <li> Nicer than my MAC brushes. Dawn excellent quality as Shisedo Perfect Foundation brush. Dense,soft, deposits color evenly and beautifully. I can&#x27;t believe the price?!! I use for contour. If you&#x27;re on the fence just get it!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for contouring the face and nose.  Love it. Washes well.</li>
            <li> The width is too thick to effectively contour and blend</li>
            <li> Love. This. Brush!! So perfect zero complaints and super soft! It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive brushes! Happy blending! :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush and the seller even threw in the brush cleaner which I love, great brush for the price. I was contemplating between this and a MAC flat contouring brush as MAC always has great brushes but a bit pricey for my budget right now.,so happy I got this brush instead. Works great. Good quality for the price and arrived on time. Will order from this seller/ company again</li>
            <li> I wanted the Mac version, but I saw this and wanted it. The reviews were a big help, It&#x27;s so soft, light,and contours like but other brush I have.  It is a must have.Love this brush, I&#x27;m buying more soon.</li>
            <li> This is the brush for contouring that will give you razor-sharp cheekbones.  It has dense, high-quality bristles and a wide handle for more control.  It can pick up as much or as little product as you want.  It comes with a really helpful Makeup Brush Cleaning Tool you can use for most of your brushes (inset picture), and I find that the smaller the brush, the better the job it does…but it does do a great job on this Flat Contour Brush!  To keep it in the best condition, dry it lying flat after washing…do not stand it up so that water can settle at the base of the bristles.  I recommend this excellent bargain, high-quality brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month now, and it does the job really well.  Keep it clean to get the best results.  It still doesn&#x27;t shed, which is a problem with a lot of brushes from the reviews I&#x27;ve read (and I researched a lot).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and makes contouring a breeze. I washed the brush a couple times now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding and it&#x27;s still just as soft as the first day I got it. Not sure why some people are saying it smells like paint but I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my contouring of face. New fav!!!</li>
            <li> Being new to makeup. I found a contouring brush that made it for me to easily apply my bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush.  It is very densely packed, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like a lot of cheap brushes, and BONUS!  It comes with a little scrubbing pad!  I read some reviews about the initial strong scent of glue that hits you in the face when you first open the package, so I was prepared, but I either got lucky or others are really sensitive to the smell of glue.  I use this brush regularly for contouring; it picks up product really well and has no fallout while applying.  It does a really good job contouring the face; the bristles are really soft against my skin.  The one issue that I do have with this brush and the only reason it lost a star for me is that it is heavy and bulky.  My hands are small in general, so I&#x27;m not sure that this is legit complaint, but for me, I use a soft application method, so my makeup brushes need to just practically sit on my hands and glide over my skin, but because this brush is a little heavy, it makes it harder for me to use while contouring.  And I have tried holding the brush in several different ways to see if maybe there is a perfect way, but such is not the case.  In summary, I do recommend this makeup brush for contouring, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> When I recieved this brush, I immediately the next morning used it instead of my Nars Ita Brush. Oh my. This brush is an exact dupe for the Nars Ita brush! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars because of the smell but I did wash the brush with some soap and hot water it seems to help a lot and I absolutely love the shape of the brush it is exactly what I was looking for and the delivery didn&#x27;t take too long. I also received the brushegg cleaner and it will be a good help for cleaning all my brushes</li>
            <li> Good for contouring the cheeks</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It makes my contour look amazing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker then expected! The little brush cleaning tool is awesome! Works great with my beauty blenders!</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the contour on my face perfectly. Nice and dense. I use this to apply the contour then I use a different fluffy powder brush to blend. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies directly to where you want it. Wasn&#x27;t pleasant of the smell when I first got it but after it&#x27;s washed it is a good brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great..blends very well :)  i dont know why people are saying that it has a bad odor to it mine came just fine no weird chemical odor...im no make up artist i wanted to learn how to contour and this one definetly did the job for me! Im not one to buy high end brushes but this one feels like its very expensive the brush is very soft and is blends very well :) bonus it comes with a cleaner plus the brush came a few days earlier than expected! I reccomend this brush!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality! Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, sturdy strong handle... This brush makes it very easy to contour and I am so glad that I bought this one and gave it a try before forking out tons of money on a very similar one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONTOUR BRUSH.  IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, applies evenly and blends amazingly!! RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!! I was so exxited to recieve it i had to use it right away!!! It is so soft and my contour looks unbelievable, im gonna order back ups just incase i can&#x27;t find it again!!! Awesome brush and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> I love my new brush!! It works great and it came with a awesome gift. It spreads and blends my makeup well and it feels very nice on my skin. I would absolutely recommend this brush for anyone who loves their contouring!! The gift is a great add on (makeup brush cleaner) I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks and feels like it will work good.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviews have stated, the brush handle does have a very strong odor upon arrival. Not sure what kind of paint was used on the handle but the smell is very potent. The bristles are VERY soft and pick up a lot of product. To get rid of the smell from the brush handle, I just let nature take its course. The window in my bathroom was already open, so the brush simply aired  itself out. After 24 hrs the odor was gone. I don&#x27;t smell it when I use the brush now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is actually very good quality!</li>
            <li> I love it.  Thanks for a great and affordable product!</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible. It barely picked up any product and just didnt live up to my expectation.  I really want my money back but I dont want to go thru the hassle.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, rather large (which is what I wanted), very dense soft brush hairs. Handle is very thick (~diameter of a quarter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare to the Mac 163 contour brush, it is easier to place and blend products with this E2shop brush, although it is slightly more wide than the Mac brush. Mac handle also much more slender</li>
            <li> This brush is an okay brush however i&#x27;ve seen better ones. Perhaps it does it job just fine and the price is just good enough. Plus the brush cleaner for free is really awesome and helpful. Definitely use this when washing your brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and very sturdy - A must have piece in my makeup brush collection. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush. Soft and easy to use. It makes contouring easy.</li>
            <li> brush had  a weird smell like paint  thinner had  to  put it  out  to  air. Used it once.. not  able  to  say  much  more</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful contour brush! The bristles are very soft and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product!</li>
            <li> loved the brush this was what I was expected. I have not used it but when I do, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> THE PERFECT contouring brush for a remarkable price</li>
            <li> Very soft brush. Perfect for contouring.</li>
            <li> this brush is everything for contouring blends well is very soft is amazing!! Love itttt</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review and let me tell you this brush is amazing!!! Just got it today and I test it out.I was surprised how good it did its job. Brushes at sephora are pricy and this is perfect and cheap. I really do recommend it.You won&#x27;t REGRET IT!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and yet firm enough to control the placement of product. Easily my favorite brush. I&#x27;m not sure how well the glue holds it together since it&#x27;s brand new, but so far I dig it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great product! Thanks</li>
            <li> Very dense. Good for applying contour.  Would be better if it were just a tad less dense.</li>
            <li> I got the brush and tried it today I can only say woooooww, I did not need my finger as I use to with my old brush, it blended my cream foundation better than my finger of any other brush I ever used, I gave it a 4 stars just because it still early to know how long it will last and thank you for the cleaning tool it works very well I washed the brush before using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! I don&#x27;t even know what a &amp;#34;contour brush&amp;#34; is or what exactly you&#x27;re supposed to use it for, but I DO know that this is a great brush for applying foundation!  The wide width means I can apply my foundation in just a few strokes and the flat shape of the bristles prevents makeup from being forced into pores, so my foundation goes on very smoothly! I&#x27;m ordering a couple more to give as gifts!</li>
            <li> Best contour brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> I was so exited to find this brush at such a cheap price and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap! It actually works really well, I was so close to buying the NARS Ita brush and thank goodness I did not! this brush is sooooo soft and it really does help w/ my contouring. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It places my contour powder right were I need it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Contour brush that didn&#x27;t cost a arm and leg- I was going to go with the NARS, but changed my mind when I read the reviews and the price for this. It works very well! It was much thicker than I thought it would be, but it applys it very well. Just blend blend blend!!</li>
            <li> Great brush!! &amp; the brush egg is great</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for contouring your face. This brush seems to pick up the right amount of product so the contour shade isn&#x27;t  too dark or harsh.</li>
            <li> For less than 10 bucks I  got a good brush and cleaning  glove which I think  is a good  deal. Those who  do regular  makeup  known that  high end contour  brushes  cost much more and its not worth it. This does  the job at a fraction  of  the  cost.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush. It contours perfectl, especially if you know what you are doing. It does have a smell, but after a light wash it is fine. I hope they make a smaller one for  contouring the nose. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Grey brush high quality.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS LIKE PAINT BRUSH...NOT A MAKE UP ONE...:(...CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AMAZING AND HELPFULL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get use to it.  However, it works great contouring.</li>
            <li> Super soft  I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! I use it everyday to create an airbrush look with my Dermablend foundation. Amazin!</li>
            <li> I like it so mutch&lt;br /&gt;And soft</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase , I too was looking for the Nars Ita brush but this brush does the same job at only a fraction of the price. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> received product just as received.</li>
            <li> Definitely not just for girls :P this brush is simply the best I&#x27;ve tried for contouring, and as someone who has contoured daily for years trust me, this is glorious. It&#x27;s very dense so use a light hand at first because it can really stamp on a lot of product. Luckily it&#x27;s plush enough to blend everything out perfectly! This is just amazing, I would pay so much more for a brush like this but thank god I didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Top of the line quality, the E2shop brush is a high-grade synthetic makeup brush therefore; it is safe for sensitive skin. This brush is very soft, and very dense, and the bristles have uniform precision, there are NO longer or shorter bristle pieces that cheaper brushes sometimes have which leave streaks and blotches. This brush is useful for both cream products and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three main uses for the E2shop flat contour brush are for foundation, contour shaping and highlighting, and just the flat end of the brush is necessary for all applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a contour application, use the flat end of the brush to draw a line from the hairline across and directly under the cheekbone. This will define the cheek and give the cheeks a slight lifted appearance, then gently blend upward using small slight strokes. This is also for contouring along the jawline, which will give the face a little more definition and a more defined jawline. However, along the jaw in order to blend use gentle downward strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a touch of highlighting, this brush is perfect for both, a little highlighting above the cheekbone and down along the top of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this brush, it is 6 ½”, the bristles are thick, soft, and dense and the circumference of the smooth round wood handle is 2 ½” which gives me a good comfortable grip. This provides perfect control of my applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the E2shop flat contour brush for almost a month and a half and during this time I have washed this brush several times and it does not shed any bristles. I have owned more expensive makeup brushes that have not come close to this quality for a soft and dense synthetic makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation, and the usages, statements, and opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> This has become my secret weapon in the war of contouring. I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for the price. A must have.</li>
            <li> Has a slimey dirty feeling too it. It is TOO soft if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of contouring where you want it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush is totally worth it. It is a really great contour brush. Anybody could use it because of the simplicity of the brush. All you have to do is sweep back and forth in one straight line, and voila! Magical, ethereal contour done by little ol&#x27; you! I typically use it with a powder bronzer and I find that that works the best for my skin. But I&#x27;ve also used it to blend out the harshness from cream stick bronzers and it does an amazing job as well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only rating this 4.5/5 because of the funny chemical smell that it had when I first received it. I washed it before I used it and it was still there, but after a few uses and another wash, the smell is totally gone now.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is DEALS! You have to get it.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> sooo soft! It works great too!!</li>
            <li> love this brush.. very very soft on the skin. leaves make up flawless. perfect for contouring! recommend to all :)</li>
            <li> perfect for contouring !</li>
            <li> The brush was Okey., but I think my sister enjoy using it more then I do. She loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, to big for my cheek bone.  But I love the application of makeup that it applies.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the base holder is too thick and it does not pick up the product very evenly. I love the brush cleaner it comes with!</li>
            <li> This brush is a lot better than expected, also a lot bigger and dense. Like it a lot, great quality not only for the price but in general.</li>
            <li> Best contour brush I have ever used. Save your money and buy this</li>
            <li> Love makes contouring my cheeks and chin easy! Works like the Nars contour brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring! Absolutely love this brush!</li>
            <li> Too condense for countering but good for other things.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush a try and fell in love! Very dense, does a great job with bronzer and countouring. My go-to brush every day.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and extremely dense. It&#x27;s the perfect shape for buffing out your contour. I&#x27;ve had no shedding after washing it. The quality is absolutely amazing. Got it for less than $5 and it&#x27;s for sure one of my must have brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush great for beginners who are learning to contour.</li>
            <li> This brush runs about $15-$60 depending on the brand, but for this price I had to see and I&#x27;m in love. So soft and such a wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> BEST CONTOUR brush out their. Does the job and the PRICE is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is one of the softest brushes you will use on your face. The synthetic bristles are dense and firm enough for foundations, both liquid and cream. I purchased this for contouring and it works just as well as my old Nars contour brush that mysteriously vanished from my kit. I digress... I have washed it twice now and there is no shedding!! So go buy this brush. You will thank me and the other 5 star reviews later 💄💄💄💄💄</li>
            <li> This product came into the mail today and I&#x27;m so happy with it! The brush is so soft, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality for the little price I paid. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for contouring and is so comparable to the NARS ita brush which is 55 dollars.</li>
            <li> Loooooooooove this brush!! Great for contouring. Picks up a lot of product so be careful. Somewhat dense but soft.</li>
            <li> Loving this brush!!!!! Makes contouring so easy</li>
            <li> Definitely for body and not face.</li>
            <li> This the perfect contour brush and the price is a plus. I wanted to get the Nars Ita brush, but opted for this alternative. The bristles on the brush is dense and soft so it&#x27;s not harsh on the face. The denseness of the brush allows the product to go exactly where you want. I also received a free brush cleaning item.</li>
            <li> Great Brush! Soft and high quality. Will be using it for contour.</li>
            <li> The bruush is great but the seller didn&#x27;t include the brush cleaner</li>
            <li> As soon as I pulled it out the package and felt it...i immediately ordered 2 more. This is exactly what I need for my personal and professional makeup kit. It does have a slight paint smell but I immediately washed it with the brush egg that came with it. The smell is gone. I Cannot Wait To Use THIS Brush :)</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t what you see in the picture and the brush feels disgusting. Don&#x27;t recommend this at all!</li>
            <li> I love love this brush! This is the best contour brush ever, it gives you precise contour, you can use it for your nose too! Yes it does have a chemical smell, it&#x27;s like a permanent marker smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all! It does go away. This is gonna make my contouring a breeze</li>
            <li> Great brush. Blends easily</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for cream contouring. It feels amazing and is very precise for my ladies who love a sharp contour. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I had to sell it .... The brush seems have a lot wax on it, no matter how much I wash it I still get this waxy thing on my bronzer ! Ridiculous !</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and very dense. I use it for contouring like most people probably do and am loving it. I use this brush to lightly stamp on the color and blend it upwards and it does its job beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash this brush first though! Upon opening the packaging, it smelled heavily of chemicals and plastic. After a nice washing and leaving it out to dry on my Benjabelle brush tree, the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> love it, it came with a brush egg, to clean ur brushes and it works amazing</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and its actually a bit bigger than I expected but it works great for what I was looking to use it for (contouring on the cheeks) I would definitely recommend and it did show up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery! ;)</li>
            <li> Very good bristles...except after the first use the front part detached from the handle</li>
            <li> Giant and too dense for a contour brush, smell was potent too. Maybe good if I were to apply self tanner or apply face mask.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too thick for contour need another brush to blend because looks like too much and dusty</li>
            <li> This brush is totally a holly grail!!! Must have! First the hairs on the brush are extremely soft and after I washed it none of the hairs came out it kept it&#x27;s shape. Also when I apply my powder bronzer you can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing a powder bronzer it looks like I applied a cream bronzer so this brush leaves such an air brushed finish. The packing is also very great it&#x27;s sealed.</li>
            <li> Perfect contour brush! Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  Didn&#x27;t have any type of chemical smell like some people are reporting. Bought the full brush set after seeing what great quality it was.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush based on reviews for contouring. I find it too thick! The gift for washing brush made it a good buy for price!</li>
            <li> The brush is great quality! It hasn&#x27;t shed and it is very soft. The only thing is see as a negative is the size.. ITS HUGE! but i made it work. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush !!! It&#x27;s very well. It picks up a good amount of product. Cream or powder. Helps also blend the product beautifully. And love the bonus brush cleaner. Thank you!</li>
            <li> good brush. i like how dense it is. definitely compares to the high end ones</li>
            <li> Very soft brush. I can compare this brush to those highly priced brushes. Even compare to the new Nars ITA brush which is $80!!! This brush is amazing and blends very very well! Will definitely buy again from this brand! Good price and very reasonable!!!</li>
            <li> Omg best brush ever! I love this thing to death, and it&#x27;s so soft. The contuor is soft with this brush so it make you look so natural.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was because I wanted the free gift. I was expecting just a typical brush. But boy was I wrong!! This contour brush works better than the one I purchased at Mac &amp; Sephora. It gives you that perfect contour look. Now as for the brush cleaning free gift. That thing is a life saver. It cleaned all my brushes, super fast, taking off all the makeup. I loved it, my sister watched as I cleaned my brushes and now she wants one. So it looks like I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one lol. The shipping was extremely fast! I ordered it late&lt;br /&gt;at night, first thing next morning it was shipped, two days later I had it in my hands!! I would recommend everyone who struggles with cleaning their brushes to buy this. It&#x27;s such an amazing combination.</li>
            <li> great value and great brush for applying conture !</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but it had a terrible chemical paint smell that I couldn&#x27;t get over. Returning!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for contouring definitely worth the buy and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> did anyone else realized it smells like sharpie or paint</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Not as small as the MAC brand but serves the same purpose for half the price.</li>
            <li> Great product, good quality !!!!</li>
            <li> So soft and great quality. Bought this instead of the Nars Ita brush so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Feels  very sturdy. Bristles are dense but very soft. It was bigger than I expected and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been in the market for a good quality contour brush for a few months now. I just received this brush in the mail today and I LOVE IT!!!! It is exactly what I have been looking for. However there is a strong smell. I did read the reviews before purchasing this brush so it was expected. I am fully confident the smell will go away after I wash the brush. The brush egg is an amazing added bouns. Honestly for the price you need to buy this brush right now. Stop scrolling and just buy. If it wasnt for the smell this brush would 5 star quality!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was close to the ITA brush by NARS (a popular brush for contouring). I love it! It gets the perfect amount of product and the bristles are super soft! The included gift that helps clean make up brushes is stellar, as well! Very, very happy with this purchase! I believe shipping only took 3 business days, too.</li>
            <li> In love with the brush!!!!! PERFECT for powder countuiring!!!! I am definately purchasing another one for back up!!! Good quality brush, highly recommend it!!!!! Definately a 10 star for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beast on my contouring. The brush is super thick with no shedding. Love it...</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!☺&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite Contour brush ever. The quality is great! As good or even better than mac&#x27;s brushes, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little soft but i guess not.. i rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring. No bristles falling out either. Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Nice quality and a good shape for contouring and even buffing.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but I thought this brush would be comparable to the shape of the mac 163 flat contour brush, but it isn&#x27;t even close. This brush is flattish and has a wide head, but it isn&#x27;t actually flat enough to do a contour with. I have the anastasia contour kit and the brush is too wide and fat to work nicely with the pans. I don&#x27;t use this at all, it is just sitting in my makeup brush cups.</li>
            <li> Definitely overpriced. Found this much cheaper elsewhere. But the item did come quick and does look like the image. It did provide contour line on the cheeks. This is meant for the cheekbones. I would not use this to contour nose.  If it was cheaper (up to $3),  I would think it was worth it. You can use other brushes you have to do the same thing this does.  So for the price, I though this was a waste of money and just another brush taking up space.</li>
            <li> OMG THE QUALITY and the softness of this brush is the absolutely the best!!!</li>
            <li> Good contour brush and love the brush egg that it comes with- helps clean brushes very well.. The brush hair are very dense and smooth. Comparable to MAC and Estée Lauder. Priced reasonably as well..wish it was a little less wide in dimensions. But excellent quality!</li>
            <li> This brush wreaks of petrochemical odor, these are very cheap bristles, think the kind of fiber in a cheap wig, not to mention that this is 2.25&amp;#34; wide which is ridiculous, i have been a pro make up artist for 40 years and this is laughable, no wonder it is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush today, so I will update this if anything changes, but so far, I love this brush. I have to say that I was surprised that it was so luxuriously soft and so far, seems to be pretty well made.  After seeing the price, I thought it was probably going to be a piece of junk, but I wanted to try out this particular shape of brush as compared to a couple of others being that I am new to contouring and trying to figure out what works best for me as far as brush shapes.  I have a very small face structure, so it&#x27;s hard to even find a blush brush that isn&#x27;t too wide for my face. This seemed to be one of the narrower brushes, so I figured it might fit below my cheekbones pretty well without getting contour powder in the blush area. I love the control that this one gives me and how soft it feels. It&#x27;s soft, but still dense enough to be able to have control of the product. I also tried one of the contouring fan brushes (the Fan Me Beautifully one) and it seemed to spread the product out too much (I have little room to work with). This even works better for me than the Tarte Slenderizer brush (which is actually more for cream or pencil contour but I got it because I thought the small end might fit under my cheekbones better).  This brush may actually work well for blending pencil contour as well (I plan to try it soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It this leaves too harsh of a line for you (it didn&#x27;t for me), you can just blend it away (with the same brush or another one that is good for blending).  I have the Anastasia powder contour and it worked ok for me with this compact set.  I just rubbed about half of the brush through the powder and then applied.  The fact that the brush is quite long for the palette, actually works ok for me because the half of the brush without product helps me to blend what I just put on when I go back and forth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get the strong glue (or whatever that is -kind of a car engine oil)  smell.  It seemed to be on the bristles -not just the handle or ferrule, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  I washed it several times with shampoo and I don&#x27;t notice it now (although it&#x27;s not all the way dry yet). I did not see one hair come out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally, this is going to be my brush of choice for contouring -at least for the cheeks and around the jaw (probably all -but I need to play around with it some more to be sure about the rest of the face).</li>
            <li> Contouring have never been this easy.</li>
            <li> Nice brush!  Dense, soft and seems to be good quality.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Omg hands down best brush ever! Im obssesed with the quality! Seriously i would pay 20$ for this ! So soft and doesnt she&#x27;d! Definitely recommend this brush</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a brush to contour with, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $80 on the Nars ita brush! this brush is amazing, super dense and soft! perfect for contouring. shipping came at the early expecting date!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING!  The price is AMAZING! I have a lot of make up brushes and this is good quality, super soft, brush is full and doesn&#x27;t shed.  Super for contouring!  Received it in a few days from ordering!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as any high brand contour brush; maybe even better. Super soft, and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed, not one bit. So happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this brush it is amazing quality for so cheap. Shipping came on time this is just amazing I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING. I&#x27;d easily compare it to brushes that cost $50+. It is dense and soft and applies product like a dream. I just got it today and I am already about to purchase other brushes from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I have been drooling over the nars contour brush, but as said in previous reviews, I cannot spend $80 on one brush. I was very skeptical of this brush but figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it was a bust. Holy cow I love this brush! I just might keep it under my pillow at night for safe keeping. I have not actually laid eyes on the nars brush but honestly I don&#x27;t even care anymore. Seriously, buy this brush! You will not regret it! Oh and I almost forgot, the shipping was way faster than what the expected delivery date specified, so win win all around :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use a a contouring brush for my face. I didn&#x27;t really like this brush, it felt stiff and didn&#x27;t move with ease on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome brush. Perfect for contouring!</li>
            <li> The smell of the glue that holds the handle in is BONKERS toxic smelling! I washed the brush and the handle FELL OFF! Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is a nice brush...it&#x27;s just not out of the package and onto your skin kinda brush. Which one should really never do anyways. The brush is on the stiffer side but SOFT. Synthetic. 2&#x27; wide 3/4&amp;#34; thick. 6 1/2&amp;#34; long complete length. This is a great brush for contouring! If you want to do that multiple foundation shade contour look (Kim Kardashian made famous) this brush would blend it together quite well. That green 2 1/4&amp;#34; X 3&amp;#34; brush cleaner is pretty cool. Guess they throw that in due to the smell that knocks you out when you get the brush out of the sealed plastic. When you come to...you wash the brush on that green thing to get rid of the chemical glue smell. Good luck. I re-glued my handle with Fabritac. I do like this brush in the end. Once you put it back together and wash it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells like chemicals but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I was gone after washing.  I love this brush.  I am always reluctant to buy brushes that seem inexpensive because I think you get what you pay for.  this is not the case with this brush.  I purchased the Nars ita brush and was so disappointed I returned it.  All that hype and it was nothing special. Additionally, I felt it was too fluffy and I want a sharp contour not a fluffy rectangle brush.  If I wanted that I could just hold and blush brush flat and make it work.  This brush is perfect - not too wide and not so dense that it hurts. At this price, it&#x27;s a must buy.  also It came with a little brush cleaner.  Though I didn&#x27;t htink much of that, I lave that little thing too!!  I swirl my brushes in the beaty blender solid bar then rub against the cleaner and voila!  A perfectly clean brush.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The brush is kind of big. But it is perfect for contouring.</li>
