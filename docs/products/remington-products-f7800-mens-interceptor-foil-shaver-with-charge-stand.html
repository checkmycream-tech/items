            <li>Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li>so I will just say this gives me the best shave of any electric Ive used (bought 4 on Amazon alone) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave and excellent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The Remington F7-7800XCDN Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver is a perfectly serviceable beard cutter.</li>
            <li>This worked awesome on my husband.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it doesn’t irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And best of all, it doesn’t irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having been a long-time owner of Remington shavers I felt like this one did an excellent job shaving.  </li>
            <li>Very good over all.</li>
            <li>Excellent choice ...has self cleaning feature which is great considering the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best electric I&#x27;ve tried in years, despite its shortcomings, and is a good alternative to a blade-shave if I need to trim on the go.</li>
            <li>The power meter works great,  and it&#x27;ll save you 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>This Interceptor foil shaver works great for me.</li>
            <li>Doing this every couple of weeks will greatly minimize skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice shaver at a great price!</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me a perfect, close and smooth shave without irritation, it&#x27;s a great shaver</li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic shavers mostly but this is a very good one.  </li>
            <li>Good razor</li>
            <li>What this is good for is having it for times that using a manual is impractical.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>A shave from the F7 was decently good, but leaves what I call the \\&quot;noon shadow\\&quot;: you can&#x27;t see the beard</li>
            <li>This one does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the  Remington F7-7800XCDN is a good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind that, than this is a good midpriced option.</li>
            <li>Good saver but not as well made as others.</li>
            <li>Good to travel with.</li>
            <li>Every day after using it he just run it under the faucet and once a week or so, just pop off the head and dump the shavings that it collected and brush it with the included brush to give it a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the Remington F7-7800XCDN, I think I&#x27;ve found my permanent shaver, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The Remington F7-7800XCDN is a pretty good electric shaver, not the best, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>stand is handy</li>
            <li>Works on battery or plugged in, which is nice.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a charging stand that is nice but</li>
            <li>just not as nice as a manual</li>
            <li>Does a nice job,</li>
            <li>I kind of collect them.</li>
            <li>foil shavers go, this one has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>I doubt if most men will dampen their faces before shaving with an electric shaver, but with this it would be a good idea, and even put some soap on the face, as I do with my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have something that he can just use in between razor shaves.</li>
            <li>The head pivots nicely to conform to his face as he used it.</li>
            <li>One nice thing compared to the Philips shaver he has been using is that he can use the shaver while the cord is plugged in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it’s a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>One nice thing compared to the Philips shaver he has been using is that he can use the shaver while the cord is plugged in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it’s a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using disposable razor blades to shave, and I thought it might be nice for him to have something nice.  </li>
            <li>The shaving end contours nicely as it moves across your face and it seems to shave well.  </li>
            <li>F7-7800 shaver is good but Remington MS-3 shavers were smaller in size and the BEST for close shave.</li>
            <li>It works just fine to leave it on the charging stand, as it is fairly stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>F5 has smooth plastic ribs where your thumb would rest when shaving to give you a good grip.</li>
            <li>The F7-7800XCDN is fairly loud for an electric shaver but the vibration in the hand and on the face is perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice shaver, even if my family tends to do better with razor blades.</li>
            <li>My old Remington model had an excellent trimmer to do side burns, etc.  </li>
            <li>Fair price, but original replacement Screen and cutter is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a great, super smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>If you are considering the Braun 7 series look at this as well, I think it is a much better performer.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>The rotary ones are slightly better, but nothing comes close to a blade.</li>
            <li>Some of them were better than others but they all would irritate my neck to the point that I couldn&#x27;t use them without spending the rest of the day looking like I had some rash on my neck.</li>
            <li>I love taking it camping or on the road.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say that the F7 is more ergonomic and would be better for someone with impaired grip.  </li>
            <li>because these Remingtons gets more hairs in fewer passes, the irritation level is virtually non-existent.</li>
            <li>This took me by surprise even more.</li>
            <li>The F5 is still my favorite because I prefer the more-comfortable thumb grip.  </li>
            <li>love the fact</li>
            <li>and they often work better and give smoother shaves than women&#x27;s shavers usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine this would work best for a man with larger hands.</li>
            <li>He has had several electric razors over the years and this is the best one he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>However, it is much better than my Panasonic women’s razors.  </li>
            <li>just think that if they can make a razor that can make it over a man’s face, I bet they can make one that will shave my legs even better.</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers have mixed results, at best, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head follows face contours well, better than I</li>
            <li>We weren’t exactly sure how this was supposed to work at this angle.</li>
            <li>and I get a nice smooth look with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>) I love that you can use it with or without the cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that there aren&#x27;t a million settings or switches.  </li>
            <li>I think they are better for people with coarser</li>
            <li>I guess I should have asked more questions about hubby&#x27;s shaving habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>son is continuing to use it, as he does seem to like it more than the blades.  </li>
            <li>When I stood with him in the bathroom, and talked him through some things, it did work out much better.  </li>
            <li>Results wise, the Braun and Remington were pretty even.</li>
            <li>Shaver is very easy to clean and can be rinsed under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>However, it will get the job done right, just make sure to clean it fairly often, about once a week</li>
            <li>Both of these are fine shavers and are my top recommendations.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very good shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>Most important, it gives a close</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to operate and charge, and I will keep it for those times when how I look is more important than how I feel.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>For me this shaver shaves closer than the best multi-blade wet shavers available with ease.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This shaver takes it reasonably easy and doesn&#x27;t produce that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like an introductory electric shaver, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it just means that it&#x27;s not quite at the top of shavers.  </li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I never could use electric razors either, and I always assumed that it is because my stubble is just too fine.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this so far, for a quick shave</li>
            <li>display of minutes left of charge is great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the heads on both the F5 and the F7 can be soaped up and rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly light weight and well balanced.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, this shaver does not come as close to smooth as a blade does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His face was so smooth after he used it.</li>
            <li>Its also quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>It flicks out at 90 degrees and is lightly sprung.</li>
            <li>hey, they&#x27;re great even for adult skin) over your beard area after shaving, and you&#x27;ll see that the cotton ball has become distinctly gray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have excellent battery life, and can be used if you&#x27;re in a rush, which are the only real positives I can think of.</li>
            <li>in all, if you’re looking for a good shaver for someone with sensitive skin, you should give this one a try.o work at this angle.</li>
            <li>in all, if you’re looking for a good shaver for someone with sensitive skin, you should give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with it, so I was surprised by how well the F5 (and now the F7) works.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, easy to use and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good, easy to use razor that does the job in short order.</li>
            <li>We stick with the Remington brand because we are never disappointed.</li>
            <li>The Remington F7 is a fairly straightforward shaver with twin foil cylinder type blades.</li>
            <li>My legs are clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, while I wouldn&#x27;t say that this Remington is perfect, it does manage a nice close shave that, once finished, I can just clean up a little with my traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it works great when wet.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level.</li>
            <li>No, they didn’t work on the more curved part of my leg, or on the straight line in front.  </li>
            <li>The motor&#x27;s fairly powerful and feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good shaver though.</li>
            <li>And it worked very well on most areas, even on his 1/8 inch stubble.</li>
            <li>The Remington is really loud when used but it does give a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li>together not a bad shaver</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s F7 Interceptor shaver provides surprisingly good results as well a full complement of features that further impresses against it&#x27;s mid-range pricing.</li>
            <li>Full Capacity is 20 minutes and there is a 5 minute quick</li>
            <li>Its performance is as good as the disposable razor with the added convenience of being able to power it through charging it as compared to regularly buying new razor heads for the disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful I bought this shaver it has proved reliable over time,even battery charge indicator is accurate and the pop up trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Each one, this one included, does an adequate job of removing visible whiskers.</li>
            <li>There is a 5 minute quick-charge mode to get you started quickly if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different Remington razors over the years, and this is the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges quickly for cordless use in an upright stand you can keep by the sink.</li>
            <li>It does a good job though and is very useful to have when using a manual is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah as much as this is better than other electric shavers I have used I don&#x27;t think it will ever replace manuals.</li>
            <li>Close shaving and quite powerful, The charging stand is a plus, this way it&#x27;s always in full power.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it unlike some other makes and models and really handles the contours of your face, getting in nice and close without leaving any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>this kind of seemingly minor design stuff is important.</li>
            <li>It has a simple design which lends itself to being both easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>He actually made sure he had the “right kind” of stubble this time since I told him he had a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The device offers a reasonably close shave but more importantly does not leave the skin chaffed or irritated.</li>
            <li>the best electric shaver I have ever bought, I wont be going back to wet shaving ever.</li>
            <li>I have used it about 2 weeks and love it so far...</li>
            <li>If you shave daily this is a nice shaver........</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even THINK of using a Remington fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s nice that it shaves close and has either battery or plugged in, ultimately it&#x27;s not going to see a lot of use.</li>
            <li>So the charge time will be useful in that he will know when to plug it in.</li>
            <li>So the charge time will be useful in that he will know when to plug it in.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m trying to figure out if the young man just needs more practice with it.  </li>
            <li>The overall quality of this saver is not as high as the Panasonic or Braun shavers, but it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s around $70</li>
            <li>For me, shavers need to be powerful, comfortable and precise in the way they cut facial hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this new shaver for a gift!  </li>
            <li>On wet skin it glides smoothly and works much better.  </li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>What a fast shave!</li>
            <li>if you like the electronic gadgets, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay more than the current list price.</li>
            <li>my first foil shaver in fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a bit larger than most men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li>As expected - has a nice floating head.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s not water-proof, it does clean pretty easily and seems to handle water quite well with minor contact</li>
            <li>and so occasionally he will go three to five days without shaving as most shavers irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li>Just don’t expect to chat with someone in the next room and be able to carry a conversation.</li>
            <li>Just don’t expect to chat with someone in the next room and be able to carry a conversation.</li>
            <li>Running around in the morning in a hurry and having a dead shaver isn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>I had assumed it would go higher or change color to green, or have some kind of indicator to tell you when it was full.  </li>
            <li>It looks ok, though the plastic feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li>It looks ok, though the plastic feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li>Other things I liked with the F7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more that light up, the more power left in the battery (with corresponding markings next to the lights to indicate the percentage of battery left).  </li>
            <li>What I particularly love about this is the amber LED that shows how much battery power is left before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li>Battery has good performance and even has a digital &#x27;minutes left&#x27; indicator.</li>
            <li>I find the F5 to be more comfortable and to provide perfectly adequate grip, but the F7 is definitely a more sure grip in case you shave under extreme circumstances and REALLY need to make sure you&#x27;ve got a tight grip on that sucker (bivouacking on a face of K2, maybe?).  </li>
            <li>Sure it took going over some spots more times than it should&#x27;ve, but I&#x27;ve now had several reasonable shaves without a single drop of blood or ingrown</li>
            <li>So this is the first electric that has made me think about making the switch from manuals and that in itself is testament to how much I like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s shavers for a long time, as there is more variety</li>
            <li>’s good to have the time indicator on the shaver to display how long he has left.</li>
            <li>’s good to have the time indicator on the shaver to display how long he has left.</li>
            <li>The digital battery time remaining display is large and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for 60 minutes on a charge, with an LED countdown on the front to tell you how much time is left (and it seemed to be pretty accurate).  </li>
            <li>On sight, it looks kinda plasticky but the tilting head makes shaving around the corners of your face much easier and this feature is only available on the higher priced Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>To be honest, when I tried this F7, it did seem a little quicker, but that&#x27;s probably because the cutters on my F5 are about six months</li>
            <li>Compared it to a Braun shaver we already owned and the size is huge next to the braun.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Does not cut very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of Remington shavers over the years--most recently the F5-5800 which gives a reliable, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>quibble aside, I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>so I cant really say if this is a breakthrough design improvement in electric shavers of</li>
            <li>My husband was very displeased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>, so this isn&#x27;t much of a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the F5 and F7 really have \\&quot;bite.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>A close and fast shave with no irritation?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>The charger stand is designed very well in that it remains stable even with the shaver plugged in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, not on curved, not on straight?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and convenient for him.  </li>
            <li>There is a learning curve involved when moving from a razor to an electric shaver, and he was ready to make the change.  </li>
            <li>For him, his hair is lighter and but thicker under his chin, and finds that this does the trick when getting the hair that seems to grow so much faster.  </li>
            <li>Our bathroom doesn’t have much shelf or storage space.</li>
            <li>Our bathroom doesn’t have much shelf or storage space.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>very versatile.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really matter,</li>
            <li>It looks big, but fits either of my older sons&#x27; hands fine.  </li>
            <li>Having tried two previous models, I believe my face is suitably adjusted for electric shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks wise, its a bit bigger than other models.</li>
            <li>Let me say, not great, but pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It also juts out from the back at a right angle making it difficult to use successfully!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We gave it to the 17 year old to test--his first electric.  </li>
            <li>A full charge should last 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>A full charge should last 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>but you sure can feel its slight stubble if you touch your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found the more expensive shavers to be any better than this one, so if you are on the fence because of price, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to using it again after I have several days worth of beard growth, ready to dispense with on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The display initially reads 60 min., but the shaver runs for several more minutes even after reaching zero.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a quick charge feature that I like, since I often forget to charge my shaver when it gets low.  </li>
            <li>It tilts like my Pannys and seems to have a decent close shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband always used (he has a beard now) a decent blade, but I never thought to ask him why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>After finishing the complete shaving of my 5 day&#x27;s beard growth, it tells me I still have 56 minutes left in the charge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be required to only have to plug this baby in once a month, at the most, to have this shaver ready to go for me</li>
            <li>but it is large and loud.</li>
            <li>This one fits my hand better because it&#x27;s a little longer.</li>
            <li>a little more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really works by keeping blades in line with skin, quieter than old one too.</li>
            <li>The shave gets really close to the skin and this is by far the smoothest shave he&#x27;s had with an electric razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter and much quieter than my old Remington Titanium.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not well-versed in different razors enough to be able to compare, but this razor does work extremely well, better than other razors I&#x27;ve previously owned, but that could just because the technology is getting better in all electric razors.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very long time (it does not have a travel case), and I like this razor much better than the last Remington.</li>
            <li>This is at least the third one I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a clean shave with any of them (although I guess this could be the result of faulty technique on my part).  </li>
            <li>A-lot of foil shavers tend to be short squat &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t fit well in the hand and require a contortionist&#x27;s flexibility to hold your head in the proper position to get to the beard.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts several weeks without needing a charge but also when you do need a charge, it charges very fast.</li>
            <li>did the 24 hour first charge when it arrived here yesterday and the digital read-out told me I have 60 minutes of shave time on my new shaver.</li>
            <li>This could be handy, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably not terribly accurate (and will likely grow less accurate over time)</li>
            <li>Ive tried many electric shavers (Braun, Panasonic, Norelco of course) and they usually end up taking space in some junk drawer until I throw them out.</li>
            <li>First we&#x27;ll note the obvious positives.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for about a month and works well for try shaving, but takes longer to get a good close shave as other similar shavers from other companies.</li>
            <li>The battery is NiMH (same as the F5), which doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much of a problem as the old NiCad batteries with developing memory, but it does still have it to some extent.  </li>
            <li>This shaver takes care of both with ease and makes my head feel completely bald even if you run your hand against the growth.</li>
            <li>You plug the shaver directly into the cord.  </li>
            <li>like that it&#x27;s rechargeable, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my normally sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have worn a beard since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li>only thing missing really is a travel case but aside from that this is a simple, elegant product that fully delivers.</li>
            <li>Was it old age?  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old son loves this Remington Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver.  </li>
            <li>He is pleasantly surprised with how close it shaves.  </li>
            <li>A bit bulkier in size, but not heavy.</li>
            <li>, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend cleaning it directly under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The manual talks about five different models and recommends charging for a straight 24 hours before use.</li>
            <li>husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, he was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>You can charge the shaver directly with the cord, or via the stand (with the cord plugged into the stand).</li>
            <li>You can charge the shaver directly with the cord, or via the stand (with the cord plugged into the stand).</li>
            <li>I got this for my 17 year old son.  </li>
            <li>He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring</li>
            <li>He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring</li>
            <li>And as the screen gets older, it leaves even more residue behind.  </li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite thing about electric shavers is cleaning them, but at least this one dissembles easily</li>
            <li>the end it worked quickly and easily and the only minor complaint was that it was quite loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the end it worked quickly and easily and the only minor complaint was that it was quite loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges up quickly and actually holds a long lasting charge.</li>
            <li>you can either charge it in it&#x27;s stand or plug in the power cord directly to the shaver or you can do a 5 minute quick charge if the battery is down &amp; you&#x27;ll have enough power to do your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recycled an old one, but a semi-hard traveling case should at least be available as an add-on option.</li>
            <li>He generally doesn&#x27;t shave during the weekend</li>
            <li>Physical design is masculine and minimalist.</li>
            <li>Plus, if it doesn&#x27;t work out for him, there&#x27;s the 15 year old, or I can box it up for the younger boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a Gillette Sensor kind of fellow, though I take a stab at electrics every few years.  </li>
            <li>It did get a pretty close shave, but he said it pulled some hairs out and drew a little blood.</li>
            <li>have not been very effective on my tough thick stubble and head hair</li>
            <li>This F7 has a digital display that shows you approximately how many minutes of runtime you have left.  </li>
            <li>So if I wake up late, don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use a blade, and have to be at work quickly, I can use this to make myself presentable for a day of work.</li>
            <li>The F7 not only cut closer than the tri-blades at half the cost, it was much easier on my skin.  </li>
            <li>power button on the F5 seems a little easier to find instantly without looking due to it sticking out slightly more when sliding your thumb down from the aforementioned thumb-grip</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Its an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li> so I will just say this gives me the best shave of any electric Ive used (bought 4 on Amazon alone) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave and excellent trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The Remington F7-7800XCDN Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver is a perfectly serviceable beard cutter.</li>
            <li> This worked awesome on my husband.</li>
            <li> And best of all, it doesn’t irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And best of all, it doesn’t irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having been a long-time owner of Remington shavers I felt like this one did an excellent job shaving.  </li>
            <li> Very good over all.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice ...has self cleaning feature which is great considering the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best electric I&#x27;ve tried in years, despite its shortcomings, and is a good alternative to a blade-shave if I need to trim on the go.</li>
            <li> The power meter works great,  and it&#x27;ll save you 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> This Interceptor foil shaver works great for me.</li>
            <li> Doing this every couple of weeks will greatly minimize skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice shaver at a great price!</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives me a perfect, close and smooth shave without irritation, it&#x27;s a great shaver</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers mostly but this is a very good one.  </li>
            <li> Good razor</li>
            <li> What this is good for is having it for times that using a manual is impractical.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> A shave from the F7 was decently good, but leaves what I call the \\&quot;noon shadow\\&quot;: you can&#x27;t see the beard</li>
            <li> This one does a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the  Remington F7-7800XCDN is a good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind that, than this is a good midpriced option.</li>
            <li> Good saver but not as well made as others.</li>
            <li> Good to travel with.</li>
            <li> Every day after using it he just run it under the faucet and once a week or so, just pop off the head and dump the shavings that it collected and brush it with the included brush to give it a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the Remington F7-7800XCDN, I think I&#x27;ve found my permanent shaver, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The Remington F7-7800XCDN is a pretty good electric shaver, not the best, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> stand is handy</li>
            <li> Works on battery or plugged in, which is nice.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a charging stand that is nice but</li>
            <li> just not as nice as a manual</li>
            <li> Does a nice job,</li>
            <li> I kind of collect them.</li>
            <li> foil shavers go, this one has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> I doubt if most men will dampen their faces before shaving with an electric shaver, but with this it would be a good idea, and even put some soap on the face, as I do with my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have something that he can just use in between razor shaves.</li>
            <li> The head pivots nicely to conform to his face as he used it.</li>
            <li> One nice thing compared to the Philips shaver he has been using is that he can use the shaver while the cord is plugged in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it’s a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> One nice thing compared to the Philips shaver he has been using is that he can use the shaver while the cord is plugged in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it’s a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using disposable razor blades to shave, and I thought it might be nice for him to have something nice.  </li>
            <li> The shaving end contours nicely as it moves across your face and it seems to shave well.  </li>
            <li> F7-7800 shaver is good but Remington MS-3 shavers were smaller in size and the BEST for close shave.</li>
            <li> It works just fine to leave it on the charging stand, as it is fairly stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> F5 has smooth plastic ribs where your thumb would rest when shaving to give you a good grip.</li>
            <li> The F7-7800XCDN is fairly loud for an electric shaver but the vibration in the hand and on the face is perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice shaver, even if my family tends to do better with razor blades.</li>
            <li> My old Remington model had an excellent trimmer to do side burns, etc.  </li>
            <li> Fair price, but original replacement Screen and cutter is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a great, super smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering the Braun 7 series look at this as well, I think it is a much better performer.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The rotary ones are slightly better, but nothing comes close to a blade.</li>
            <li> Some of them were better than others but they all would irritate my neck to the point that I couldn&#x27;t use them without spending the rest of the day looking like I had some rash on my neck.</li>
            <li> I love taking it camping or on the road.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say that the F7 is more ergonomic and would be better for someone with impaired grip.  </li>
            <li> because these Remingtons gets more hairs in fewer passes, the irritation level is virtually non-existent.</li>
            <li> This took me by surprise even more.</li>
            <li> The F5 is still my favorite because I prefer the more-comfortable thumb grip.  </li>
            <li> love the fact</li>
            <li> and they often work better and give smoother shaves than women&#x27;s shavers usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I imagine this would work best for a man with larger hands.</li>
            <li> He has had several electric razors over the years and this is the best one he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> However, it is much better than my Panasonic women’s razors.  </li>
            <li> just think that if they can make a razor that can make it over a man’s face, I bet they can make one that will shave my legs even better.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers have mixed results, at best, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head follows face contours well, better than I</li>
            <li> We weren’t exactly sure how this was supposed to work at this angle.</li>
            <li> and I get a nice smooth look with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> ) I love that you can use it with or without the cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that there aren&#x27;t a million settings or switches.  </li>
            <li> I think they are better for people with coarser</li>
            <li> I guess I should have asked more questions about hubby&#x27;s shaving habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> son is continuing to use it, as he does seem to like it more than the blades.  </li>
            <li> When I stood with him in the bathroom, and talked him through some things, it did work out much better.  </li>
            <li> Results wise, the Braun and Remington were pretty even.</li>
            <li> Shaver is very easy to clean and can be rinsed under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> However, it will get the job done right, just make sure to clean it fairly often, about once a week</li>
            <li> Both of these are fine shavers and are my top recommendations.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very good shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> Most important, it gives a close</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to operate and charge, and I will keep it for those times when how I look is more important than how I feel.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> For me this shaver shaves closer than the best multi-blade wet shavers available with ease.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes it reasonably easy and doesn&#x27;t produce that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like an introductory electric shaver, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it just means that it&#x27;s not quite at the top of shavers.  </li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I never could use electric razors either, and I always assumed that it is because my stubble is just too fine.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this so far, for a quick shave</li>
            <li> display of minutes left of charge is great.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the heads on both the F5 and the F7 can be soaped up and rinsed off.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly light weight and well balanced.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, this shaver does not come as close to smooth as a blade does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His face was so smooth after he used it.</li>
            <li> Its also quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> It flicks out at 90 degrees and is lightly sprung.</li>
            <li> hey, they&#x27;re great even for adult skin) over your beard area after shaving, and you&#x27;ll see that the cotton ball has become distinctly gray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have excellent battery life, and can be used if you&#x27;re in a rush, which are the only real positives I can think of.</li>
            <li> in all, if you’re looking for a good shaver for someone with sensitive skin, you should give this one a try.o work at this angle.</li>
            <li> in all, if you’re looking for a good shaver for someone with sensitive skin, you should give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with it, so I was surprised by how well the F5 (and now the F7) works.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, easy to use and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good, easy to use razor that does the job in short order.</li>
            <li> We stick with the Remington brand because we are never disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Remington F7 is a fairly straightforward shaver with twin foil cylinder type blades.</li>
            <li> My legs are clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, while I wouldn&#x27;t say that this Remington is perfect, it does manage a nice close shave that, once finished, I can just clean up a little with my traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it works great when wet.  </li>
            <li> Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level.</li>
            <li> No, they didn’t work on the more curved part of my leg, or on the straight line in front.  </li>
            <li> The motor&#x27;s fairly powerful and feels smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good shaver though.</li>
            <li> And it worked very well on most areas, even on his 1/8 inch stubble.</li>
            <li> The Remington is really loud when used but it does give a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li> together not a bad shaver</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s F7 Interceptor shaver provides surprisingly good results as well a full complement of features that further impresses against it&#x27;s mid-range pricing.</li>
            <li> Full Capacity is 20 minutes and there is a 5 minute quick</li>
            <li> Its performance is as good as the disposable razor with the added convenience of being able to power it through charging it as compared to regularly buying new razor heads for the disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful I bought this shaver it has proved reliable over time,even battery charge indicator is accurate and the pop up trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Each one, this one included, does an adequate job of removing visible whiskers.</li>
            <li> There is a 5 minute quick-charge mode to get you started quickly if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different Remington razors over the years, and this is the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges quickly for cordless use in an upright stand you can keep by the sink.</li>
            <li> It does a good job though and is very useful to have when using a manual is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah as much as this is better than other electric shavers I have used I don&#x27;t think it will ever replace manuals.</li>
            <li> Close shaving and quite powerful, The charging stand is a plus, this way it&#x27;s always in full power.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it unlike some other makes and models and really handles the contours of your face, getting in nice and close without leaving any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> this kind of seemingly minor design stuff is important.</li>
            <li> It has a simple design which lends itself to being both easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> He actually made sure he had the “right kind” of stubble this time since I told him he had a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The device offers a reasonably close shave but more importantly does not leave the skin chaffed or irritated.</li>
            <li> the best electric shaver I have ever bought, I wont be going back to wet shaving ever.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 2 weeks and love it so far...</li>
            <li> If you shave daily this is a nice shaver........</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even THINK of using a Remington fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s nice that it shaves close and has either battery or plugged in, ultimately it&#x27;s not going to see a lot of use.</li>
            <li> So the charge time will be useful in that he will know when to plug it in.</li>
            <li> So the charge time will be useful in that he will know when to plug it in.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m trying to figure out if the young man just needs more practice with it.  </li>
            <li> The overall quality of this saver is not as high as the Panasonic or Braun shavers, but it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s around $70</li>
            <li> For me, shavers need to be powerful, comfortable and precise in the way they cut facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new shaver for a gift!  </li>
            <li> On wet skin it glides smoothly and works much better.  </li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> What a fast shave!</li>
            <li> if you like the electronic gadgets, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay more than the current list price.</li>
            <li> my first foil shaver in fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a bit larger than most men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> As expected - has a nice floating head.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s not water-proof, it does clean pretty easily and seems to handle water quite well with minor contact</li>
            <li> and so occasionally he will go three to five days without shaving as most shavers irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li> Just don’t expect to chat with someone in the next room and be able to carry a conversation.</li>
            <li> Just don’t expect to chat with someone in the next room and be able to carry a conversation.</li>
            <li> Running around in the morning in a hurry and having a dead shaver isn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> I had assumed it would go higher or change color to green, or have some kind of indicator to tell you when it was full.  </li>
            <li> It looks ok, though the plastic feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li> It looks ok, though the plastic feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li> Other things I liked with the F7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more that light up, the more power left in the battery (with corresponding markings next to the lights to indicate the percentage of battery left).  </li>
            <li> What I particularly love about this is the amber LED that shows how much battery power is left before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> Battery has good performance and even has a digital &#x27;minutes left&#x27; indicator.</li>
            <li> I find the F5 to be more comfortable and to provide perfectly adequate grip, but the F7 is definitely a more sure grip in case you shave under extreme circumstances and REALLY need to make sure you&#x27;ve got a tight grip on that sucker (bivouacking on a face of K2, maybe?).  </li>
            <li> Sure it took going over some spots more times than it should&#x27;ve, but I&#x27;ve now had several reasonable shaves without a single drop of blood or ingrown</li>
            <li> So this is the first electric that has made me think about making the switch from manuals and that in itself is testament to how much I like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s shavers for a long time, as there is more variety</li>
            <li> ’s good to have the time indicator on the shaver to display how long he has left.</li>
            <li> ’s good to have the time indicator on the shaver to display how long he has left.</li>
            <li> The digital battery time remaining display is large and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for 60 minutes on a charge, with an LED countdown on the front to tell you how much time is left (and it seemed to be pretty accurate).  </li>
            <li> On sight, it looks kinda plasticky but the tilting head makes shaving around the corners of your face much easier and this feature is only available on the higher priced Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I tried this F7, it did seem a little quicker, but that&#x27;s probably because the cutters on my F5 are about six months</li>
            <li> Compared it to a Braun shaver we already owned and the size is huge next to the braun.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Does not cut very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Remington shavers over the years--most recently the F5-5800 which gives a reliable, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> quibble aside, I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> so I cant really say if this is a breakthrough design improvement in electric shavers of</li>
            <li> My husband was very displeased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> , so this isn&#x27;t much of a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the F5 and F7 really have \\&quot;bite.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> A close and fast shave with no irritation?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> The charger stand is designed very well in that it remains stable even with the shaver plugged in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, not on curved, not on straight?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and convenient for him.  </li>
            <li> There is a learning curve involved when moving from a razor to an electric shaver, and he was ready to make the change.  </li>
            <li> For him, his hair is lighter and but thicker under his chin, and finds that this does the trick when getting the hair that seems to grow so much faster.  </li>
            <li> Our bathroom doesn’t have much shelf or storage space.</li>
            <li> Our bathroom doesn’t have much shelf or storage space.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> very versatile.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really matter,</li>
            <li> It looks big, but fits either of my older sons&#x27; hands fine.  </li>
            <li> Having tried two previous models, I believe my face is suitably adjusted for electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks wise, its a bit bigger than other models.</li>
            <li> Let me say, not great, but pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It also juts out from the back at a right angle making it difficult to use successfully!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We gave it to the 17 year old to test--his first electric.  </li>
            <li> A full charge should last 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> A full charge should last 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> but you sure can feel its slight stubble if you touch your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found the more expensive shavers to be any better than this one, so if you are on the fence because of price, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to using it again after I have several days worth of beard growth, ready to dispense with on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The display initially reads 60 min., but the shaver runs for several more minutes even after reaching zero.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a quick charge feature that I like, since I often forget to charge my shaver when it gets low.  </li>
            <li> It tilts like my Pannys and seems to have a decent close shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband always used (he has a beard now) a decent blade, but I never thought to ask him why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> After finishing the complete shaving of my 5 day&#x27;s beard growth, it tells me I still have 56 minutes left in the charge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be required to only have to plug this baby in once a month, at the most, to have this shaver ready to go for me</li>
            <li> but it is large and loud.</li>
            <li> This one fits my hand better because it&#x27;s a little longer.</li>
            <li> a little more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really works by keeping blades in line with skin, quieter than old one too.</li>
            <li> The shave gets really close to the skin and this is by far the smoothest shave he&#x27;s had with an electric razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter and much quieter than my old Remington Titanium.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not well-versed in different razors enough to be able to compare, but this razor does work extremely well, better than other razors I&#x27;ve previously owned, but that could just because the technology is getting better in all electric razors.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time (it does not have a travel case), and I like this razor much better than the last Remington.</li>
            <li> This is at least the third one I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a clean shave with any of them (although I guess this could be the result of faulty technique on my part).  </li>
            <li> A-lot of foil shavers tend to be short squat &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t fit well in the hand and require a contortionist&#x27;s flexibility to hold your head in the proper position to get to the beard.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts several weeks without needing a charge but also when you do need a charge, it charges very fast.</li>
            <li> did the 24 hour first charge when it arrived here yesterday and the digital read-out told me I have 60 minutes of shave time on my new shaver.</li>
            <li> This could be handy, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably not terribly accurate (and will likely grow less accurate over time)</li>
            <li> Ive tried many electric shavers (Braun, Panasonic, Norelco of course) and they usually end up taking space in some junk drawer until I throw them out.</li>
            <li> First we&#x27;ll note the obvious positives.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month and works well for try shaving, but takes longer to get a good close shave as other similar shavers from other companies.</li>
            <li> The battery is NiMH (same as the F5), which doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much of a problem as the old NiCad batteries with developing memory, but it does still have it to some extent.  </li>
            <li> This shaver takes care of both with ease and makes my head feel completely bald even if you run your hand against the growth.</li>
            <li> You plug the shaver directly into the cord.  </li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s rechargeable, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my normally sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have worn a beard since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li> only thing missing really is a travel case but aside from that this is a simple, elegant product that fully delivers.</li>
            <li> Was it old age?  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old son loves this Remington Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver.  </li>
            <li> He is pleasantly surprised with how close it shaves.  </li>
            <li> A bit bulkier in size, but not heavy.</li>
            <li> , I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend cleaning it directly under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The manual talks about five different models and recommends charging for a straight 24 hours before use.</li>
            <li> husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, he was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> You can charge the shaver directly with the cord, or via the stand (with the cord plugged into the stand).</li>
            <li> You can charge the shaver directly with the cord, or via the stand (with the cord plugged into the stand).</li>
            <li> I got this for my 17 year old son.  </li>
            <li> He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring</li>
            <li> He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring</li>
            <li> And as the screen gets older, it leaves even more residue behind.  </li>
            <li> Probably my least favorite thing about electric shavers is cleaning them, but at least this one dissembles easily</li>
            <li> the end it worked quickly and easily and the only minor complaint was that it was quite loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the end it worked quickly and easily and the only minor complaint was that it was quite loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges up quickly and actually holds a long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> you can either charge it in it&#x27;s stand or plug in the power cord directly to the shaver or you can do a 5 minute quick charge if the battery is down &amp; you&#x27;ll have enough power to do your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recycled an old one, but a semi-hard traveling case should at least be available as an add-on option.</li>
            <li> He generally doesn&#x27;t shave during the weekend</li>
            <li> Physical design is masculine and minimalist.</li>
            <li> Plus, if it doesn&#x27;t work out for him, there&#x27;s the 15 year old, or I can box it up for the younger boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Gillette Sensor kind of fellow, though I take a stab at electrics every few years.  </li>
            <li> It did get a pretty close shave, but he said it pulled some hairs out and drew a little blood.</li>
            <li> have not been very effective on my tough thick stubble and head hair</li>
            <li> This F7 has a digital display that shows you approximately how many minutes of runtime you have left.  </li>
            <li> So if I wake up late, don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use a blade, and have to be at work quickly, I can use this to make myself presentable for a day of work.</li>
            <li> The F7 not only cut closer than the tri-blades at half the cost, it was much easier on my skin.  </li>
            <li> power button on the F5 seems a little easier to find instantly without looking due to it sticking out slightly more when sliding your thumb down from the aforementioned thumb-grip</li>
            <li> This has a quick charge of 5 min which I like as I sometimes tend to forget to charge and waiting for the shaver is not a good thing especially in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is quite large and probably not for small hands.</li>
            <li> Stubble can only be removed by shaking and brushing it out, and, somehow, there always seems to be far less coming out</li>
            <li> The fact that you can use the Remington with a cord also means that it is likely to stick around for a long time --</li>
            <li> If you are looking in this range and want something that will last a long time, then go with the Interceptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It’s an orange/amber color and kept displaying 60 no matter how long I left it charging.</li>
            <li> that I am generally not a fan of electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> particular model has a small digital readout that blinks at you.</li>
            <li> There have been a few times when the old Philips shaver would run out mid shave</li>
            <li> There have been a few times when the old Philips shaver would run out mid shave</li>
            <li> My Braun (a relatively compact size one for international travel) is at least ten years old and still cuts as well as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I find the numbers are harder to read than digital LCD displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also like the fact that this has a indicator to inform how long before I have to charge it.</li>
            <li> I only used the shaver on wet skin with shaving lotion, so</li>
            <li> I leave this out on my dressing table, minus the cord, and use it every day on my legs before I go for my swim, and only need to return it to its charger about once a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, when I selected this one, it was because of its similarity in style to my last two razors that were both pink.  </li>
            <li> They take too long to shave and this one does also.</li>
            <li> but I actually prefer the line gauge to the LED digital display which shows the number of minutes (counting down from 60) of battery time remaining.  </li>
            <li> The digital read-out was a little confusing at first.</li>
            <li> On my other shaver, if it runs out, you have to let it charge back up before you can use</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also has a slightly larger shaving head than other shavers I&#x27;ve seen, which means it does the job faster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real drawback of Remingtons is that their screens (like every Remington I&#x27;ve ever tried), subtly blacken your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It works well, and though loud it’s not so loud as to be irritating.</li>
            <li> It works well, and though loud it’s not so loud as to be irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid foil shavers aren&#x27;t on friendly terms with my skin, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> For that reason I only rate this an average shaver.</li>
            <li> down side, for this or any electric, is that despite all their claims to the contrary on the box marketing, it simply does not cut as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on dry skin and didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as on wet skin.  </li>
            <li> It was only below the chin that it struggled a little and this is where the flip out trimmer comes into play.</li>
            <li> There were times I ended up with large angry red patches on my neck.</li>
            <li> TheF7 sounds a bit different from the F5, maybe just a tiny bit quieter, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have had to put up with wet shaving, which I detest.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any shaving irritation I got from wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I do like the base that comes with the F7, but you&#x27;ll have to decide if that&#x27;s an important enough feature to pay the extra for the F7.  </li>
            <li> instructions specify that it is, under absolutely no condition, be used wet or immersed in water, and the head is not removable, which combine to make cleaning a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a charger itself, just has a pass through connection for the cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But he did have some trouble navigating his upper lip.  </li>
            <li> and he would have to dig out his wet shaver to finish the job.</li>
            <li> and he would have to dig out his wet shaver to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Remington F7-7800XCDN shaver is essentially the same as the F5-5800 except for the fact that it comes with a stand and that the battery gauge is digital as opposed to the less expensive model, which has an LED fuel-type gauge instead of actual numbers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a good dry shaver, which I discovered when I used it before I ran out of the house with bare legs.  </li>
            <li> The reason I rated it a 3 was due to the noise and size when packing for a trip.</li>
            <li> if I just should of tried a Remington before wasting money on the other brands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave at all, and tends to pull, which has caused some skin irritation (this has never been a problem for me with other shavers or with razors).</li>
            <li> This one is a bit bulky compared to my other and it just isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The cap with the two foils can be pulled off to reveal the cylindrical blades which will have to be cleaned from time to time with the small double headed brush that’s provided for this purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This boasts that it costs less than other men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I paid for overnight shipping</li>
            <li> Max capacity is listed at 60 minutes and the average shave for myself knocks it down 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>

            <li> I returned this shaver because it did a very poor job on my neck and the foil irritated my face, unlike the Braun&#x27;s Series 7.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading all the reviews. This is what I have found. Past electric shavers  I have owned  have not been very effective on my tough thick stubble and head hair so I have had to put up with wet shaving, which I detest. This shaver takes care of both with ease and makes my head feel completely bald even if you run your hand against the growth. For me this shaver shaves closer than the best multi-blade wet shavers available with ease. I no longer have any shaving irritation I got from wet shaving.I am very thankful I bought this shaver it has proved reliable over time,even battery charge indicator is accurate and the pop up trimmer is fantastic. Absolutely. the best electric shaver I have ever bought, I wont be going back to wet shaving ever. If you are considering the Braun 7 series look at this as well, I think it is a much better performer.</li>
            <li> Same as the F5800. Just without a digital display. The power meter works great,  and it&#x27;ll save you 20 bucks. Its an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  I have used it about 2 weeks and love it so far...some of the complaints I read about in this list were trivial to me.  Good razor</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> With what this Remington accomplishes I&#x27;ll probably never use a blade again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li> F7-7800 shaver is good but Remington MS-3 shavers were smaller in size and the BEST for close shave. I miss them.</li>
            <li> Does not cut very well</li>
            <li> Excellent choice ...has self cleaning feature which is great considering the price. Get a ckezn shave all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid foil shavers aren&#x27;t on friendly terms with my skin, especially on my neck. The rotary ones are slightly better, but nothing comes close to a blade. I hold out hope for foil razors, though. My Braun (a relatively compact size one for international travel) is at least ten years old and still cuts as well as the day I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, but works with the cord. The fact that you can use the Remington with a cord also means that it is likely to stick around for a long time -- this kind of seemingly minor design stuff is important. I haven&#x27;t found the more expensive shavers to be any better than this one, so if you are on the fence because of price, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Works fine but it is large and loud. Compared it to a Braun shaver we already owned and the size is huge next to the braun. The Remington is really loud when used but it does give a pretty good shave.  Results wise, the Braun and Remington were pretty even. The reason I rated it a 3 was due to the noise and size when packing for a trip. The shave was at least a 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Remington shavers over the years--most recently the F5-5800 which gives a reliable, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Remington F7-7800XCDN shaver is essentially the same as the F5-5800 except for the fact that it comes with a stand and that the battery gauge is digital as opposed to the less expensive model, which has an LED fuel-type gauge instead of actual numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is handy but I actually prefer the line gauge to the LED digital display which shows the number of minutes (counting down from 60) of battery time remaining.  I find the numbers are harder to read than digital LCD displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That quibble aside, I really like this shaver.  It has a nice weight to it unlike some other makes and models and really handles the contours of your face, getting in nice and close without leaving any razor burn.  There&#x27;s also a pop-up trimmer which isn&#x27;t as flimsy as the competition&#x27;s and the 60 minutes-worth of battery means it will probably last you through a week&#x27;s vacation even if you forgot to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good shaver. Very smooth, clean shave. Easy to use. Works on battery or plugged in, which is nice. On my other shaver, if it runs out, you have to let it charge back up before you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, and its not that much better then some of the cheaper options. If you are looking in this range and want something that will last a long time, then go with the Interceptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many electric shavers (Braun, Panasonic, Norelco of course) and they usually end up taking space in some junk drawer until I throw them out. Some of them were better than others but they all would irritate my neck to the point that I couldn&#x27;t use them without spending the rest of the day looking like I had some rash on my neck. So I stuck to my trusty razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is the only one that I can use without that irritation. I have never used a Remington before so I cant really say if this is a breakthrough design improvement in electric shavers of if I just should of tried a Remington before wasting money on the other brands. So this is the first electric that has made me think about making the switch from manuals and that in itself is testament to how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said manual razors will never be totally replaced. My issue is there&#x27;s a lot of times I wont shave for a few days, usually the weekends. I do not recommend trying to take on 3 days of growth with this or any electric. I tried it with this one and just trust me it wont handle it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display of minutes left of charge is great. There&#x27;s a charging stand that is nice but probably something I will never use I just plug it in when it needs it. It will run while plugged in  but if its kept charged I don&#x27;t see why Id use it plugged in.  It does a good job though and is very useful to have when using a manual is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah as much as this is better than other electric shavers I have used I don&#x27;t think it will ever replace manuals. What this is good for is having it for times that using a manual is impractical. I love taking it camping or on the road. I don&#x27;t want to make this an electric vs manual discussion so I will just say this gives me the best shave of any electric Ive used (bought 4 on Amazon alone) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all. If you shave daily this is a nice shaver........just not as nice as a manual haha!</li>
            <li> Had Remingtons for years, finally wore out last one. This one fits my hand better because it&#x27;s a little longer. Didn&#x27;t know if I would like pivoting head but it really works by keeping blades in line with skin, quieter than old one too. Does a nice job,</li>
            <li> This Interceptor foil shaver works great for me. I like the 3 stage cutting system which seems to allow me to cut closer to my face, though it is pretty bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that this has a indicator to inform how long before I have to charge it. This has a quick charge of 5 min which I like as I sometimes tend to forget to charge and waiting for the shaver is not a good thing especially in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent shaver!</li>
            <li> My husband was very displeased with this shaver. He has a very thick beard and it did not cut through as he expected it to.</li>
            <li> If you are weighing this F7 (7800) against the [[ASIN:B00BB5YHEI F5 (5800)]], you might be wondering what the differences are, aside from what is currently about a $22 difference in price points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The F5 does not have a base.  You plug the shaver directly into the cord.  This F7 can also be plugged directly into the cord, but it comes with a base that you can (optionally) plug the cord into, and then the shaver plugs into the base, which holds it upright.  I like having a base because it&#x27;s quicker and keeps the counter looking neater.  This isn&#x27;t the easiest-to-use of bases, but I can indeed plug the F7 into it using just one hand.  Incidentally, the F5 also fits into this base, and the cords are interchangeable (kudos to Remington for that retro compatibility).  You probably shouldn&#x27;t store your shaver in the base, though (let it run down in between charges).  The battery is NiMH (same as the F5), which doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much of a problem as the old NiCad batteries with developing memory, but it does still have it to some extent.  Remington recommends that you fully discharge the battery every six months for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The F5 has a battery gauge consisting of a series of green lights.  The more that light up, the more power left in the battery (with corresponding markings next to the lights to indicate the percentage of battery left).  This F7 has a digital display that shows you approximately how many minutes of runtime you have left.  This could be handy, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably not terribly accurate (and will likely grow less accurate over time), so this isn&#x27;t much of a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The F5 has smooth plastic ribs where your thumb would rest when shaving to give you a good grip. In the same place, this F7 has rubbery nibs.  I find the F5 to be more comfortable and to provide perfectly adequate grip, but the F7 is definitely a more sure grip in case you shave under extreme circumstances and REALLY need to make sure you&#x27;ve got a tight grip on that sucker (bivouacking on a face of K2, maybe?).  I can&#x27;t even say that the F7 is more ergonomic and would be better for someone with impaired grip.  It&#x27;s just that if you have a death grip on each one, a bear could swat the F5 out of your hand a little more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The power button on the F5 seems a little easier to find instantly without looking due to it sticking out slightly more when sliding your thumb down from the aforementioned thumb-grip area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The F7 and F5 look identical from the back, and from the front the differences are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The F7 and the F5 take the same replacement screen (SPF300) and cutters, and everything about the head seems identical, so I would expect the shave to be identical, too.  To be honest, when I tried this F7, it did seem a little quicker, but that&#x27;s probably because the cutters on my F5 are about six months old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of electric shavers. I kind of collect them. I have several Remingtons, Brauns, and Panasonics.  The shaver I was using before I got my F5 was a pricey self-cleaning Braun. I was pretty happy with it, so I was surprised by how well the F5 (and now the F7) works. What a fast shave! A lot of shavers tend to miss hairs, and you have to go back over the same area several times to get them all. But the F5 and F7 really have \\&quot;bite.\\&quot;  They cut the hair rather than push it over, as some shavers tend to do in places, especially on longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because these Remingtons gets more hairs in fewer passes, the irritation level is virtually non-existent. This took me by surprise even more. A close and fast shave with no irritation? Count me in! My feature-laden Braun has been sitting idle ever since I got the F5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just a couple of drawbacks to Remingtons. One is that they are noticeably louder than my Braun, which is unusually quiet. But they are no noisier than you usually find with an electric shaver.  TheF7 sounds a bit different from the F5, maybe just a tiny bit quieter, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real drawback of Remingtons is that their screens (like every Remington I&#x27;ve ever tried), subtly blacken your skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed it? Run a cotton ball soaked in toner (or a Stridex pad...hey, they&#x27;re great even for adult skin) over your beard area after shaving, and you&#x27;ll see that the cotton ball has become distinctly gray. And this effect is worse in the summer, when your skin is likely to be moister due to humidity or heat. Don&#x27;t even THINK of using a Remington fresh out of the shower. And as the screen gets older, it leaves even more residue behind.  Fortunately, the heads on both the F5 and the F7 can be soaped up and rinsed off.  Doing this every couple of weeks will greatly minimize skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So which should you get?  The F5 is still my favorite because I prefer the more-comfortable thumb grip.  I do like the base that comes with the F7, but you&#x27;ll have to decide if that&#x27;s an important enough feature to pay the extra for the F7.  Both of these are fine shavers and are my top recommendations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement shaver for the one I&#x27;ve been using the past 10 years and I think the Remington F7-7800 is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a digital display that tells me the amount of time left in the charge and it shows when it&#x27;s charging. I recently tested a different shaver and there were NO lights telling you when it charged and I prefer how the Remington F7-7800 tells me I&#x27;m doing this, instead of making me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact you can either charge it in it&#x27;s stand or plug in the power cord directly to the shaver or you can do a 5 minute quick charge if the battery is down &amp; you&#x27;ll have enough power to do your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the 24 hour first charge when it arrived here yesterday and the digital read-out told me I have 60 minutes of shave time on my new shaver. After finishing the complete shaving of my 5 day&#x27;s beard growth, it tells me I still have 56 minutes left in the charge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be required to only have to plug this baby in once a month, at the most, to have this shaver ready to go for me anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a perfect, close and smooth shave without irritation, it&#x27;s a great shaver and I look forward to using it again after I have several days worth of beard growth, ready to dispense with on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the Remington F7-7800XCDN, I think I&#x27;ve found my permanent shaver, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this so far, for a quick shave but it doesn&#x27;t replace a non-electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is a really good, easy to use razor that does the job in short order.</li>
            <li> As of writing this review, the Amazon price for this Remington shaver is $58.79.  Based on my experience, I think that&#x27;s a solid deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll state outright that I am generally not a fan of electric shavers.  This is at least the third one I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a clean shave with any of them (although I guess this could be the result of faulty technique on my part).  So, while I wouldn&#x27;t say that this Remington is perfect, it does manage a nice close shave that, once finished, I can just clean up a little with my traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s rechargeable, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my normally sensitive skin.  I only used the shaver on wet skin with shaving lotion, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness on dry skin.  Probably my least favorite thing about electric shavers is cleaning them, but at least this one dissembles easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together not a bad shaver if you like the electronic gadgets, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay more than the current list price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Gillette Sensor kind of fellow, though I take a stab at electrics every few years.  My last couple of attempts have been with tri-coil electrics, which are supposedly closer and better shaves than a foil shaver like this, but both of those were downright terrible.  So with hesitant optimism I picked up the F7 to try: my first foil shaver in fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s good.  Let me say, not great, but pretty good.  The F7 not only cut closer than the tri-blades at half the cost, it was much easier on my skin.  Sure it took going over some spots more times than it should&#x27;ve, but I&#x27;ve now had several reasonable shaves without a single drop of blood or ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side, for this or any electric, is that despite all their claims to the contrary on the box marketing, it simply does not cut as close as a blade.  A shave from the F7 was decently good, but leaves what I call the \\&quot;noon shadow\\&quot;: you can&#x27;t see the beard but you sure can feel its slight stubble if you touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F7 comes with a charging base, or you can plug it in directly.  It lasts for 60 minutes on a charge, with an LED countdown on the front to tell you how much time is left (and it seemed to be pretty accurate).  The pop-out trimmer I have less praise for since it didn&#x27;t seem to trim or shave my hair at all when I tried to trim up my sideburns.  Overall it&#x27;s the best electric I&#x27;ve tried in years, despite its shortcomings, and is a good alternative to a blade-shave if I need to trim on the go.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a disposable razor for over 20 years, but has converted to an electric razor with this Remington product. It has a simple design which lends itself to being both easy to use and easy to clean. It provides a close shave and excellent trimmer.  Its performance is as good as the disposable razor with the added convenience of being able to power it through charging it as compared to regularly buying new razor heads for the disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard since I was 19 years old. That has been several decades at this point. For me, shavers need to be powerful, comfortable and precise in the way they cut facial hair. The Remington F7-7800XCDN Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver is a perfectly serviceable beard cutter. It doesn&#x27;t allow the maneuverability and detailing possible with a rotary shaver, but it mows the lawn quite well. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As foil shavers go, this one has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in my hand. A-lot of foil shavers tend to be short squat &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t fit well in the hand and require a contortionist&#x27;s flexibility to hold your head in the proper position to get to the beard. It is fairly light weight and well balanced. The F7-7800XCDN is fairly loud for an electric shaver but the vibration in the hand and on the face is perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to comfort, the shaver doesn&#x27;t pull and tear at the whiskers any worse than the other shavers I&#x27;ve used. When drawing the shaver across the face it doesn&#x27;t tend to snag whiskers in the way some razors do. With some shavers I&#x27;ve had, the blades tended to draw the skin into the cutting head to the point that it actually irritated the skin. There were times I ended up with large angry red patches on my neck. This shaver takes it reasonably easy and doesn&#x27;t produce that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F7-7800XCDN produces a shave that is as close as any shaver I&#x27;ve used to this point. In my experience NO electric shaver ever produces a truly close shave and I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen over the years, both rotary and foil. This one does a good job. It takes away the shaft completely above the skin. The stubble left at skin level are very short and not visible. When you run your hand along your neck you can feel them, but, as I said, that is par for all electric shavers on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the  Remington F7-7800XCDN is a good shaver for the money. With the exception of the noise level and a few other design flaws that don&#x27;t impact the quality of the shave, it gets the job done.r design flaws that don&#x27;t impact the quality of the shave, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I saw charge stand in the title so I thought that I would have to have the cord while shaving. This Works with or WITHOUT the cord. It holds a charge for a very long time (it does not have a travel case), and I like this razor much better than the last Remington. Another good thing is the digital battery indicator, which shows the battery level. Full Capacity is 20 minutes and there is a 5 minute quick charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks wise, its a bit bigger than other models. On sight, it looks kinda plasticky but the tilting head makes shaving around the corners of your face much easier and this feature is only available on the higher priced Braun shavers. Its also a bit louder than Braun, but the results are about even.In essence, it gives you a similar shave but Remington is overall noisier and bigger. If you don&#x27;t mind that, than this is a good midpriced option.</li>
            <li> I like the name of this, Interceptor.  It intercepts hair at the skin line.  I like to use this without the cord while in the shower and it works great when wet.  I use it on my legs and underarms and only one pass with it leaves my skin silky smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s shavers for a long time, as there is more variety and they often work better and give smoother shaves than women&#x27;s shavers usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This boasts that it costs less than other men&#x27;s shavers. Right now it&#x27;s around $70+ so I think it has gone up in price recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a great, super smooth shave.  What I particularly love about this is the amber LED that shows how much battery power is left before it needs recharging.  I leave this out on my dressing table, minus the cord, and use it every day on my legs before I go for my swim, and only need to return it to its charger about once a week.  It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a slightly larger shaving head than other shavers I&#x27;ve seen, which means it does the job faster.  Overall this is a very good shaver.  I tried it on dry skin and didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as on wet skin.  It dragged on the skin and pulled at the hair a bit.  On wet skin it glides smoothly and works much better.  I doubt if most men will dampen their faces before shaving with an electric shaver, but with this it would be a good idea, and even put some soap on the face, as I do with my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this charges in only 5 minutes overides the lack of elegance in the design.  Other men&#x27;s shavers need a few hours before they are charged up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit larger than most men&#x27;s shavers. I imagine this would work best for a man with larger hands.</li>
            <li> Good saver but not as well made as others. I have been using this shaver for about a month and works well for try shaving, but takes longer to get a good close shave as other similar shavers from other companies. The overall quality of this saver is not as high as the Panasonic or Braun shavers, but it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is the third electric shaver I have tried after decades of using nothing but blades. Having tried two previous models, I believe my face is suitably adjusted for electric shavers. What I&#x27;ve found is that all three are about the same. Each one, this one included, does an adequate job of removing visible whiskers. So if I wake up late, don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use a blade, and have to be at work quickly, I can use this to make myself presentable for a day of work. However, this shaver does not come as close to smooth as a blade does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, I have what I imagine are fairly tough whiskers, and it does take me two passes with a razor to get the job done. Still, I don&#x27;t find that this electric shaver comes close to the effect of a blade. That said, I do like its ability to do a job in a pinch, it&#x27;s easy to operate and charge, and I will keep it for those times when how I look is more important than how I feel.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well.  Good to travel with.</li>
            <li> As expected - has a nice floating head.</li>
            <li> This worked awesome on my husband. His face was so smooth after he used it. I was thrilled. He has had several electric razors over the years and this is the best one he&#x27;s ever used. In the past he&#x27;s used the rotary style shavers so this is the first of this style shaver. The battery lasts several weeks without needing a charge but also when you do need a charge, it charges very fast. The shave gets really close to the skin and this is by far the smoothest shave he&#x27;s had with an electric razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Its also quite easy to clean. Every day after using it he just run it under the faucet and once a week or so, just pop off the head and dump the shavings that it collected and brush it with the included brush to give it a good cleaning. There is also a pop up trimmer for side burns and/or mustaches. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with this razor. I don&#x27;t have to worry about him scraping up my face. He generally doesn&#x27;t shave during the weekend so come Monday morning I can&#x27;t wait to feel his face when he&#x27;s done shaving.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband. He doesn&#x27;t have a heavy beard so it&#x27;s nice to have something that he can just use in between razor shaves. It did get a pretty close shave, but he said it pulled some hairs out and drew a little blood. This seems to be a theme with foil razors, at least for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it&#x27;s nice that it shaves close and has either battery or plugged in, ultimately it&#x27;s not going to see a lot of use.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s F7 Interceptor shaver provides surprisingly good results as well a full complement of features that further impresses against it&#x27;s mid-range pricing. The device offers a reasonably close shave but more importantly does not leave the skin chaffed or irritated. Other things I liked with the F7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Can be used plugged or unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;2) There is a 5 minute quick-charge mode to get you started quickly if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;3) Battery has good performance and even has a digital &#x27;minutes left&#x27; indicator. Max capacity is listed at 60 minutes and the average shave for myself knocks it down 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4) Shaver is very easy to clean and can be rinsed under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;5) The charger stand is designed very well in that it remains stable even with the shaver plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;6) Physical design is masculine and minimalist. Not fussy and does not look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing really is a travel case but aside from that this is a simple, elegant product that fully delivers.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have had very disappointing results with the past two women’s razors that I have purchased.  They were just terrible.  I would get out of the shower and discover that I needed to shave part of my leg I missed.  How did I suddenly forget to shave?  Was it old age?  No, they didn’t work on the more curved part of my leg, or on the straight line in front.  So, not on curved, not on straight?  Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when I selected this one, it was because of its similarity in style to my last two razors that were both pink.  These were both Panasonic.  This B000G0GW6K is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good dry shaver, which I discovered when I used it before I ran out of the house with bare legs.  It didn’t hurt, but it also didn’t work.  However, it is much better than my Panasonic women’s razors.  My legs are clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that there is one women’s shaver that is the rotary style on this site. B000KKPBFO.  The reviews are all over though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just think that if they can make a razor that can make it over a man’s face, I bet they can make one that will shave my legs even better.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers have mixed results, at best, and this is no exception. It doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave at all, and tends to pull, which has caused some skin irritation (this has never been a problem for me with other shavers or with razors). Worse, after about a week, the shaver actually cut my face above the upper lip (surprisingly, a worse cut than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with any disposable razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions specify that it is, under absolutely no condition, be used wet or immersed in water, and the head is not removable, which combine to make cleaning a bit of a hassle. Stubble can only be removed by shaking and brushing it out, and, somehow, there always seems to be far less coming out than it seems like I actually removed from my face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have excellent battery life, and can be used if you&#x27;re in a rush, which are the only real positives I can think of. Otherwise I can&#x27;t recommend it; the purpose of an electric shaver, I thought, was to prevent cutting oneself.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son loves this Remington Men&#x27;s Interceptor Foil Shaver.  It&#x27;s fast and convenient for him.  He is pleasantly surprised with how close it shaves.  There is a learning curve involved when moving from a razor to an electric shaver, and he was ready to make the change.  For him, his hair is lighter and but thicker under his chin, and finds that this does the trick when getting the hair that seems to grow so much faster.  We stick with the Remington brand because we are never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Close shaving and quite powerful, The charging stand is a plus, this way it&#x27;s always in full power. A bit bulkier in size, but not heavy. Fair price, but original replacement Screen and cutter is a bit pricey. Very good over all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different Remington razors over the years, and this is the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The digital battery time remaining display is large and easy to read.  The display initially reads 60 min., but the shaver runs for several more minutes even after reaching zero.&lt;br /&gt;* The stand-up charger base is convenient.  It&#x27;s not really a charger itself, just has a pass through connection for the cord.&lt;br /&gt;* The pivoting head follows face contours well, better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s lighter and much quieter than my old Remington Titanium.&lt;br /&gt;* Most important, it gives a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* The pop-up trimmer is not as convenient to use as the Titanium&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;* No carrying case or pouch is included.  I&#x27;ve recycled an old one, but a semi-hard traveling case should at least be available as an add-on option.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Bought 2!</li>
            <li> Nice shaver at a great price! Only complaint I paid for overnight shipping and it did not meet the dead line</li>
            <li> The Remington F7-7800XCDN is a pretty good electric shaver, not the best, but it gets the job done.  It is lightweight, easy to use and charges quickly.  The motor&#x27;s fairly powerful and feels smooth.  Very few hairs get stuck and pull while shaving and it glides effortlessly along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s not water-proof, it does clean pretty easily and seems to handle water quite well with minor contact, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend cleaning it directly under a faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like an introductory electric shaver, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it just means that it&#x27;s not quite at the top of shavers.  However, it will get the job done right, just make sure to clean it fairly often, about once a week or so should do it.  If you&#x27;re looking to buy this, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.  I have used Panasonic shavers mostly but this is a very good one.  There is a quick charge feature that I like, since I often forget to charge my shaver when it gets low.  Running around in the morning in a hurry and having a dead shaver isn&#x27;t good.  5 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go.  It tilts like my Pannys and seems to have a decent close shave.  Like the Panasonics, you can wash it under the faucet.  This one is a bit bulky compared to my other and it just isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; as the Panasonic.  Overall, it is a good shaver though.</li>
            <li> First we&#x27;ll note the obvious positives.  It charges quickly for cordless use in an upright stand you can keep by the sink. And despite being electric you can wash it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We gave it to the 17 year old to test--his first electric.  He was shocked that it provides just as close a shave as a blade razor.  But he did have some trouble navigating his upper lip.  Whether that&#x27;s a function of the razor or the inexperience of the kid we&#x27;ll know in a few months....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not well-versed in different razors enough to be able to compare, but this razor does work extremely well, better than other razors I&#x27;ve previously owned, but that could just because the technology is getting better in all electric razors.</li>
            <li> The Remington F7 is a fairly straightforward shaver with twin foil cylinder type blades. It has only the one on/off button as well as a latch that, when released, flips out a simple stubble trimmer. The cap with the two foils can be pulled off to reveal the cylindrical blades which will have to be cleaned from time to time with the small double headed brush that’s provided for this purpose. Seperately in the box is a guard to protect the foils when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model has a small digital readout that blinks at you. The manual talks about five different models and recommends charging for a straight 24 hours before use. The digital read-out was a little confusing at first. It’s an orange/amber color and kept displaying 60 no matter how long I left it charging. I had assumed it would go higher or change color to green, or have some kind of indicator to tell you when it was full.  And then I realized that 60 means there is 60 minutes of running time left. When my husband started using it, it dropped to 57 after three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has sensitive skin and so occasionally he will go three to five days without shaving as most shavers irritate his skin.  Of course this means he also grows a somewhat coarse stubble. He actually made sure he had the “right kind” of stubble this time since I told him he had a new shaver. He has been using a Phillips stubble trimmer and three head shacer with trimmer, foil and twin rotary heads. And sometimes uses them all. He was expecting to not like this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, he was pleasantly surprised. It is quite large and probably not for small hands. The head pivots nicely to conform to his face as he used it. And it worked very well on most areas, even on his 1/8 inch stubble. It was only below the chin that it struggled a little and this is where the flip out trimmer comes into play. It flicks out at 90 degrees and is lightly sprung. We weren’t exactly sure how this was supposed to work at this angle. It almost looked dangerous. But the trick is in the sprung nature. He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring so it doesn’t snag or cause any discomfort. The foils took care of over 90 percent of his stubble and it was only some stray longer hairs that needed the extra attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it worked quickly and easily and the only minor complaint was that it was quite loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a power cord and a stand. You can charge the shaver directly with the cord, or via the stand (with the cord plugged into the stand). One nice thing compared to the Philips shaver he has been using is that he can use the shaver while the cord is plugged in. There have been a few times when the old Philips shaver would run out mid shave and he would have to dig out his wet shaver to finish the job. This will not be necessary here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s good to have the time indicator on the shaver to display how long he has left. Our bathroom doesn’t have much shelf or storage space. With the electric toothbrush there is no room for a shaver to be permenantly plugged in. So the charge time will be useful in that he will know when to plug it in. A full charge should last 60 minutes. At least while the batteries are still quite fresh and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it’s a nice shaver. It looks ok, though the plastic feels a little cheap. It works well, and though loud it’s not so loud as to be irritating. Just don’t expect to chat with someone in the next room and be able to carry a conversation. And best of all, it doesn’t irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you’re looking for a good shaver for someone with sensitive skin, you should give this one a try.o work at this angle. It almost looked dangerous. But the trick is in the sprung nature. He just dragged it slowly and gently and the blade worked like a trailing arm suspension with the light force of the spring so it doesn’t snag or cause any discomfort.

            <li> I really like this shaver, I know it&#x27;s geared towards men but I&#x27;m a woman and use it for my legs..... Oh well...It works great and I get a nice smooth look with no nicks or cuts. It charges up quickly and actually holds a long lasting charge. You can use this with or without the cord. very versatile. I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 17 year old son.  He&#x27;s been using disposable razor blades to shave, and I thought it might be nice for him to have something nice.  Plus, if it doesn&#x27;t work out for him, there&#x27;s the 15 year old, or I can box it up for the younger boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad and my brothers all used shavers similar to this one.  My husband always used (he has a beard now) a decent blade, but I never thought to ask him why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I love that you can use it with or without the cord.&lt;br /&gt;2) I love that there aren&#x27;t a million settings or switches.  On.  Off.&lt;br /&gt;3) It looks big, but fits either of my older sons&#x27; hands fine.  I&#x27;m not the one using it, so it feeling clunky in my hands doesn&#x27;t really matter, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;4) It works just fine to leave it on the charging stand, as it is fairly stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m trying to figure out if the young man just needs more practice with it.  He feels that he goes back and forth over an area and it does nothing.  That&#x27;s when his dad chimed in.  \\&quot;I never could use electric razors either, and I always assumed that it is because my stubble is just too fine.  I think they are better for people with coarser hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, then.  I guess I should have asked more questions about hubby&#x27;s shaving habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is continuing to use it, as he does seem to like it more than the blades.  When I stood with him in the bathroom, and talked him through some things, it did work out much better.  He just needs some practice.  And we&#x27;ll bring it along next time we visit my dad, and get grandpa to give some shaving lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line:  I think this is a nice shaver, even if my family tends to do better with razor blades.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new shaver for a gift!  The shaving end contours nicely as it moves across your face and it seems to shave well.  Having been a long-time owner of Remington shavers I felt like this one did an excellent job shaving.  Where it falls down is the trimmer!  My old Remington model had an excellent trimmer to do side burns, etc.  The trimmer on this model is long and very narrow! It also juts out from the back at a right angle making it difficult to use successfully!  It simply trims very poorly.  For that reason I only rate this an average shaver.</li>
            <li> Needed to buy electric razor because of taking blood thinners. I wasn&#x27;t exactly disappointed because I never liked same. They take too long to shave and this one does also. Shave is acceptable.</li>
