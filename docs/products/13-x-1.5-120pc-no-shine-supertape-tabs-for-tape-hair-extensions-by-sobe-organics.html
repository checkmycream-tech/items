            <li>Very quick shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>I opted to pay more for this product because it was advertised as &amp;#34;no shine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ordered these and didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 6 days so that they would hold better.</li>
            <li>Works better than most hair tapes iv used.</li>
            <li>I took very good care of the hair, always waited 48 hours after putting new tape in, giving them time to seal, and I always used the right kind of shampoo (no conditioner) in order to prevent the extensions from coming out, I did everything right</li>
            <li>they are easy to use .  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>product worked wonderfully way better than the stuff at sallys id definitely be buying this product again very soon</li>
            <li>Most of them feel out within the first week after putting them in.</li>
            <li>The brand seemed convincing enough, &amp; the quantity was amazing-</li>
            <li>And is pretty easy to apply and remove the backing.</li>
            <li>Within a week, most of my extentions had either slipped or fallen out completely.  </li>
            <li>Slides right out, doesn&#x27;t stick..</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t spend your money on something that doesn&#x27;t grip your hair right.</li>
            <li>I usually use the babe hair extension tape, which I was always happy with.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be using them again in the future.</li>
            <li>The tape seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Half the price of the sobe and SO much better!</li>
            <li>They held very well.</li>
            <li>This tape worked really well with the bulk hair.</li>
            <li>If you are using original tape in wefts, it may last longer.</li>
            <li>They fill firmly fitted to my hair, but very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to brush my hair like I was with the sobe tape, knowing that if I brushed and my hair was tangled I would pull a couple extension out.</li>
            <li>I am so upset that I spent so much money on these!!!</li>
            <li>Ive only used them as an emergency fix before I could get back to the salon, but they were easy to apply and stayed affixed to the extensions.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It kinda rips the natural hair out.</li>
            <li>The longest I was able to keep some of the extensions in (this was only a few of them)</li>
            <li>Washed them today for the first time and they are all slipping out.</li>
            <li>I have had maaaaany different types of hair extensions and just like to try new ones</li>
            <li>No only was the product extremely shinny, they were double the cost of the other Sobe Tapes on Amazon (which was most likely the same product).  </li>

            <li> These worked well.  Ive only used them as an emergency fix before I could get back to the salon, but they were easy to apply and stayed affixed to the extensions.</li>
            <li> product worked wonderfully way better than the stuff at sallys id definitely be buying this product again very soon dont think ill ever use another brand</li>
            <li> I opted to pay more for this product because it was advertised as &amp;#34;no shine&amp;#34;. No only was the product extremely shinny, they were double the cost of the other Sobe Tapes on Amazon (which was most likely the same product).  After using the tapes, I found they did not hold well.  Within a week, most of my extentions had either slipped or fallen out completely.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used my own weft. The tape did last for four weeks. I did expect it to last longer.  If you are using original tape in wefts, it may last longer.</li>
            <li> Tape works great. Used it on re-install of tape in extensions. Used flat iron on LOW setting during installation 2 weeks ago no slippage!</li>
            <li> The hair tape worked great they are easy to use .  I will for sure be using them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy that product it sucks big time. Tape will not hold extension in hair. I&#x27;m sorry I got it.</li>
            <li> Slides right out, doesn&#x27;t stick.. I constantly had to replace pieces when I used this tape. Not very good at all</li>
            <li> The brand seemed convincing enough, &amp; the quantity was amazing- but wouldn&#x27;t you give away a lot of your product too if it didn&#x27;t work too well?! These tapes are garbageeeee. I&#x27;ve done tape in extensions for years. These don&#x27;t stick- and are so tiny. Trust- don&#x27;t spend your money on something that doesn&#x27;t grip your hair right.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> Much less than the cost in stores!! Works the same!</li>
            <li> These tape tabs are great they stay and stay and stay , kinda like the battery bunny! They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> The tapes came out each time I washed my hair. I tried using Sally&#x27;s &amp;#34;men&#x27;s hair tape&amp;#34; instead...I went on a 7 day beach vacation and was in the water daily and they didn&#x27;t come out. These came out in just a regular shower, even being careful. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> The tape seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stick to the extension or my hair:( disap</li>
            <li> I usually use the babe hair extension tape, which I was always happy with. But recently moved out of state were I no longer could get them. I went to amazon and found the Sobe hair tape, ordered them hoping they would work, but I was wrong. I constantly had problems keeping them in. Every time I would wash my hair I would 3-4 extensions due to the tape slipping. The longest I was able to keep some of the extensions in (this was only a few of them) was 2 weeks. Most of them feel out within the first week after putting them in. I took very good care of the hair, always waited 48 hours after putting new tape in, giving them time to seal, and I always used the right kind of shampoo (no conditioner) in order to prevent the extensions from coming out, I did everything right and no matter what I did I could not get them to stay in. I would not recommend these to anyone! Do not waste your money. I recently order different tape \\&quot;Walker hair tape\\&quot; and since having them I&#x27;ve washed my hair 4 times and have not lost one extention. They fill firmly fitted to my hair, but very comfortable. I&#x27;m not afraid to brush my hair like I was with the sobe tape, knowing that if I brushed and my hair was tangled I would pull a couple extension out. The walker hair tape came with 120pcs, same size as sobe and cost me $10.50 TOTAL including shipping! Half the price of the sobe and SO much better! I would recommend the walker tape to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have had maaaaany different types of hair extensions and just like to try new ones so I can find the absolute best for myself and my clients. I ordered these and didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 6 days so that they would hold better. Washed them today for the first time and they are all slipping out. I am a licensed cosmetologist and am trained in tape extensions, and I have NEVER had this issues. My tape ins usually last 6 weeks. I am so upset that I spent so much money on these!!!</li>
            <li> They held very well. As good as any salon tape tab. Will continue to buy and use this product. It saved me money.</li>
            <li> Works great. Perfect for Bebe extensions. Works better than most hair tapes iv used. Good price. Arrived in 2 days. Good size.</li>
            <li> This tape worked really well with the bulk hair. And is pretty easy to apply and remove the backing. It is a bit hard to get out of the hair though after you&#x27;ve applied it. It kinda rips the natural hair out.</li>
