            <li>i say more  ?</li>
            <li>One of the beauties about Polo Sport is the versatility or flexibility - perhaps tailored more for Spring and Summer, I feel confident the fragrance can be worn any time of year and for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there may be better fragrances out there -</li>
            <li>Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies).  </li>

            <li>Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies).  </li>
            <li>I love the sporty scent.</li>
            <li>The perfume is ok, but The top of the bottle doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>and I love the Ralph Lauren Polo Sport smell.</li>
            <li>This is our son&#x27;s favorite Cologne.  </li>
            <li>Look up this seller (Tuccini)on the Better Business Bureau website.</li>
            <li>This should be available every where!</li>
            <li>and it is a good go to fragrance when the price is right.</li>
            <li>Sporty, cool, refreshing and relaxing!</li>
            <li>scent, manly, not musky at all, not over powering, no fruity type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;a very clean and sporty smell.</li>
            <li>Very clean smell and is timeless.</li>
            <li>Good price, shipped fast, product as promised....would buy again!</li>
            <li>Pretty good cologne but its a bit too musky for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any stores except on special order, and even then, it would have taken longer to arrive and cost more.</li>
            <li>Very sweet scent but not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fresh scent without too much citrus.</li>
            <li>manly, preppy, but not too strong or musky.</li>
            <li>I have always loved RL Polo Sport since high school.</li>
            <li>That said, the packaging is average at best.  </li>
            <li>It looks just fine, in the box and everything, but the smell...</li>
            <li>Found it here at Amazon and, as usual, they had a good price and great service.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>Classic good clean smell.</li>
            <li>i always love the fresh smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>Each are great fragrances, but very much different than this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo</li>
            <li>its very very worth the penny.</li>
            <li>but well worth the smile on his face on Christmas Morning!!</li>
            <li>my wife, however, doesn&#x27;t prefer the original Polo scent, so I haven&#x27;t warn that for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I paid a bit of a premium to get this before Christmas</li>
            <li>Si,ply can not say enough good about it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too sweet, it&#x27;s not too woody, or citric</li>
            <li>Came in as was supposed to......got it fast was able to wrap</li>
            <li>so glad I found it and at a decent price as well.</li>
            <li>I personally like this best in warmer months, and the traditional Polo in colder seasons (</li>
            <li>One of the classic fragrance designers, Ralph Lauren, has produced a number of scents we have grown to love.  </li>
            <li>Product, I always get this particular one since I am allergic to many things and this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>it went away quickly for some reason, despite 4-5 sprays.</li>
            <li>Smells musty and scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I cant return it since i live in another country and the shipping will cost more than what i payed for which was $35 or so.</li>
            <li>Received a lot of compliments and the size is perfect and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>A classic scent that is just so darn CLEAN!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit costly but worth it in my view.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time if do recall that I have ordered this kind of perfume .</li>
            <li>It also can be a favorite for all ages - those of us who grew up with Polo Sport and the younger audience who want to feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A classic scent that is breathes clean, fresh, and distinguished.  </li>
            <li>I thought the value I received was great and it came in time for christmas as a last minute present add in.</li>
            <li>it{s really good,, the frangance is soft, but last for hours.</li>
            <li>I like it very much considering the price and smell .</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, to give this a good review, it does have one little flaw.</li>
            <li>very strong smell, would last for the whole day...</li>
            <li>I tried a spirt and it just brought back so many memories..</li>
            <li>They say they only sell 100% authentic..</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just perfect balance of first, second, mid, and lasting smells.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t buy it, because I need to buy some more later.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>He loved using it everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo hard to find this thanks!!!!!!</li>
            <li>A classic scent that should be a part of every man&#x27;s collection; timeless fragrance that elicits sensations of a fresh spring/summer day anytime of year.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my youngest son&#x27;s first &#x27;real&#x27; cologne...</li>
            <li>bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren..</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) -</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and will  buy again.</li>
            <li>This is the real Polo Sport, not a knock off, but about 1/2 the price of a dept. store.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, but bottle cap was broken on arrival.  </li>
            <li>and I still really like it.</li>
            <li>Product just as described, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Does not have the citrus smell that the real one has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this fragrance since it was first promoted in the very early 1990s.</li>
            <li>or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term &#x27;loosely&#x27;..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo</li>

            <li>Bought it for the first time in the early 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>When purchsing such things as cologne you can be sure you are getting original quality products and not cheap rip-offs.  </li>
            <li>A must have, classic Polo Sport Parfum</li>
            <li>I highly recommend adding to your collection -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend adding to your collection -</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li>The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it&#x27;s fresh and clean wake, the potential is there.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find and kind of pricey</li>
            <li>Will have to make a stockpile as I am sure it wont last long.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without a bottle on my dresser and</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and have worn it in the past.</li>
            <li>They are extremely shady, sent me two tracking numbers one which i think was sent in error and revealed some interesting information.</li>
            <li>expensive, true, but should be used as a great everyday men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li>The only continuing problem I have with Amazon.com is in their pacakaging - they are very stingy with their bubble wrap, often leaving an item plenty to room to knock around in the box and sustain damage.  </li>
            <li>I used this cologne when I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li>but after a few uses the spray top came off and when tried to put back on it still would not work.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t lose your money, the fragrance dessapirece after a few minutes of use and don&#x27;t even smell like the original one.</li>
            <li>I have ordered with 3 different carriers of this cologne thinking mayb it was just one bottle, but sadly it wasnt, and the amazing scent doesnt last as long as I would like, 4 strong stars.</li>
            <li>Though i live in the same state they do business in item took weeks and weeks to be shipped.</li>
            <li>While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage.  </li>
            <li>always liked Polo sport and got it in a hurry and priced right.the bottle will last for some time and I will not get bored with the smell.</li>
            <li>even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy.  </li>

            <li> I thought the value I received was great and it came in time for christmas as a last minute present add in.</li>
            <li> it{s really good,, the frangance is soft, but last for hours.</li>
            <li> I like it very much considering the price and smell .</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, to give this a good review, it does have one little flaw.</li>
            <li> very strong smell, would last for the whole day...</li>
            <li> I tried a spirt and it just brought back so many memories..</li>
            <li> They say they only sell 100% authentic..</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just perfect balance of first, second, mid, and lasting smells.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t buy it, because I need to buy some more later.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> He loved using it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soo hard to find this thanks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A classic scent that should be a part of every man&#x27;s collection; timeless fragrance that elicits sensations of a fresh spring/summer day anytime of year.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my youngest son&#x27;s first &#x27;real&#x27; cologne...</li>
            <li> bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren..</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) -</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and will  buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the real Polo Sport, not a knock off, but about 1/2 the price of a dept. store.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, but bottle cap was broken on arrival.  </li>
            <li> and I still really like it.</li>
            <li> Product just as described, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Does not have the citrus smell that the real one has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance since it was first promoted in the very early 1990s.</li>
            <li> or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term &#x27;loosely&#x27;..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo</li>

            <li> When purchsing such things as cologne you can be sure you are getting original quality products and not cheap rip-offs.  </li>
            <li> A must have, classic Polo Sport Parfum</li>
            <li> I highly recommend adding to your collection -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend adding to your collection -</li>
            <li> I would recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li> The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it&#x27;s fresh and clean wake, the potential is there.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find and kind of pricey</li>
            <li> Will have to make a stockpile as I am sure it wont last long.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without a bottle on my dresser and</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have worn it in the past.</li>
            <li> They are extremely shady, sent me two tracking numbers one which i think was sent in error and revealed some interesting information.</li>
            <li> expensive, true, but should be used as a great everyday men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> The only continuing problem I have with Amazon.com is in their pacakaging - they are very stingy with their bubble wrap, often leaving an item plenty to room to knock around in the box and sustain damage.  </li>
            <li> I used this cologne when I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses the spray top came off and when tried to put back on it still would not work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t lose your money, the fragrance dessapirece after a few minutes of use and don&#x27;t even smell like the original one.</li>
            <li> I have ordered with 3 different carriers of this cologne thinking mayb it was just one bottle, but sadly it wasnt, and the amazing scent doesnt last as long as I would like, 4 strong stars.</li>
            <li> Though i live in the same state they do business in item took weeks and weeks to be shipped.</li>
            <li> While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage.  </li>
            <li> always liked Polo sport and got it in a hurry and priced right.the bottle will last for some time and I will not get bored with the smell.</li>
            <li> even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy.  </li>

            <li> Only gripe is scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and i noticed that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long and somehow the smell changes a bit.</li>
            <li> one of my favorites of lasting long</li>
            <li> Ive done some &amp;#34;tests&amp;#34; on how long the cologne&#x27;s smell actually lasts and i had a feeling</li>
            <li> The smell doesnt last that long mayb 2 hours max.</li>
            <li> I, generally, am not a &amp;#34;conspiracy theory&amp;#34; type of guy, but I have pondered the thought of authenticity of this purchase.  </li>
            <li> There have been comparisons to younger siblings, &amp;#34;Red, White, and Blue&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Polo Blue Sport&amp;#34; - I am not sure I get those same notes.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as is still convenient.l</li>
            <li> because usually when u buy new perfumes/colognes it is packed in box and the box is also packed in fitted plastic).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Lacoste, Burberry, CK, Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Bvlgari, and tons of other brands, but I keep coming back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never met a single person who didn&#x27;t think favorably about this scent.</li>
            <li> ill be back to buy, came right home and ordered from amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne approximately 10 years ago, and the smell is still exactly as I remembered...</li>
            <li> Previous order of Ralph Lauren Blue Sport arrived in a box with sealed plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> The Sport brand is harder to find</li>
            <li> simply put if you are looking for a cologne to wear everyday that is not over powering this is it.</li>
            <li> Other stuff makes him break out.</li>
            <li> Also, in the past the spray cap on the bottle has always been a silver/chrome color, but this bottle has a blue plastic cap.  </li>

            <li> With the spray you get just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I prefer something a little lighter</li>
            <li> I think not original.</li>
            <li> I hate this cheap smell of this one i bought from them.</li>
            <li> I use it at work everyday</li>
            <li> My son who is in HS wears this everyday and gets lots of compliments.</li>

            <li> I guess i was wrong</li>
            <li> but they are wrong.  </li>
            <li> They claim they dont sell knock offs and even include a guarantee against knock offs indicating you get a refund if you feel the item is a fake.</li>
            <li> Nostalgic scent!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe me this product is a FAKE, then call Ralph Lauren customer service yourself!</li>
            <li> Bad choice.</li>
            <li> , when i found out i wanted to kill her since i know it will be bad too.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that some of these fragrances have run their course and &amp;#34;put out to pasture&amp;#34; - so to speak.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got this for my husband. The Sport brand is harder to find so glad I found it and at a decent price as well. I&#x27;ve seen it cost less but this was not the most expensive either.</li>
            <li> well - i had used this for about 6 years.. and then switched to nautica latitude longitude as my girlfriend didnt know guy code (stick to the same colgone) and bought me it.&lt;br /&gt;i was obligated to use it than!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After they stopped making Nautica L L, i was in Macys and saw they still made Polo Sport. I tried a spirt and it just brought back so many memories..&lt;br /&gt;I said SURE.. ill be back to buy, came right home and ordered from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great scent, manly, not musky at all, not over powering, no fruity type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;a very clean and sporty smell. goes with any occasion.</li>
            <li> i Bought the polo sport perfume from AAA merchants. Bad choice. It looks just fine, in the box and everything, but the smell... ughhh. I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragance for many years because i like it a lot but i decided to buy it through them online. The fragance doesnt last and it doesnt quite smell the same. I hate this cheap smell of this one i bought from them. They say they only sell 100% authentic.. blah blah heyyy i know what im saying!! I cant return it since i live in another country and the shipping will cost more than what i payed for which was $35 or so. My girlfriend just purchased a Kenzo amour from AAA menrchants just recently, when i found out i wanted to kill her since i know it will be bad too.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance... been using it for years now. very strong smell, would last for the whole day...</li>
            <li> People need to think of Amazon.com for the purchase of everything, to include the proverbial &#x27;kitchen sink.&#x27;  Those who shop the internet will be surprised how often Amazon.com does have the best value for the money.  When purchsing such things as cologne you can be sure you are getting original quality products and not cheap rip-offs.  This item was purchased as a gift for someone who has used Polo Sport cologne for years and he was extremely satisfied.  The only continuing problem I have with Amazon.com is in their pacakaging - they are very stingy with their bubble wrap, often leaving an item plenty to room to knock around in the box and sustain damage.  The offset is that returns are accepted without question.</li>
            <li> I like it. So i use it always. Shipping was fast and will  buy again.</li>
            <li> product works as described</li>
            <li> outer box a little dirty....but the contents were A  OK.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I ofund out this colongne was being discontinued.  Found it here at Amazon and, as usual, they had a good price and great service.  Will have to make a stockpile as I am sure it wont last long.    Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best price and free 2-day shipping with prime.</li>
            <li> Been giving this to my grandson for 15 years, every Christmas.  His favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been used for 22 year of this product hope they are  continue to make this</li>
            <li> Fake Ralph Lauren Polo Sport edt&lt;br /&gt;I can scratch off the logo on the side of the bottle with my fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;scent lasts about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this cologne for my husband. It&#x27;s my favorite scent on him. The scent that gets things going...if you catch my drift.:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance since it was first promoted in the very early 1990s. I&#x27;ve never met a single person who didn&#x27;t think favorably about this scent. I personally like this best in warmer months, and the traditional Polo in colder seasons (my wife, however, doesn&#x27;t prefer the original Polo scent, so I haven&#x27;t warn that for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular spray package is very attractive and performs fabulously. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought the value I received was great and it came in time for christmas as a last minute present add in.</li>
            <li> 100% fake, this is a scam... Don&#x27;t lose your money, the fragrance dessapirece after a few minutes of use and don&#x27;t even smell like the original one.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this eau de toilette.  I have been buying it for him for years.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009OAGWE Polo Sport By Ralph Lauren For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces]]    I BOUGHT 1 EACH FOR MY SONS, AND THEY LOVED IT,</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite cologne of my husband that&#x27;s why i bought this one for him. i always love the fresh smell of this cologne. i received this in time and was packed properly. the only thing i noticed was the box was not packed in plastic (because usually when u buy new perfumes/colognes it is packed in box and the box is also packed in fitted plastic). and i noticed that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long and somehow the smell changes a bit.</li>
            <li> Been ysing it for years and my lady loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing my husband can wear. Other stuff makes him break out. I love the scent. I just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Polo Sport has been a favorite of mine for years. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great, exactly as I suspected.</li>
            <li> I love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good price, shipped fast, product as promised....would buy again!</li>
            <li> Its fake!!! The smell doesn&#x27;t last long and it smell  s terrible not like the original smells really good. Iam so disapointed i thaught amazon sells never sells fake items. I guess i was wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soo hard to find this thanks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great Cologne. Very clean smell and is timeless. Bought it for the first time in the early 90&#x27;s and it is a good go to fragrance when the price is right.</li>
            <li> Ordered a bottle of Polo Sport, the seller is Amazon.com LLC.  The bottle arrived in a real-looking cardboard box but there was no plastic wrapping - the box was essentially &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;. Also, in the past the spray cap on the bottle has always been a silver/chrome color, but this bottle has a blue plastic cap.  Previous order of Ralph Lauren Blue Sport arrived in a box with sealed plastic wrap.  I clicked on the &amp;#34;return item&amp;#34; link to send it back but it is listed as a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; and cannot be returned to the seller.  Should I be concerned or not?</li>
            <li> Nostalgic scent! Reminded me of my highs school days! Only gripe is scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It has been one of my favorites for years and i&#x27;m glad to get it. it&#x27;s a bit costly but worth it in my view.</li>
            <li> This is a very light smell. It travels with ou not twenty before and after you. With the spray you get just a little bit. Si,ply can not say enough good about it</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that my husband likes a lot. It was a present for him on father&#x27;s day. He was very pleased, so was I.</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> Smells great, awesome value and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> arrived in time.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever! I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any stores except on special order, and even then, it would have taken longer to arrive and cost more. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne approximately 10 years ago, and the smell is still exactly as I remembered...Sporty, cool, refreshing and relaxing!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>
            <li> A must have, classic Polo Sport Parfum</li>
            <li> While I like this product, I do find that everytime i order it, the price is up 10 dollars, now if my pay were to rise like that i would not be writing this review-----------need i say more  ?</li>
            <li> this item was good but after a few uses the spray top came off and when tried to put back on it still would not work.</li>
            <li> loved the smell on my husband.</li>
            <li> excellent product, no problem</li>
            <li> A classic scent that should be a part of every man&#x27;s collection; timeless fragrance that elicits sensations of a fresh spring/summer day anytime of year. I love this cologne!</li>
            <li> manly, preppy, but not too strong or musky. expensive, true, but should be used as a great everyday men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> Pretty good cologne but its a bit too musky for me. I prefer something a little lighter</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> one of my favorites of lasting long</li>
            <li> One of the classic fragrance designers, Ralph Lauren, has produced a number of scents we have grown to love.  It is too bad that some of these fragrances have run their course and &amp;#34;put out to pasture&amp;#34; - so to speak.  Polo Sport is one of these fragrances that became a classic, but with time, has become increasingly hard to find.  Perhaps it, too, has been discontinued.  I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) - I remember this time period fondly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle Polo Sport presents a complexity of notes, but settles into simplicity of citrus, fruity, and &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes.  A classic scent that is breathes clean, fresh, and distinguished.  Well done, Mr. Lauren..!!  While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage.  There have been comparisons to younger siblings, &amp;#34;Red, White, and Blue&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Polo Blue Sport&amp;#34; - I am not sure I get those same notes.  Each are great fragrances, but very much different than this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo Sport has plenty of &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; (compliments from the opposite sex) potential.  The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it&#x27;s fresh and clean wake, the potential is there.  One of the beauties about Polo Sport is the versatility or flexibility - perhaps tailored more for Spring and Summer, I feel confident the fragrance can be worn any time of year and for any occasion.  It also can be a favorite for all ages - those of us who grew up with Polo Sport and the younger audience who want to feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren.. As mentioned, I purchased this online.  That said, the packaging is average at best.  I, generally, am not a &amp;#34;conspiracy theory&amp;#34; type of guy, but I have pondered the thought of authenticity of this purchase.  (I will add the purchase was through a very reputable source..) Regardless, the packaging is average or modest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the purchase, Polo Sport can still be found moderately priced.  My final tally of Polo Sport is 4.3 stars out of 5.  Yes, there may be better fragrances out there - even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy.  I highly recommend adding to your collection - or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term &#x27;loosely&#x27;..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo Sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies).

            <li> Great scent from 1996 when I wore it in highschool before I had any idea about fragrances.  Would I wear it today, heck no.</li>
            <li> so lets put it this way. I havent had one complaint from any woman out their about this cologne. its very very worth the penny.</li>
            <li> I love the sporty scent.I bought it as a gift for my husband.He loved using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo Sport. Will continue to buy as long as is still convenient.l</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I paid a bit of a premium to get this before Christmas but it&#x27;s my youngest son&#x27;s first &#x27;real&#x27; cologne...</li>
            <li> Very good product for the money.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, fast ship.</li>
            <li> I always liked polo sport when I used to go to school.  I heard it was discontinued in stores then I found out it was sold on Amazon.  Some of the reviews said it was a fake imitation but they are wrong.  I use it at work everyday and it&#x27;s smells great.  Received a lot of compliments and the size is perfect and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> always liked Polo sport and got it in a hurry and priced right.the bottle will last for some time and I will not get bored with the smell.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto excelente</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The perfume is ok, but The top of the bottle doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t have the box, this is the reason I can&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I love this cologne. I have for 10+ years</li>
            <li> it{s really good,, the frangance is soft, but last for hours.</li>
            <li> This is the real Polo Sport, not a knock off, but about 1/2 the price of a dept. store. My son who is in HS wears this everyday and gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, but bottle cap was broken on arrival.  Still produces great fragrance and I love the Ralph Lauren Polo Sport smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this forever. I&#x27;ve tried Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Lacoste, Burberry, CK, Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Bvlgari, and tons of other brands, but I keep coming back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too sweet, it&#x27;s not too woody, or citric, it&#x27;s just perfect balance of first, second, mid, and lasting smells.  I would recommend this highly.  But don&#x27;t buy it, because I need to buy some more later.</li>
            <li> Came in as was supposed to......got it fast was able to wrap</li>
            <li> I used this cologne when I was 19 years old. I haven&#x27;t used it now for over a decade. I just gave it another try and I still really like it. It&#x27;s a great fresh scent without too much citrus.</li>
            <li> Product just as described, and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake so I tried to cancel it by logging into amazon.com.  I noticed the status was preparing the product for shipment.  I selected cancel and show message saying will review and let you know.  Immediately, in about five mins I got a email saying we can&#x27;t cancel it since it is shipped.  I then logged back into amazon and noticed the status now says shipped.  I think this was bit unfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Product, I always get this particular one since I am allergic to many things and this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> smells yummy! I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> simply put if you are looking for a cologne to wear everyday that is not over powering this is it.</li>
            <li> A classic scent that is just so darn CLEAN! I can&#x27;t live without a bottle on my dresser and neither should any other self respecting MAN.</li>
            <li> This is our son&#x27;s favorite Cologne.  It is hard to find and kind of pricey but well worth the smile on his face on Christmas Morning!!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have worn it in the past. Purchased it from Tuccini here on Amazon and it was a nightmare experience. They claim they dont sell knock offs and even include a guarantee against knock offs indicating you get a refund if you feel the item is a fake. Well it was, i could take a bath in the stuff and the smell would last a very short time. Might as well sell me a bottle of water. I contacted the seller, they are rude and refused me a refund AFTER they told me to ship them the item which i had to pay to ship it to them. So they had the item and my money and were not returning my emails. I had to get Amazon involved and even then i had to fight to get my money back. They are extremely shady, sent me two tracking numbers one which i think was sent in error and revealed some interesting information. Though i live in the same state they do business in item took weeks and weeks to be shipped. Look up this seller (Tuccini)on the Better Business Bureau website. I wish i had because I would NEVER have purchased from them. This nightmare dragged on for weeks, you have been warned.</li>
            <li> I have always loved RL Polo Sport since high school. Very sweet scent but not too strong. A few sprays will last the whole day.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find Ralp Lauren Polo Sport it in our place. I like it very much considering the price and smell . This is my 3rd time if do recall that I have ordered this kind of perfume . Thank you !</li>
            <li> Now ive been using polo sport for a while now and keep on using it because of its flawless smell. HOWEVER, to give this a good review, it does have one little flaw. Ive done some &amp;#34;tests&amp;#34; on how long the cologne&#x27;s smell actually lasts and i had a feeling it went away quickly for some reason, despite 4-5 sprays. The smell doesnt last that long mayb 2 hours max. I have ordered with 3 different carriers of this cologne thinking mayb it was just one bottle, but sadly it wasnt, and the amazing scent doesnt last as long as I would like, 4 strong stars.</li>
            <li> I think not original.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!! Been searching for this cologne for a while now... can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> This should be available every where! Classic good clean smell. Arrived quickly and safely. VERY satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is a KNOCKOFF!! Smells musty and scent fades quickly. Does not have the citrus smell that the real one has. Don&#x27;t believe me this product is a FAKE, then call Ralph Lauren customer service yourself! They will confirm they DO NOT sell ANY PRODUCTS ON AMAZON: Tel 888-475-7674</li>
