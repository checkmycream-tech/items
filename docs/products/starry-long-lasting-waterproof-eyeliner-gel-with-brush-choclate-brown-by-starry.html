    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was originally impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the lookout for the perfect eyeliner</li>
            <li>It is a very good Amout and everything</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product...</li>
            <li>and this is a really good quality product for the price...</li>
            <li>The applicator brush would be perfect with the right product, but the product itself is what I would describe as grainy.  </li>
            <li>On the one hand, it has a beautiful texture and glides on smoothly, making application a breeze.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that it stayed on all day with no problems and because of its rich color, it was easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li>This stuff stays put all day and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>So far, so great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING :)  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many...</li>
            <li>I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel eyeliner!I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The color is rich and honestly I prefer using this to the Bobbi Brown gel I used to use.   </li>
            <li>My lines come out perfect and the fact that I have complete control of the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; AND to choose how much or little liner i want to put on my eyes is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>The brush is pretty good, you just have to wash it every now and again.</li>
            <li>I love how easily</li>
            <li>but with this one I get it done the first time and real quick too!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the chocolate brown, which is quite dark and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li>but over all not bad :)</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I put some on in the morning and rarely think about make up again unless I am going out in the evening.    </li>
            <li>It was worth a try for the price</li>
            <li>The first day, I used it without a primer</li>
            <li>On the plus side, I just can&#x27;t say enough about how versatile and smooth this liner is!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;wand\\&quot; pokes the hell out of your eyelid, but it really does a bang up job!</li>
            <li>and I use a range of products from super high end to drug store quality ...</li>
            <li>and it smudged so much I had</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much easier than liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to leave the house, it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>I love the dark brown color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite black - it&#x27;s more of a brown color.</li>
            <li>I still use it if you use primer Like urban decay primer potion it doest stay on for a long time :)</li>
            <li>the colors is true to the pot, it doesn&#x27;t flake or fade over time...but use a nice base with it, because it smears really easy...</li>
            <li>I have problems getting the left eye to look like the right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>I only used the product on my top eye lid as per other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This gel goes on smooth and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>That said, it certainly wears longer than regular eyeliner</li>
            <li>Not like a pencil, but not messy like liquid.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way- nice thin lines, easy application.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>While the Starry Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner Gel goes on smoothly it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li>While the amazon product description clearly claims that it is waterproof, the product packaging simply states that it is long-wearing and water resistant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is very waterproof or long lasting..</li>
            <li>It barely lasts 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>I use eyeliner pretty much everyday</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff will last for a long, long, long time!!</li>
            <li> and this morning they are not exactly the same, but close.  </li>
            <li> but I have that same problem with other liners</li>
            <li> The tiny little brush helps.  </li>
            <li> It went into the trash after two tries.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it tends to smudge quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get an even line, it takes a long time to dry and ends up in the crease of my eyelid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the applicator and look for something a little creamier.</li>
            <li> but when i opened it and it was a bit dried out but after 20 seconds in a microwave</li>
            <li> All-in-all, it&#x27;s not too bad for the price, just wish it didn&#x27;t smudge quite as much.    </li>
            <li> I did the bad thing and tossed all paperwork to send it back before I used it as I have never purchased an eyeliner that was bad enough to send back.</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed when my eyeliner gel arrived.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to eye makeup in my life, but this product caused a painful red rash around my eyes.</li>
            <li> when it comes to putting liquid eyeliner on and 9 times out of 10 i have to restart all over again bc of how difficult it is</li>
            <li> Usually by now, I would need to touch up, which I hate.  </li>
            <li> Do not use on bottom unless you want disastrous results.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just annoying.   </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this sub-par product.</li>

            <li> This stuff will last for a long, long, long time!! A little goes a long way- nice thin lines, easy application.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it has a beautiful texture and glides on smoothly, making application a breeze. The color is rich and honestly I prefer using this to the Bobbi Brown gel I used to use.   On the other hand, it tends to smudge quite a bit. The first day, I used it without a primer and it smudged so much I had to keep re-touching my make-up. So on the second day, I tried using it with a primer, and it still smudged.   All-in-all, it&#x27;s not too bad for the price, just wish it didn&#x27;t smudge quite as much.    Update Apr 25th 2011: I didn&#x27;t want to throw this out even though it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me as an eyeliner, so I thought I&#x27;d try using it as a cream eyeshadow to see if I could create a smoky eye look with. I&#x27;m happy to report that it stayed on all day with no problems and because of its rich color, it was easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to eye makeup in my life, but this product caused a painful red rash around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and tried this morning.  I was amazed.  It goes on so smoothly.  Not like a pencil, but not messy like liquid.  I have problems getting the left eye to look like the right and this morning they are not exactly the same, but close.  The tiny little brush helps.  It is now 4 hours later and it looks like I just put it on.  Usually by now, I would need to touch up, which I hate.  I put some on in the morning and rarely think about make up again unless I am going out in the evening.    I have tried so many...Shiseido, Mary Kay are, make that were, the ones I have been using.    So far, so great!</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed when my eyeliner gel arrived. While the amazon product description clearly claims that it is waterproof, the product packaging simply states that it is long-wearing and water resistant. That said, it certainly wears longer than regular eyeliner but it&#x27;s not as durable as waterproof liner. On the plus side, I just can&#x27;t say enough about how versatile and smooth this liner is! You an achieve any look and it&#x27;s so much easier than liquid eyeliner. The \\&quot;wand\\&quot; pokes the hell out of your eyelid, but it really does a bang up job! Four stars, and I&#x27;ll probably (begrudgingly) buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  I love the dark brown color.  I love how easily and well it flows onto the eye.  I just wish it lasted longer than an hour.  That&#x27;s it.  That&#x27;s all I get.  I put my makeup on before I wake up the kids.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to leave the house, it&#x27;s gone.  I wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li> After trying to use it 3 times I tossed it in the trash this morning. It&#x27;s very hard to get an even line, it takes a long time to dry and ends up in the crease of my eyelid and it did not withstand summer temps in my area of central CA. On a 100+ degree day this eyeliner melted all over my face. I did the bad thing and tossed all paperwork to send it back before I used it as I have never purchased an eyeliner that was bad enough to send back.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer.  The applicator brush would be perfect with the right product, but the product itself is what I would describe as grainy.  I&#x27;ll keep the applicator and look for something a little creamier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite black - it&#x27;s more of a brown color. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product... Just doesn&#x27;t come out the color I want on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> While the Starry Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner Gel goes on smoothly it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as I had expected. It does smear on the top before it completely dries and smears/runs really bad on the bottom lid. While it is \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; it isn&#x27;t makeup or cream proof.</li>
            <li> I was originally impressed with this product.  Easy to use.  Gave me the look I wanted.  Until about an hour into my day.  I would realize I would have smears all around my eyes.  I only used the product on my top eye lid as per other reviews.  Do not use on bottom unless you want disastrous results.  I somehow would still end up with eyeliner smeared under my eyes.  It&#x27;s as if it never sets or dries.  It was worth a try for the price but I&#x27;ll be ordering a different brand.</li>
            <li> This gel goes on smooth and is long lasting.  It creates the smoky eye look in a \\&quot;flash\\&quot;.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I took this overseas with me and wore it in 135degree weather and it still stayed put. I ordered the chocolate brown, which is quite dark and it looks awesome. The brush is pretty good, you just have to wash it every now and again. This stuff stays put all day and glides on nicely. You do need to set it with powder or shadow or primer so it doesn&#x27;t end up on your upper lid but I have that same problem with other liners so I think it&#x27;s my eyelids, not the liner. I will definately order this when mine runs out- although I&#x27;ve had the same pot for over a year- and I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I got this Product on Decumber 5...I still have it.  It is a very good Amout and everything but i put it on before Dance and in the middle of glass it was fading so i had it on for about 30 minutes and it already started to fade..I don&#x27;t think this is very waterproof or long lasting..But if your like me and Dont care just buy it.. I still use it if you use primer Like urban decay primer potion it doest stay on for a long time :)</li>
            <li> I use eyeliner pretty much everyday and I use a range of products from super high end to drug store quality ...and this is a really good quality product for the price...the colors is true to the pot, it doesn&#x27;t flake or fade over time...but use a nice base with it, because it smears really easy...but over all not bad :)</li>
            <li> I love this gel eyeliner!I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to putting liquid eyeliner on and 9 times out of 10 i have to restart all over again bc of how difficult it is but with this one I get it done the first time and real quick too! I don&#x27;t need to restart or anything! It&#x27;s AMAZING :)  My lines come out perfect and the fact that I have complete control of the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; AND to choose how much or little liner i want to put on my eyes is GREAT!  The only problem with this is that it does have the tendency of smudging through out the day and that&#x27;s just annoying.   Spite that flaw I would still recommend this product! I would just advise you not to wear it if you&#x27;re going out and will be sweating a lot or something just to avoid getting raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT long-lasting. It barely lasts 2 seconds. Very disappointed with this sub-par product. I am still on the lookout for the perfect eyeliner</li>
            <li> It was smeary to me and did not stay put or last at all.  It went into the trash after two tries.</li>
            <li> Creamy but when i opened it and it was a bit dried out but after 20 seconds in a microwave it&#x27;s brand new</li>
