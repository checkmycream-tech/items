            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I recently experienced a shoulder injury to my rotator cuff.</li>

            <li>Wonderful application coverage and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>But I love the product!</li>
            <li>The handle is made out of some kind of elastic band.</li>
            <li>just wish there was a way to warm it up....</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable, very easy to use, provides a nice even coat over any area and is truly non absorbent.</li>
            <li>Many years ago a friend of mine demonstrated how to use the Body Buddy and why she gave them to elderly friends of hers.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I did</li>
            <li>I use this to apply coconut oil to my back and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is just an okay applicator.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion applicator.</li>
            <li>I think a canvass type material would be better and give greater traction.</li>
            <li>Glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Every inch of my back is pleasantly tan!  </li>
            <li>My back becomes incredibly itchy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>Easy also to just hold onto the end of the vinyl and not use the handles.</li>
            <li>It might be a very good product for lotion, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this to apply cream on yourself unless you can deal with the minor problems of this product.</li>
            <li>The material is like a smooth leather.  </li>
            <li>Great for getting suncreen on your back without having to ask someone to help you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li>This applicator provides great assistance when putting lotion my back.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this product and it did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>I love the non absorbent material, and it&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
            <li>I wipe it clean with one tissue and fold it up.</li>
            <li>It wipes clean.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use, easy to clean, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion applicator, great for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>When the pool boy isn&#x27;t around, it works great for applying sunscreen on your back and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your bag.  </li>
            <li>It really does a great job because my back is not all sticky with petroleum jelly after applying, yet I can still feel the mix.</li>
            <li>She said  the product works perfectly for not only applying lotion, but also in the shower for washing her back.</li>
            <li>Not absorbent at all, it&#x27;s perfect for evenly spreading lotion of any kind in those hard to reach places on your back</li>
            <li>The material is great, and the handles allow you to stretch the material a little bit farther and hit all the spots.</li>
            <li>great little invention.  </li>
            <li>Cream is applied to skin and is absorbed into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you personal freedom, not having to depend on someone else to reach places you can&#x27;t on your own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it because I don&#x27;t feel its worth returning.</li>
            <li>When you try to apply cream onto your skin, the Body Buddy Lotion Applicator kind of gets stuck to your skin so it isn&#x27;t very easy to apply cream onto your skin (especially your back).</li>
            <li>They seem fine to me and actually help secure the Body Buddy when you roll it up.  </li>
            <li>works great if your a little gentle with it</li>
            <li>Like as if it got over stretched which it did because the Body Buddy lotion applicator didn&#x27;t slide across the skin very easily.</li>
            <li>Also great for applying lotion to those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is much better in getting lotion evenly applied all over my back, and rubbed in.</li>
            <li>I was able to put sunblock on my back without asking my friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Stretch handles are a bit strange, i would have liked it a little more if they were solid, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li>Solved the problem by putting a big bright red dot at each end of one side.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy for me to get lotion applied to my back.  </li>
            <li>She said it works really well.</li>
            <li>What really impresses me though is the fact that the jelly does not stay on the Body Buddy.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really need to try it and see if it works.</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has really helped me a lot.</li>
            <li>of all, by putting the lotion on the applicator, spreading it around, then folding it up and popping it into the microwave for ten seconds, you can apply WARM lotion to your back</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and I have tried MANY items in an effort to get moisture onto my back, but none of them worked consistently.</li>
            <li>applicator works well for my particular needs...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You can feel when all of the material has been transferred because you get a little more resistance from the Buddy on your skin.     </li>
            <li>This product cost little bit more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I like this applicator.  </li>
            <li>Since I bought this product I&#x27;ve been able to apply lotion to my back after I get out of the shower every morning and has completely resolved my itchy back problem.</li>
            <li>i can do my whole back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied no more itchy back.</li>
            <li>You never have left over oil or residue, it wipes off while applying to your skin, dries and is ready for the next use no matter what you are putting on.</li>
            <li>A dollop on the vinyl  non absorbent applicator, spread it out a bit and flip it over and massage it back and forth all over my back making sure to get in between the shoulder blades from the back of my neck all the way down to my lower back.  </li>
            <li>Product makes it easy to apply lotions to those hard to reach areas and it also worked for my medicated lotion that I needed to apply to my back also.</li>
            <li>No dry skin this winter!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various back lotion applicators over the years, but this one completely scratches my itch ...</li>
            <li>Cold lotion on your back does not feel good.</li>
            <li>Previously I&#x27;d used one of those foam  applicators on a stick which never worked very well.  </li>

            <li> Previously I&#x27;d used one of those foam  applicators on a stick which never worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough that when you grab both ends you don&#x27;t feel like a contortionist.  </li>
            <li> it does last a long time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> It was awkward at first, but then I got used to it and am very grateful for a product like this!</li>
            <li> Then the handles stretched out and it ni longer works as well.</li>
            <li> As long as I can see those in the mirror</li>
            <li> It was slightly very difficult, but it actually did its job which made me satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use a petroleum jelly mix twice a day for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> While a little expensive, not being itchy is very worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this ever day, two or three times a day since it arrived and have a feeling this will hold up to heavy use for a long long time.</li>
            <li> The texture felt like rough leather.</li>
            <li> It distributes the lotion evenly and widely.  </li>
            <li> As with a lot of other people during the winter months my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I bought it from the other Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other applicators, but they always seemed to break and they didn&#x27;t spread lotion evenly.</li>
            <li> Always had trouble reaching that one little spot in the upper mid-back, but this thing did the trick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you with lotion not absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I keep this applicator in my swim bag and use it nearly everyday ..,.Pool</li>
            <li> Hard to apply cream since the material of the product was roughly stuck to your skin and hard to move it in the direction</li>
            <li> No more gasping as the cold lotion hits bare</li>
            <li> puts the lotion in those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> the product, but few minors problem that annoyed me a bit</li>
            <li> The mix needs to be spread evenly and thinly.</li>
            <li> The glob of jelly that I put on the Buddy gets spread evenly and thinly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law.  She said it works really well.</li>
            <li> i love my body buddy!!! it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Always had trouble reaching that one little spot in the upper mid-back, but this thing did the trick. The material is great, and the handles allow you to stretch the material a little bit farther and hit all the spots.</li>
            <li> If you need to put lotion on your back, because no one else will, thins thing rules!!!</li>
            <li> Body Buddy is a great invention.  When the pool boy isn&#x27;t around, it works great for applying sunscreen on your back and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your bag.  Also great for applying lotion to those hard to reach spots.  Some reviewers criticized the elastic handles.  They seem fine to me and actually help secure the Body Buddy when you roll it up.  Easy also to just hold onto the end of the vinyl and not use the handles.</li>
            <li> I use a petroleum jelly mix twice a day for extremely dry skin. I took a chance that the Body Buddy could handle something thicker than lotion.     The mix needs to be spread evenly and thinly. It really does a great job because my back is not all sticky with petroleum jelly after applying, yet I can still feel the mix. The glob of jelly that I put on the Buddy gets spread evenly and thinly. You can feel when all of the material has been transferred because you get a little more resistance from the Buddy on your skin.     What really impresses me though is the fact that the jelly does not stay on the Body Buddy. It transfers to the skin with nothing left on the Buddy. I wipe it clean with one tissue and fold it up.</li>
            <li> Ordered it on March 22, 2015 and received it on March 27, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Just uploaded a photo of the Body Buddy Handle that I mentioned about how it got ruined in just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, but few minors problem that annoyed me a bit and I only just used this once. The texture felt like rough leather. When you try to apply cream onto your skin, the Body Buddy Lotion Applicator kind of gets stuck to your skin so it isn&#x27;t very easy to apply cream onto your skin (especially your back). I bought this product in order to help me apply my acne cream on my back. It was slightly very difficult, but it actually did its job which made me satisfied. The handle is made out of some kind of elastic band. I tried to use the handle to apply the cream on my back and I have to say, it sucked, lol. I messed up the elastic band so now its all wrinkly, I guess. Like as if it got over stretched which it did because the Body Buddy lotion applicator didn&#x27;t slide across the skin very easily. It might be a very good product for lotion, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this to apply cream on yourself unless you can deal with the minor problems of this product. I also wish that it had been a bit longer too. I found it too short since the handles were quite useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: cream&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cream is applied to skin and is absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to apply cream since the material of the product was roughly stuck to your skin and hard to move it in the direction you want it to.</li>
            <li> i can do my whole back</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product and it did exactly what I needed it to do. Then the handles stretched out and it ni longer works as well. It flips over to the opposite side and will not stay in place as I u see it. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  It distributes the lotion evenly and widely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you with lotion not absorbed.  It&#x27;s soft and cool to the touch.  The material is like a smooth leather.  It wipes clean.  We leave it hanging on the bathroom door hook.  It&#x27;s long enough that when you grab both ends you don&#x27;t feel like a contortionist.  It gives you personal freedom, not having to depend on someone else to reach places you can&#x27;t on your own.</li>
            <li> The Body Buddy works great.</li>
            <li> Product makes it easy to apply lotions to those hard to reach areas and it also worked for my medicated lotion that I needed to apply to my back also.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Only wish it was a different color on each side as I tended to get it turned over during the back rub.  Solved the problem by putting a big bright red dot at each end of one side.  As long as I can see those in the mirror I know that I have the lotion side against my back.</li>
            <li> This is great!  I bought it from the other Amazon reviews.  Previously I&#x27;d used one of those foam  applicators on a stick which never worked very well.  This is much better in getting lotion evenly applied all over my back, and rubbed in.</li>
            <li> This is a great product works especially good with self tanners. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my trip to Maui. I was able to put sunblock on my back without asking my friend. It really does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I used to get sunburned because I missed some spots on my back but not anymore</li>
            <li> Great for getting suncreen on your back without having to ask someone to help you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this applicator for my swim bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator works well for my particular needs... I keep this applicator in my swim bag and use it nearly everyday ..,.Pool chemicals wreck havoc on my back with this applicator I have an appliance that will both wash and lotion my back after my daily swim.  It takes next to no room and it dries in no time...I&#x27;m satisfied no more itchy back.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Great help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various back lotion applicators over the years, but this one completely scratches my itch ... er, moisturizes it.  I love the non absorbent material, and it&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend who needed someone to put lotion on her back - since I was hundreds  of miles away I  purchased this product.  She said  the product works perfectly for not only applying lotion, but also in the shower for washing her back.</li>
            <li> It does the job... just wish there was a way to warm it up.... that would make it perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great product for self-application of sunless tanner. Product appears to be made well.  Stretch handles are a bit strange, i would have liked it a little more if they were solid, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Makes putting lotion on my back a breeze.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this with a lotion warmer.  Cold lotion on your back does not feel good. Great product.</li>
            <li> I tell myself I&#x27;m going to use it, then forget its there. I really need to try it and see if it works.</li>
            <li> I use this to apply sunless tanner and lotions. It was awkward at first, but then I got used to it and am very grateful for a product like this! Now I don&#x27;t have to bug my husband all the time to help with lotion or end up streaky from his help with tanning products. I recommended this immediately to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking for. Works great. Applying lotion on my back has never been easier. I definitely don&#x27;t need to bother anyone anymore to do it for me!</li>
            <li> This applicator is the best ever. It is very comfortable, very easy to use, provides a nice even coat over any area and is truly non absorbent. I will use it to put tanning oil or sunscreen on before outdoor activities, afterwards I will use it to put Aloe or Lotion on. You never have left over oil or residue, it wipes off while applying to your skin, dries and is ready for the next use no matter what you are putting on. I have been using this ever day, two or three times a day since it arrived and have a feeling this will hold up to heavy use for a long long time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is easy to use! I have really dry skin, and I have tried MANY items in an effort to get moisture onto my back, but none of them worked consistently. This reaches all of the areas on your back. You do not have to struggle to make it work. It&#x27;s easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, easy to clean, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Many years ago a friend of mine demonstrated how to use the Body Buddy and why she gave them to elderly friends of hers.  I thought it was a great idea and she gave me one for my birthday.  I was very happy with the results and gave them to my parents to use.  This is a good product it it does last a long time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion applicator, great for hard to reach places. This along with my bath brush works great.</li>
            <li> It works!  Such a simple idea.  I use this for sunless tanning lotion.  A dollop on the vinyl  non absorbent applicator, spread it out a bit and flip it over and massage it back and forth all over my back making sure to get in between the shoulder blades from the back of my neck all the way down to my lower back.  Every inch of my back is pleasantly tan!  I bought one for my BF and an extra as backup.</li>
            <li> Not absorbent at all, it&#x27;s perfect for evenly spreading lotion of any kind in those hard to reach places on your back</li>
            <li> This is even nicer than I expected---it makes putting lotion on my back very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, by putting the lotion on the applicator, spreading it around, then folding it up and popping it into the microwave for ten seconds, you can apply WARM lotion to your back---priceless!  No more gasping as the cold lotion hits bare skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That trick alone makes this thing the only way to go for applying lotion without a helper.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works great if your a little gentle with it</li>
            <li> This product cost little bit more than I wanted to spend but I&#x27;m glad that I did it has really helped me a lot. As with a lot of other people during the winter months my skin gets very dry. My back becomes incredibly itchy. Since I bought this product I&#x27;ve been able to apply lotion to my back after I get out of the shower every morning and has completely resolved my itchy back problem. While a little expensive, not being itchy is very worth it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I like this applicator.  It makes it easy for me to get lotion applied to my back.  I&#x27;ve tried some other applicators, but they always seemed to break and they didn&#x27;t spread lotion evenly.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a lotion applicator that did not absorb the lotion for years... I finally found it!</li>
            <li> I use this to apply coconut oil to my back and it works perfectly. Wonderful application coverage and easy to use. I only put the oil on one side and then fold it up to store so oil doesn&#x27;t get on anything else but me.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> This is just an okay applicator.  I&#x27;ll keep it because I don&#x27;t feel its worth returning.</li>
            <li> great little invention.  puts the lotion in those hard to reach places.  Also ordered the lotion warmer.  No dry skin this winter!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion applicator. The only thing I would change is &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; I would not make them out elastic. I think a canvass type material would be better and give greater traction. But I love the product!</li>
            <li> Great product. I recently experienced a shoulder injury to my rotator cuff. This applicator provides great assistance when putting lotion my back. Glad to have it.</li>
