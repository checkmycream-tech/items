            <li>I was so excited to get this set after reading the many online reviews.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>two huge mistakes and hits to my ego</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works !!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant hair growth</li>
            <li>The leave-in in this set is awesome but too small.</li>
            <li>i like that the treatment makes my hair feel nice and soft...</li>
            <li>Love itttt made my hair so soft in just first use...will be using from now on love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and after using just once hair is so smooth soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>like i just said good product fast service, the only thing is that if you dont know how to read spanish you are lost, their translator didnt do a good job.</li>
            <li>The smell is a good smell but a little overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love how this product leave my hair soft, shinny</li>
            <li>My hair looks pretty good after I blow dry it...</li>
            <li>i wouldnt recommend using it if youre not going to do it right.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I used the leave-in conditioner and I was totally impressed that I was able to detangle my hair (shoulder length with tight curls) in just a few minutes with ease.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad but its a lottle strong just like regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product for my relaxed (2xs year) hair and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>I love the deep conditioner and the rinse.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>First I wanna say that I used this brand for quite sometime</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than commercial shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and leaves my hair soft, tangle free and alot stronger.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice, but that&#x27;s where it ends I&#x27;ve used the product twice and still not impressed I use these product on my daughter&#x27;s hair, who has a nice grade of hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of products after reading all of the positive reviews...</li>
            <li>I used the whole set and, although the shampoo made my hair feel a little rough at first, the treatment, rinse, and leave in made my hair feel soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and looks like I have a fresh relaxer (natural 4c hair mind you)</li>
            <li>Really does what it says it does</li>
            <li>The leave-in, not so much.  </li>
            <li>really moisturised and keeps the humidity out.</li>
            <li>Cheaper on Amazon, twice as much in the stores.</li>
            <li>the 4th ingredient is fragrance and the smell is very over powering</li>
            <li>I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really like how the shampoo and the rinse makes my hair kinky and tangled...</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and the fast shipping</li>
            <li>I noticed that it was tangling more as it dried.</li>
            <li>Instructions are now very clear</li>
            <li>I bought the complete set.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that the shampoo is very drying.</li>
            <li>I use the complete line: shampoo, conditioner, rinse and leave-</li>
            <li>I bought this product (the complete system)</li>
            <li>I use this in my and my 7 year olds hair we have textured naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes I checked and my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft, so i sat under the dryer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch but not as shiny as id like.</li>
            <li>I found the product made my hair soft and mangerable .....</li>
            <li>- I went natural but didn&#x27;t cut off all the treated part.</li>
            <li>no - you don&#x27;t want your hair smelling like old egg or avocado now</li>
            <li>I am a natural 3c/4a.</li>
            <li>I have curly natural hair-</li>
            <li>The conditioner , rinse, and leave in leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>first because it was so cheap and second because ive been addicted to garnier fructis forever.</li>
            <li>It last a long time but you cannot find it at a normal beauty supply store</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m a product junkie now back to the subject.</li>
            <li>I have african american natural strands that I color frequently so my hair is dry and needs tons of moisture.</li>
            <li>I am african american female with natural (non-relaxed) hair.</li>
            <li>I guess my expectations are high after using other quality dominican products like those by alter ego.  </li>
            <li>It has really softened my hair , and there is less breakage and tangling, the rinse especially works well as a detangler.  </li>

            <li> I guess my expectations are high after using other quality dominican products like those by alter ego.  </li>
            <li> It has really softened my hair , and there is less breakage and tangling, the rinse especially works well as a detangler.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find the complete line at any beauty supply store in and around the area I live.</li>
            <li> , the blonde changed my texture and the shortness made it almost unbearable after years with long hair.</li>
            <li> It last a long time still using it.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and after washing it one or twice my hair becomes dry and coarse but with Crece Pelo, my hair remains smoothe.  </li>
            <li> On to the rinse, this was easier to apply but it didn&#x27;t really do anything, my hair still felt hard and tangled.</li>
            <li> You you only need to use a little of the shampoo to lather well, so it lasts for a bit, the treatment as well, its barely 1/4 gone</li>
            <li> I found the feeling to be rather strange</li>
            <li> After the set and dry, My ends which were fraying and dry as i rolled my hair came out frayed and dry after the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my hair and applied the shampoo, which made my hair feel striped.</li>
            <li> The Product is exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> I have thick hair...and using just a little isn&#x27;t enough...</li>
            <li> It is thick and hard to get complete coverage since my strands were still tangled from the washing.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less breakage too.</li>
            <li> My hair was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> Came on time and sealed tightly.  </li>
            <li> When I rinsed my hair felt a little softer and just a little less tangled.</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo set because I wanted a product that would help to detangle my hair without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> However, oddly it made my scalp itch excessively...</li>

            <li> Instructions are now very clear I know it is from another country and have used it only once.  Can&#x27;t tell if the products is working at this time</li>
            <li> I bought the complete set. This product smells great. Very fresh! I love the deep conditioner and the rinse. My only complaints are that the shampoo is very drying. I have relaxed 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the 4 set of Crece Pelo.  It leaves my hair looking relaxed.  I have relaxed hair and after washing it one or twice my hair becomes dry and coarse but with Crece Pelo, my hair remains smoothe.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth yet but then again I have only used it twice.  The smell is not bad but its a lottle strong just like regular shampoos.  I love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I use the complete line: shampoo, conditioner, rinse and leave-in... it works better when you use them all together. I relaxed my hair and I love how this product leave my hair soft, shinny, the smell is great and my hair is really growing faster !!!!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this.... first because it was so cheap and second because ive been addicted to garnier fructis forever. But id bleached AND cut my hair. two huge mistakes and hits to my ego, the blonde changed my texture and the shortness made it almost unbearable after years with long hair. I bought this product (the complete system) the shampoo leaves a weird texture to your hair but the conditioner, rinse and leave in are heaven sent. i wouldnt recommend using it if youre not going to do it right. I use this in my and my 7 year olds hair we have textured naturally curly hair. and were Dominican. Im even trying BOEs lotion products now too, like i said love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and it smells wonderful. I love the products!</li>
            <li> Just the best s*** I ever used.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this set after reading the many online reviews. I ended up buying mine from a Dominican product website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so very disappointed! I started by pre-pooing my hair and scalp. Then.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my hair and applied the shampoo, which made my hair feel striped. While I was washing I actually heard a hair strand snap! It was downhill from there! My hair was a tangled mess. I then applied the treatment. It is thick and hard to get complete coverage since my strands were still tangled from the washing. After 15 minutes I checked and my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft, so i sat under the dryer for 10 minutes. When I rinsed my hair felt a little softer and just a little less tangled. On to the rinse, this was easier to apply but it didn&#x27;t really do anything, my hair still felt hard and tangled. The fourth and final step.... The leave in.  I used about a quarter size amount for my hair and although it made the tangles looser, I still struggled with the comb thru even though I applied extra product to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As  I set my hair  I noticed that it was tangling more as it dried. Yes my hair was drying before I could get it all set! Uggghhh!  After the set and dry, My ends which were fraying and dry as i rolled my hair came out frayed and dry after the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some positives..... My hair smells great! It&#x27;s soft to the touch but not as shiny as id like. I guess my expectations are high after using other quality dominican products like those by alter ego.  With the amount of struggle I had to use on my strands to use this line... The negatives outweigh the positives for me. I&#x27;m babying my hair these days! My hair definitely didn&#x27;t and doesnt  feel babied after using this line.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and my two daughters and it conditions so well and smells wonderful for days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of products after reading all of the positive reviews...I am african american female with natural (non-relaxed) hair. I found the product made my hair soft and mangerable .....However, oddly it made my scalp itch excessively...I found the feeling to be rather strange so I gave the product another chance and in doing so I continued to have this scalp itch...I can say that I will not order this product again...I rather Silicon Mix....with that product I have beautiful results with NO ITCH!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hi. I have been using BOE for like a month now. The set is really good.  It has really softened my hair , and there is less breakage and tangling, the rinse especially works well as a detangler.  You you only need to use a little of the shampoo to lather well, so it lasts for a bit, the treatment as well, its barely 1/4 gone and I wash my hair every 3-4 days so its good. The leave in is a bit sticky ( or it could be the last bits of my chemical-treated hair - I went natural but didn&#x27;t cut off all the treated part. :). )  And to top it all off, th best part, it makes the hair smell really good, which is of utmost importance no - you don&#x27;t want your hair smelling like old egg or avocado now hmm.  Anyway, I have enjoyed it but as to whether my hair is growing faster because of it, well, lets see...</li>
            <li> like i just said good product fast service, the only thing is that if you dont know how to read spanish you are lost, their translator didnt do a good job.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works !!! I will buy over and over. I got 2 inches in 2 months</li>
            <li> Love this product it works perfectly make your hair soooo shiny and soft...love it:-)</li>
            <li> I used these products today for the first time and I have to say THEY ARE AMAZING! I used the whole set and, although the shampoo made my hair feel a little rough at first, the treatment, rinse, and leave in made my hair feel soft and wonderful! It made my hair easier to comb through. I did a blowout and can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair now. It&#x27;s silky and looks like I have a fresh relaxer (natural 4c hair mind you)&amp; I haven&#x27;t relaxed my hair in years. I would recommend these to anyone. The smell is nice and light not overbearing at all and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all greasy. TWO THUMBS UP for sure!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo set because I wanted a product that would help to detangle my hair without harsh chemicals. I used the shampoo followed by the rinse and then the conditioner. Afterwards, I used the leave-in conditioner and I was totally impressed that I was able to detangle my hair (shoulder length with tight curls) in just a few minutes with ease. I will continue to use this combo set.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning for a while now, and I have been using this product for a while now. I love the smell, it leaves my hair smelling great and with more volume. I see more hairs now. very cool</li>
            <li> Love itttt made my hair so soft in just first use...will be using from now on love this product. Really does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Love the smell and after using just once hair is so smooth soft and shiney. Cannot wait to see how the growth rate is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always like multi-step hair treatments but so far this one isn&#x27;t that bad and I have noticed a difference in how my hair feels.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant hair growth but it&#x27;s only been a month.  The smell is a good smell but a little overwhelmingly strong.  I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t have to relax my hair often but using these products I don&#x27;t think I will relax again.  I go to Dominican hair dressers and I have always like the products they use.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ll update later.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, treatment and the rinse.  The leave-in, not so much.  It kind of made my hair feel tangled.  The shampoo has a strong clean soap perfume smell that kind of lingers.  I would purchase this product again, just not the leave-in.  I am a natural 3c/4a.</li>
            <li> Love it, it smells good and makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li> The smell is so nice, but that&#x27;s where it ends I&#x27;ve used the product twice and still not impressed I use these product on my daughter&#x27;s hair, who has a nice grade of hair. I thought it would make her hair easier to comb, NOPE...still the same. I don&#x27;t know what the big fuss is all about. I should use the items as a body wash cause they sure don&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent and will purchase this product again</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair combo set ever.It is very moisturizing and leaves my hair soft, tangle free and alot stronger.The best buy ever will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says it will do. My hair feels stronger and healthier.  Follow the instructions on how often to use and you will see immediate results.  Company works great and delivery was timely. Should you have any issues with the delivery of the product just contact the seller and they will resolve it on the spot.</li>
            <li> This is a great set! Keeps hair really moisturised and keeps the humidity out. The leave-in in this set is awesome but too small. I use this with the Silicon Intensive Treatment by Avanti (got it from Amazon). The only downside is the shampoo but I can&#x27;t take a star off. The shampoo has SLS in it and it can be drying so I add oil. Other than that its a great product for my relaxed (2xs year) hair and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. Cheaper on Amazon, twice as much in the stores.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is awesome. It doesnt strip your hair and the whole line up is great! Will re-order soon. I am very pleased how my hair turned out after using this product. Update: the 4th ingredient is fragrance and the smell is very over powering but it does work well.</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot. I have curly natural hair- and this is perfect. defines my curls. I have noticed less breakage too. It has only been a month, but I am hooked. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> My hair looks pretty good after I blow dry it...i like that the treatment makes my hair feel nice and soft...and it smells really good...other than that..i don&#x27;t really like how the shampoo and the rinse makes my hair kinky and tangled...and I&#x27;m disappointed that the leave in is so small...why can&#x27;t they make it a bigger bottle? I have thick hair...and using just a little isn&#x27;t enough...frankly everything but the treatment har is kinda small...I&#x27;ve only used it twice...so I&#x27;m gonna give it more of a chance</li>
            <li> Great value and expeditious delivery.  Combo set is wonderful and can&#x27;t believe that everything I need was included for a GREAT price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I needed something that was going to tame my hair. First of all I&#x27;m a product junkie now back to the subject. After looking at many reviews I decided to give this line a try. It was hard to find the complete line at any beauty supply store in and around the area I live. Thanks to Amazon and the fast shipping I&#x27;m grateful. After using it once I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I have african american natural strands that I color frequently so my hair is dry and needs tons of moisture. I must say now I&#x27;m in love with it. The shampoo can be drying so I use it as a clarifying shampoo after days of product build up. The conditioner , rinse, and leave in leaves my hair so soft. Many reviews talks about the product&#x27;s strong odor but I like it. This is a must try hair care line . I wished I knew about it sooner</li>
            <li> It makes my hair Feel good But then It sheds from the roots after a while. I don&#x27;t quite understand that.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair products</li>
            <li> Love all of these products. Went to the beauty salon and notice they use these products. It last a long time but you cannot find it at a normal beauty supply store</li>
            <li> The product  worked for me. Great  seller fast shipping, great price for products. It last a long time still using it.</li>
            <li> Adquiri esta kit porque debido a tantas tinturas mi cabello se ha deteriorado mucho, no tenia brillo y se ma caia a montones, he venido usando este kit por dos semana y me encanta, mi cabello esta empezando a brillar, se me cae menos y he notado crecimiento, ademas huele delicioso. Lo recomiendo 100%</li>
            <li> Great product and it smell really good. My hair is permed and it still works. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> The Product is exactly as expected.  Came on time and sealed tightly.  I love it and will order from them again and again</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft and I love the smell</li>
            <li> First I wanna say that I used this brand for quite sometime and it was good, not the best tho. I only saw a lil bit of difference in my hair but it&#x27;s better than commercial shampoos and conditioners.</li>
