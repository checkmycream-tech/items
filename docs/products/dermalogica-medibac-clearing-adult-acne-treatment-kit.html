            <li>I use this kit interchangeably with the UltraCalming kit, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The cleanser for this product is great.</li>
            <li>I have seen great rules with the medibac system.</li>

            <li>ordered this for my son as we have tried everything on the market-the 1st time we got wonderful results, my son  was pleased as was i.  </li>
            <li>but it did make my face smooth and helped my make up go on Perfect and stay all day!</li>
            <li>The night gel is good though.</li>
            <li>LOVED it from day 1.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to have a flawless, smooth finish after applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this and gave it a try, saved me lots of cash.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li>I now have a respectful understanding of what others who chronically suffer from acne are going through!   </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>love this product and am hooked!</li>
            <li>the first thing a person sees, and you need to put your best face forward all the time.</li>
            <li>First time I can say I have beautiful skin!  </li>
            <li>I did not get amazing results</li>
            <li>Amazing............................:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and does everything I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>But the clay mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this kit before and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>product is amazing</li>
            <li>She gave me some samples to try and I liked the feel of the products.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of products</li>
            <li>It cleans nicely</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!</li>
            <li>The Dermalogica products were recommended to me by a make up artist who said it was the best line out there for adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>and ive been told that to maintain a good complexion for years to come--it is important to start at my age.</li>
            <li>experienced purging for the first couple days of using this product.</li>
            <li>Good way to sample before buying full size.</li>
            <li>I am also lucky in that the spot treatment is fairly close to my skintone.  </li>
            <li>favorite items in the kit is the cleanser very light.</li>
            <li>This product felt amazing on my skin, the day and night creams are both very light and comfortable</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My face felt like oily with it but oddly more acne...</li>
            <li>The only product in this kit that I would buy again is the CLearing Mattifier, I didn&#x27;t have an effect on my acne, but it&#x27;s basically a make up primer, and it&#x27;s probably the best primer</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve taken the mattifier out of my routine and my face is clearing up rapidly and the oilyness is getting better too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a miracle worker, eliminating many of my zits overnight.  </li>
            <li>I had ok results with the product, some of them worked better than others.</li>
            <li>This product helped my skin feel better and my acne cleared up.</li>
            <li>I expect she will buy more.  </li>
            <li>However, it did nothing more than what we have purchased in the stores</li>
            <li>I have used Dermalogica products for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the overnight clearing gel and clearing spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product broke my face out even more than it already was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking most of the products.</li>
            <li>Now my acne is not completly cleared up but it has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Gel - FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>feeling from the face wash which I love.</li>
            <li>I gave 2 stars because I really enjoyed the concealer spot treatment, as well as the clearing mask.</li>
            <li>The clearing mask is cooling and refreshing, while the concealer did work well as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I love a scrub and wish this kit came with a scrub, instead of foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>I should have read the sizes better.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and I did not use it on most of my neck.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li>but I had so many of them along with whiteheads all over my face.</li>
            <li>The overnight clearing gel is okay, but the concealing spot treatment didn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and my skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li>The a skin clearing gel was my favorite--</li>
            <li>Thought it would help with breakouts but seem to get more.</li>
            <li>The tone is more even, for sure.</li>
            <li>Will I buy more?</li>
            <li>spf15 face lotion, and then spot treat with the concealer (that I wont buy more of once its out) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the product, I feel with this kit</li>
            <li>and I think created more problems.</li>
            <li>I really love dermalogica products, the skin mattifier makes a smooth surface for makeup!</li>
            <li>I am not using the face mask in this kit - I am in love with a separate sulfur mask that works better at reducing oil and redness.</li>
            <li>And I use the overnight cleaner all over my face, my face feels very fresh when I go to bed at night!  </li>
            <li>Great product - highly recommend for people over 30 with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>I had never had many days of smooth skin, but some days of the month, my skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Results are awesome.....have not seen a huge breakout yet :)</li>
            <li>The service was great and it got here pretty fast!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist referred me for a quick consultation with her!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had clear skin for the first time since before pre-teen years and it makes me feel so great that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to wear makeup now :)</li>
            <li>The Clearing Mattifier is also really nice and gets absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for about a month now and have noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>This system is different as it doesn&#x27;t come with a toner or moisturizer like others but it still worked great</li>
            <li>wish they were bigger because they are great products.</li>
            <li>Great as a spot treatment, and not overdrying if used on the entire face.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel smooth after using but has not helped the acne at all.</li>
            <li>I was the fortunate one who never had acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li>I am even comfortable going without makeup.</li>
            <li>My whole life I have had amazing skin, maybe a zit here and there</li>
            <li>Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] and have found the combination to be fantastic.</li>
            <li>The color matches my lightly tanned Asian skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li>I work out just about every day and make sure to wash my face right after.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>The overnight gel also does a great job of calming down my skin at night for a refreshing look in the morning.</li>
            <li>but if I was rich I would have this for work when I was feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;Tinted</li>
            <li>Ideally I would love to stick with my old skin system, and use the clearing mattifier on my t-zone, just for the extra oil control, not to rely on as a breakout reducer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought this trial pack to try and am now a believer and will continue to use this as long as I need too and can.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
            <li>But I was really pleased with the results after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now to work on stopping the acne in the first place :)</li>
            <li>I know the products here are pricey, and I like keeping my money, but sometimes you just have to realize you are worth it!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about the wash, but a tiny pea amount at a time washes nicely!  </li>
            <li>I see great results and love that my skin does not get dried out.</li>
            <li>I have been complimented on my clear glowing skin and i couldnt be more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This kit is awesome for me because I dont really use the other products that often.</li>
            <li>I received this product on Friday and started using it right away, because my skin has been out of control!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good brand with a lot of unique good products, but as a consumer who didn&#x27;t go to skin school, you&#x27;re not going to know better about what products will work for you (and they&#x27;re expensive).</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this Set to give the products a trial run before dumping hundreds of dollars on the full size product line.</li>
            <li>Overall a good value if u want to do a test run.</li>
            <li>A toner would be a nice addition to the kit, I am surprised that it doesn&#x27;t include one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser - Fairly basic, fairly drying.</li>
            <li>A product can only do so much and a body still needs care for good or better skin to result.</li>
            <li>AND the products I received were used and not even full.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased any full sized products yet</li>
            <li>It has ingredients that gives your face a cool and tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>and I would rather make the investment in the full size instead of wasting 40 bucks on an incomplete set.</li>
            <li>To have good skin health it is recommended to have a moisturizer which is used after the washing of the face and there is only a sample in the set.</li>
            <li>Overall good products.</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne, which is VERY hard to treat, so I am very pleased that this product line was so successful.</li>
            <li>seems like nice product but my skin is very oily and apparently needs more medication, as I broke out while using this-</li>
            <li>But I have been experimenting, and added in other products which seems to be working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly love this and believe in it so far!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work!!</li>
            <li>(Also use the Zeno hot spot for those spot treatments too, which with this works wonders!</li>
            <li>- it produces results, my face is clear!!!!!</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t sleep much, the product helps a lot to inhibit the intensity of breakouts, but my skin won&#x27;t be as smooth as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the line itself is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have to say I didn&#x27;t&#x27; really notice any difference in the oil control on my face, or much change in acne, but my face &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any moisturizers by Dermologica only because the one I have works great for me, Ambi Even and Clear with SPF 35</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for about 30 days and have seen breakouts in areas I rarely ever broke out in before (cheeks, neck,).</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the</li>
            <li>the morning, instead of using the wash on my face, I&#x27;m washing/rinsing only with warm water.</li>
            <li>and it made my face more clear</li>
            <li>I am 23 with oily skin and thinking this just isn&#x27;t the right combination of products for me.</li>
            <li>no results right away.</li>
            <li>... It was a realy good choice works well not that expensive and its so easy to use :) :</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but after 48hrs I can definitely see what my husband noticed the first day only better!</li>
            <li>I started using this right away and within the first month noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this product, she says its just OK, it works kind of slow.</li>
            <li>These products left my face feeling smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago, and right now I am dealing with more breakouts than I have ever EVER had in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>Very much like the description of cystic acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the overnight treatment, but it does help and for me, every little bit that helps, is blessing.</li>
            <li>An added bonus of this line is that my pores are significantly smaller than before and are better than they ever have been, regardless of the product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed a difference within the first 24hrs.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied though.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried the acne kit.  </li>
            <li>Mask - Second favorite in the kit.</li>
            <li>Of course, I see better results when used daily.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Dermalogica</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>I was happy that it at least seemed to help so</li>
            <li>do recommend this product and to give it about a week to start seeing first results.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I want to see if I can get more product with similar ingedients for a similar price.</li>
            <li>In Clinique doesn&#x27;t work, I will definitely go for Dermalogica because it makes my skin much better.</li>
            <li>Help with the oil at first, but then my skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li>I can only hope that their skin responds better to this product than mine did.</li>
            <li>About two weeks in, my skin is clear and smooth just as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I noticed the seal/ sticker at the top of the box was already cut open after removing the shrink wrap.</li>
            <li>I just buy the big bottle of the cleanser because I use that most</li>
            <li>I noticed that the first week</li>
            <li>AFTER this first week or so, it cleared up.</li>
            <li>Many different products to try before you buy.  </li>
            <li>I now feel soooo confident after just a week of only the face wash.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the extra stress set off my skin.</li>
            <li>Also too many steps to do especially since it&#x27;s not helping.</li>
            <li>Nice kit, still the size of the products is minimal.</li>
            <li>Dried out all my existing acne and has done a good job at preventing .</li>
            <li>I have do know that some acne products warn that the skin may get worse before it gets better, but I do want to find an acne regimen that will clear my skin of acne, blemishes/acne scars, shrink pores, eliminate oily skin and give me a nice even tone that&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>, I love the way this feels going on, and my skin feels smooth and soft all day long</li>
            <li>I feel like because I dont use the little bottles very often, its definately a good bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It leaves a persons skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>only gave this system 4 stars only because at the beginning it is drying but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I switched to the medibac kit out of curiosity from all of the positive things I have seen and heard about the dermalogica brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne pretty much since I stopped birth control.</li>
            <li>I usually have a good amount of break outs during my period, so I am dealing with hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>I seriously recommend avoiding the eye zone, because the Salicylic acid is more concentrated than most store products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dry out my skin like most acne meds.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and this kit has lasted me over a month with a lot left!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; products, so don&#x27;t expect anything large to come your way.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Ance treatment but they sent me Age Smart</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dermalogica is the first product that actually made a significant difference to my skin I used it for about two months.</li>
            <li>The two main things I will continue to keep are the clearing mattifier and the concealing spot treatment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; it keeps my acne at bay, but Mary Kay not only is a little better, it makes my skin softer and gives it a healthier look than this product.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out the way I do now.</li>
            <li>am very plesed with this product...</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying the the cleanser, clarifying mat cream, and overnight clearing gel.....</li>
            <li>I really hoped it would have helped</li>
            <li>I still use my normal face cleanser first and the follow-up with the cleanser in this kit using one of those circulating scrubbing brushes.</li>
            <li>I kept using it until my unusual breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin, you will need to wash your face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s entirety before really making a decision on wether or not it is working for you.</li>
            <li>I will not knock this product as a whole because this could just be my skin not agreeing with it.</li>
            <li>I go to bed with a light coat of the masque on the pimple and it is much smaller in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so much smoother after I picked at all the blackheads.</li>
            <li>I dont use the mask and gel (or others listed) very often--maybe once a week, once every two weeks maybe (??).</li>
            <li>so i dont use those products very often.</li>
            <li>I really like the clearing skin wash, clearing mattifier, and the sebum clearing masque.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
            <li>In desperation I bought this because my whole face was broke out.</li>
            <li>but this set absolutely worked.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Clogged my pores resulting in blackheads everywhere - very drying, made my skin flake and itch.</li>
            <li>I am about ready to order another.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to try this based on reviews, I really like it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the overnight gel really does anything.</li>
            <li>So you don&#x27;t have to do that whole blotting thing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was different, is that it would be nice to have a moisturizer with the purchase.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been able to reduce the overall presence of my acne</li>
            <li>So, that it definitely a unique aspect of this line and a big bonus.  </li>
            <li>I would say this product works as well as many of the other products I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>and I often used other lotions on top of it anyways.</li>
            <li>Love it, like another user I noticed a difference within the first few days of washing 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>With being consistent with my routine, my chin is completely cleared up...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting adult onset acne lately and have been searching for a good product that is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I probably had less the three pimples there, but after using the product, the area under my chin breaks out more.</li>
            <li>I like it because it doesnt dry out your face like those cheap ones you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>You can find similar products in larger sizes for better prices.</li>
            <li>and this particular products described all the problems I was having with my acne at age 27.</li>
            <li>The clay mask and gel are my favorite (second and third to the cleanser).</li>
            <li>These products keep any breakouts that do happen tiny, and makes them go away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the highly recommended and cheaper options.</li>
            <li>I love this little kit.</li>
            <li>This is the only face cleansing system that keeps my face clean and clear of a lot of acne.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>This product really works for adult breakouts.</li>
            <li>It absolutely handled my adult acne problems, which occurred after I stopped taking birth control pills.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a couple extra dollars to ensure that</li>
            <li>Works like a charm in getting the blemish to go away a lot sooner than it normally would take.</li>
            <li>I have normal to sometimes cominbation skin.</li>
            <li>: I use this on my trouble area every night, I can&#x27;t confidently say that I see or feel a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it under my normal concealer.</li>
            <li>It will dry a blemish right up!</li>
            <li>I feel that I look more like an adult, less of a teenager.  </li>
            <li>A month ago, I tried a new aesthetician and she recommended these products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(-3) stars: although the package came shrink wrapped to appear as if it was brand new, I was sent used product.</li>
            <li>its new and untampered with.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and gentle on the skin, but definitely clears breakouts and acne.</li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had some pretty big ones too.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product , it seem to be working , I have some acne last week and there are gone , Will buy from this company again</li>
            <li>or so I was breaking out, more than I usually would have...</li>
            <li>I break out from stress frequently and this had changed my skin in just a week!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Mattifier is fantastic, it keeps the oil level down, no shiny face, and my makeup isn&#x27;t slip-sliding everywhere.  </li>
            <li>For the rest of my face, the product actually inhibits the breakouts or minimizes the bumps very significantly depending on the severity of the acne as influenced by monthly hormonal changes and other factors.</li>
            <li>I didnt have a lot a acne or skin issues to begin with (mostly near my cheeks) but it did clear all my blemishes and lighted my skin!</li>
            <li>The other over night gel is cool</li>
            <li>I wear full coverage foundation daily for 10+ hours and was having a hard time keeping my skin clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I have used a variety of cleansers that have been too harsh or too mild.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it helping clear blemishes</li>
            <li>I have tried everything in the store to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>Yay my skin is clear again</li>
            <li>It gives me the feeling that it should clear up your face over night and thats not the case.</li>
            <li>It even started to clear under the skin bumps.</li>
            <li>and I am sensitive to alot of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter who thought she might like it.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur Gross-Smelling Spot Treatment Thing - Least favorite</li>
            <li>I also have developed scars from the cystic acne.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t that much of the product, but you only need to use pea size.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and my skin is oily.</li>
            <li>would repurchase this mini set from Ulta or directly from the dermalogica website.</li>
            <li>In my early twenties, I remembered this being a miracle cleanser that hooked up clear skin practically over night.</li>
            <li>However, as an adult with menstrual acne, I noticed that it didnt work as well as I remembered.</li>
            <li>I am 28 and have tried all sorts of products to help with my adult acne.</li>
            <li>After having kids my face turned into what I remember as an early teenager.  </li>
            <li>I have been struggling with adult acne for a while now and nothing seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a product that agreed so much with my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Im in my early 20s</li>
            <li>have been smaller and go away much faster.</li>
            <li>The texture reminds me a bit of snot (gross I know), but the nice thing is a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks I used the whole kit as directed.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is the only decent product in this set.</li>
            <li>I dont really use any other products in the kit so this review is mainly for the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I discovered this product when i went to a high end salon to get a facial.</li>
            <li>I do not want to blame it solely on the item because I know that diet plays a major part in the affect of acne to the skin</li>
            <li>It only took a few days off this product and back to my original product to clear my face again.</li>
            <li>It is healing all of the old zits and it&#x27;s actually starting to help my skin tone (I have sunspots and scarring).  </li>
            <li>I stopped the regimen and went back to my old skin care system.</li>
            <li>Will not try this product in the near future...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>Background: I&#x27;m 30 years old, never had a pimple problem until recently.</li>
            <li>I still get breakouts, but they are small and really I am probably the only one who is aware of them.</li>
            <li>All of my little pimples cleared right up</li>
            <li>: The big breakouts are not happening, and the red scars are fading-I&#x27;ve had 3 new pimples in the month I&#x27;ve been using this -they</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, also they do not leave my skin feeling greasy or as if my skin did not get clean.</li>
            <li>, they are travel size so they are super small.</li>
            <li>If you have mild acne problems, this might work, but I would consider my skin worse than mild at the time of trying this and had to turn to other avenues.</li>
            <li>Along with these new breakouts, I have experienced red, painful breakouts, and large cystic acne in my usual areas.</li>
            <li>I still have the red marks left from the acne, and hopefully, this will have a chance to clear up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even though I did this, I would still break out with a new zit just about every single day.  </li>
            <li>The facial cleanser was only half full and all the tubes had obviously been tampered with prior.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would clear my face up for a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale this time of year so, and since I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on my face</li>
            <li>The face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and the overnight gel seems to be keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li>Those have since healed, however I have developed new ones, and therefore after all this trouble I feel that this product is not for me.</li>
            <li>The rest are tiny, and I mean, barely a week or two worth.</li>
            <li>It may be a little expensive for the dermalogica, but it takes forever to get through a whole bottle since you only need less than a dime sized amount to get a good cleaning going.</li>

            <li> but it did make my face smooth and helped my make up go on Perfect and stay all day!</li>
            <li> The night gel is good though.</li>
            <li> LOVED it from day 1.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have a flawless, smooth finish after applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I dont think the name \\&quot;over night\\&quot; is a good name.</li>
            <li> BUT the mattifer if you have oily skins work really good.</li>
            <li> to recap - love, love, love!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought this and gave it a try, saved me lots of cash.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I now have a respectful understanding of what others who chronically suffer from acne are going through!   </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> love this product and am hooked!</li>
            <li> the first thing a person sees, and you need to put your best face forward all the time.</li>
            <li> First time I can say I have beautiful skin!  </li>
            <li> I did not get amazing results</li>
            <li> Amazing............................:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and does everything I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> But the clay mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kit before and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> product is amazing</li>
            <li> She gave me some samples to try and I liked the feel of the products.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of products</li>
            <li> It cleans nicely</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!</li>
            <li> The Dermalogica products were recommended to me by a make up artist who said it was the best line out there for adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and ive been told that to maintain a good complexion for years to come--it is important to start at my age.</li>
            <li> experienced purging for the first couple days of using this product.</li>
            <li> Good way to sample before buying full size.</li>
            <li> I am also lucky in that the spot treatment is fairly close to my skintone.  </li>
            <li> favorite items in the kit is the cleanser very light.</li>
            <li> This product felt amazing on my skin, the day and night creams are both very light and comfortable</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> My face felt like oily with it but oddly more acne...</li>
            <li> The only product in this kit that I would buy again is the CLearing Mattifier, I didn&#x27;t have an effect on my acne, but it&#x27;s basically a make up primer, and it&#x27;s probably the best primer</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve taken the mattifier out of my routine and my face is clearing up rapidly and the oilyness is getting better too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle worker, eliminating many of my zits overnight.  </li>
            <li> I had ok results with the product, some of them worked better than others.</li>
            <li> This product helped my skin feel better and my acne cleared up.</li>
            <li> I expect she will buy more.  </li>
            <li> However, it did nothing more than what we have purchased in the stores</li>
            <li> I have used Dermalogica products for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the overnight clearing gel and clearing spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> This product broke my face out even more than it already was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking most of the products.</li>
            <li> Now my acne is not completly cleared up but it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Gel - FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> feeling from the face wash which I love.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because I really enjoyed the concealer spot treatment, as well as the clearing mask.</li>
            <li> The clearing mask is cooling and refreshing, while the concealer did work well as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love a scrub and wish this kit came with a scrub, instead of foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I should have read the sizes better.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and I did not use it on most of my neck.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> but I had so many of them along with whiteheads all over my face.</li>
            <li> The overnight clearing gel is okay, but the concealing spot treatment didn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and my skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li> The a skin clearing gel was my favorite--</li>
            <li> Thought it would help with breakouts but seem to get more.</li>
            <li> The tone is more even, for sure.</li>
            <li> Will I buy more?</li>
            <li> spf15 face lotion, and then spot treat with the concealer (that I wont buy more of once its out) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the product, I feel with this kit</li>
            <li> and I think created more problems.</li>
            <li> I really love dermalogica products, the skin mattifier makes a smooth surface for makeup!</li>
            <li> I am not using the face mask in this kit - I am in love with a separate sulfur mask that works better at reducing oil and redness.</li>
            <li> And I use the overnight cleaner all over my face, my face feels very fresh when I go to bed at night!  </li>
            <li> Great product - highly recommend for people over 30 with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I had never had many days of smooth skin, but some days of the month, my skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Results are awesome.....have not seen a huge breakout yet :)</li>
            <li> The service was great and it got here pretty fast!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist referred me for a quick consultation with her!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had clear skin for the first time since before pre-teen years and it makes me feel so great that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to wear makeup now :)</li>
            <li> The Clearing Mattifier is also really nice and gets absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for about a month now and have noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> This system is different as it doesn&#x27;t come with a toner or moisturizer like others but it still worked great</li>
            <li> wish they were bigger because they are great products.</li>
            <li> Great as a spot treatment, and not overdrying if used on the entire face.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel smooth after using but has not helped the acne at all.</li>
            <li> I was the fortunate one who never had acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li> I am even comfortable going without makeup.</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had amazing skin, maybe a zit here and there</li>
            <li> Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] and have found the combination to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> The color matches my lightly tanned Asian skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li> I work out just about every day and make sure to wash my face right after.  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> The overnight gel also does a great job of calming down my skin at night for a refreshing look in the morning.</li>
            <li> but if I was rich I would have this for work when I was feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;Tinted</li>
            <li> Ideally I would love to stick with my old skin system, and use the clearing mattifier on my t-zone, just for the extra oil control, not to rely on as a breakout reducer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this trial pack to try and am now a believer and will continue to use this as long as I need too and can.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
            <li> But I was really pleased with the results after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now to work on stopping the acne in the first place :)</li>
            <li> I know the products here are pricey, and I like keeping my money, but sometimes you just have to realize you are worth it!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about the wash, but a tiny pea amount at a time washes nicely!  </li>
            <li> I see great results and love that my skin does not get dried out.</li>
            <li> I have been complimented on my clear glowing skin and i couldnt be more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome for me because I dont really use the other products that often.</li>
            <li> I received this product on Friday and started using it right away, because my skin has been out of control!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good brand with a lot of unique good products, but as a consumer who didn&#x27;t go to skin school, you&#x27;re not going to know better about what products will work for you (and they&#x27;re expensive).</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this Set to give the products a trial run before dumping hundreds of dollars on the full size product line.</li>
            <li> Overall a good value if u want to do a test run.</li>
            <li> A toner would be a nice addition to the kit, I am surprised that it doesn&#x27;t include one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser - Fairly basic, fairly drying.</li>
            <li> A product can only do so much and a body still needs care for good or better skin to result.</li>
            <li> AND the products I received were used and not even full.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased any full sized products yet</li>
            <li> It has ingredients that gives your face a cool and tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> and I would rather make the investment in the full size instead of wasting 40 bucks on an incomplete set.</li>
            <li> To have good skin health it is recommended to have a moisturizer which is used after the washing of the face and there is only a sample in the set.</li>
            <li> Overall good products.</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne, which is VERY hard to treat, so I am very pleased that this product line was so successful.</li>
            <li> seems like nice product but my skin is very oily and apparently needs more medication, as I broke out while using this-</li>
            <li> But I have been experimenting, and added in other products which seems to be working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I truly love this and believe in it so far!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work!!</li>
            <li> (Also use the Zeno hot spot for those spot treatments too, which with this works wonders!</li>
            <li> - it produces results, my face is clear!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t sleep much, the product helps a lot to inhibit the intensity of breakouts, but my skin won&#x27;t be as smooth as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the line itself is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t&#x27; really notice any difference in the oil control on my face, or much change in acne, but my face &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any moisturizers by Dermologica only because the one I have works great for me, Ambi Even and Clear with SPF 35</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 30 days and have seen breakouts in areas I rarely ever broke out in before (cheeks, neck,).</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the</li>
            <li> the morning, instead of using the wash on my face, I&#x27;m washing/rinsing only with warm water.</li>
            <li> and it made my face more clear</li>
            <li> I am 23 with oily skin and thinking this just isn&#x27;t the right combination of products for me.</li>
            <li> no results right away.</li>
            <li> ... It was a realy good choice works well not that expensive and its so easy to use :) :</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but after 48hrs I can definitely see what my husband noticed the first day only better!</li>
            <li> I started using this right away and within the first month noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product, she says its just OK, it works kind of slow.</li>
            <li> These products left my face feeling smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, and right now I am dealing with more breakouts than I have ever EVER had in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Very much like the description of cystic acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the overnight treatment, but it does help and for me, every little bit that helps, is blessing.</li>
            <li> An added bonus of this line is that my pores are significantly smaller than before and are better than they ever have been, regardless of the product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My husband noticed a difference within the first 24hrs.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied though.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried the acne kit.  </li>
            <li> Mask - Second favorite in the kit.</li>
            <li> Of course, I see better results when used daily.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Dermalogica</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy that it at least seemed to help so</li>
            <li> do recommend this product and to give it about a week to start seeing first results.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I want to see if I can get more product with similar ingedients for a similar price.</li>
            <li> In Clinique doesn&#x27;t work, I will definitely go for Dermalogica because it makes my skin much better.</li>
            <li> Help with the oil at first, but then my skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I can only hope that their skin responds better to this product than mine did.</li>
            <li> About two weeks in, my skin is clear and smooth just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I noticed the seal/ sticker at the top of the box was already cut open after removing the shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> I just buy the big bottle of the cleanser because I use that most</li>
            <li> I noticed that the first week</li>
            <li> AFTER this first week or so, it cleared up.</li>
            <li> Many different products to try before you buy.  </li>
            <li> I now feel soooo confident after just a week of only the face wash.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the extra stress set off my skin.</li>
            <li> Also too many steps to do especially since it&#x27;s not helping.</li>
            <li> Nice kit, still the size of the products is minimal.</li>
            <li> Dried out all my existing acne and has done a good job at preventing .</li>
            <li> I have do know that some acne products warn that the skin may get worse before it gets better, but I do want to find an acne regimen that will clear my skin of acne, blemishes/acne scars, shrink pores, eliminate oily skin and give me a nice even tone that&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> , I love the way this feels going on, and my skin feels smooth and soft all day long</li>
            <li> I feel like because I dont use the little bottles very often, its definately a good bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> It leaves a persons skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> only gave this system 4 stars only because at the beginning it is drying but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I switched to the medibac kit out of curiosity from all of the positive things I have seen and heard about the dermalogica brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne pretty much since I stopped birth control.</li>
            <li> I usually have a good amount of break outs during my period, so I am dealing with hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> I seriously recommend avoiding the eye zone, because the Salicylic acid is more concentrated than most store products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry out my skin like most acne meds.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and this kit has lasted me over a month with a lot left!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; products, so don&#x27;t expect anything large to come your way.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Ance treatment but they sent me Age Smart</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dermalogica is the first product that actually made a significant difference to my skin I used it for about two months.</li>
            <li> The two main things I will continue to keep are the clearing mattifier and the concealing spot treatment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; it keeps my acne at bay, but Mary Kay not only is a little better, it makes my skin softer and gives it a healthier look than this product.  </li>
            <li> I have never broken out the way I do now.</li>
            <li> am very plesed with this product...</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying the the cleanser, clarifying mat cream, and overnight clearing gel.....</li>
            <li> I really hoped it would have helped</li>
            <li> I still use my normal face cleanser first and the follow-up with the cleanser in this kit using one of those circulating scrubbing brushes.</li>
            <li> I kept using it until my unusual breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin, you will need to wash your face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s entirety before really making a decision on wether or not it is working for you.</li>
            <li> I will not knock this product as a whole because this could just be my skin not agreeing with it.</li>
            <li> I go to bed with a light coat of the masque on the pimple and it is much smaller in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so much smoother after I picked at all the blackheads.</li>
            <li> I dont use the mask and gel (or others listed) very often--maybe once a week, once every two weeks maybe (??).</li>
            <li> so i dont use those products very often.</li>
            <li> I really like the clearing skin wash, clearing mattifier, and the sebum clearing masque.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
            <li> In desperation I bought this because my whole face was broke out.</li>
            <li> but this set absolutely worked.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Clogged my pores resulting in blackheads everywhere - very drying, made my skin flake and itch.</li>
            <li> I am about ready to order another.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this based on reviews, I really like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the overnight gel really does anything.</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t have to do that whole blotting thing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different, is that it would be nice to have a moisturizer with the purchase.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been able to reduce the overall presence of my acne</li>
            <li> So, that it definitely a unique aspect of this line and a big bonus.  </li>
            <li> I would say this product works as well as many of the other products I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> and I often used other lotions on top of it anyways.</li>
            <li> Love it, like another user I noticed a difference within the first few days of washing 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> With being consistent with my routine, my chin is completely cleared up...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting adult onset acne lately and have been searching for a good product that is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> I probably had less the three pimples there, but after using the product, the area under my chin breaks out more.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesnt dry out your face like those cheap ones you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> You can find similar products in larger sizes for better prices.</li>
            <li> and this particular products described all the problems I was having with my acne at age 27.</li>
            <li> The clay mask and gel are my favorite (second and third to the cleanser).</li>
            <li> These products keep any breakouts that do happen tiny, and makes them go away quickly.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the highly recommended and cheaper options.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cleansing system that keeps my face clean and clear of a lot of acne.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> This product really works for adult breakouts.</li>
            <li> It absolutely handled my adult acne problems, which occurred after I stopped taking birth control pills.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a couple extra dollars to ensure that</li>
            <li> Works like a charm in getting the blemish to go away a lot sooner than it normally would take.</li>
            <li> I have normal to sometimes cominbation skin.</li>
            <li> : I use this on my trouble area every night, I can&#x27;t confidently say that I see or feel a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it under my normal concealer.</li>
            <li> It will dry a blemish right up!</li>
            <li> I feel that I look more like an adult, less of a teenager.  </li>
            <li> A month ago, I tried a new aesthetician and she recommended these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(-3) stars: although the package came shrink wrapped to appear as if it was brand new, I was sent used product.</li>
            <li> its new and untampered with.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and gentle on the skin, but definitely clears breakouts and acne.</li>
            <li> I have always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had some pretty big ones too.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product , it seem to be working , I have some acne last week and there are gone , Will buy from this company again</li>
            <li> or so I was breaking out, more than I usually would have...</li>
            <li> I break out from stress frequently and this had changed my skin in just a week!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Mattifier is fantastic, it keeps the oil level down, no shiny face, and my makeup isn&#x27;t slip-sliding everywhere.  </li>
            <li> For the rest of my face, the product actually inhibits the breakouts or minimizes the bumps very significantly depending on the severity of the acne as influenced by monthly hormonal changes and other factors.</li>
            <li> I didnt have a lot a acne or skin issues to begin with (mostly near my cheeks) but it did clear all my blemishes and lighted my skin!</li>
            <li> The other over night gel is cool</li>
            <li> I wear full coverage foundation daily for 10+ hours and was having a hard time keeping my skin clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I have used a variety of cleansers that have been too harsh or too mild.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it helping clear blemishes</li>
            <li> I have tried everything in the store to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Yay my skin is clear again</li>
            <li> It gives me the feeling that it should clear up your face over night and thats not the case.</li>
            <li> It even started to clear under the skin bumps.</li>
            <li> and I am sensitive to alot of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter who thought she might like it.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur Gross-Smelling Spot Treatment Thing - Least favorite</li>
            <li> I also have developed scars from the cystic acne.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t that much of the product, but you only need to use pea size.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> would repurchase this mini set from Ulta or directly from the dermalogica website.</li>
            <li> In my early twenties, I remembered this being a miracle cleanser that hooked up clear skin practically over night.</li>
            <li> However, as an adult with menstrual acne, I noticed that it didnt work as well as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I am 28 and have tried all sorts of products to help with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> After having kids my face turned into what I remember as an early teenager.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with adult acne for a while now and nothing seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a product that agreed so much with my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Im in my early 20s</li>
            <li> have been smaller and go away much faster.</li>
            <li> The texture reminds me a bit of snot (gross I know), but the nice thing is a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks I used the whole kit as directed.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is the only decent product in this set.</li>
            <li> I dont really use any other products in the kit so this review is mainly for the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when i went to a high end salon to get a facial.</li>
            <li> I do not want to blame it solely on the item because I know that diet plays a major part in the affect of acne to the skin</li>
            <li> It only took a few days off this product and back to my original product to clear my face again.</li>
            <li> It is healing all of the old zits and it&#x27;s actually starting to help my skin tone (I have sunspots and scarring).  </li>
            <li> I stopped the regimen and went back to my old skin care system.</li>
            <li> Will not try this product in the near future...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Background: I&#x27;m 30 years old, never had a pimple problem until recently.</li>
            <li> I still get breakouts, but they are small and really I am probably the only one who is aware of them.</li>
            <li> All of my little pimples cleared right up</li>
            <li> : The big breakouts are not happening, and the red scars are fading-I&#x27;ve had 3 new pimples in the month I&#x27;ve been using this -they</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, also they do not leave my skin feeling greasy or as if my skin did not get clean.</li>
            <li> , they are travel size so they are super small.</li>
            <li> If you have mild acne problems, this might work, but I would consider my skin worse than mild at the time of trying this and had to turn to other avenues.</li>
            <li> Along with these new breakouts, I have experienced red, painful breakouts, and large cystic acne in my usual areas.</li>
            <li> I still have the red marks left from the acne, and hopefully, this will have a chance to clear up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even though I did this, I would still break out with a new zit just about every single day.  </li>
            <li> The facial cleanser was only half full and all the tubes had obviously been tampered with prior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would clear my face up for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale this time of year so, and since I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on my face</li>
            <li> The face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and the overnight gel seems to be keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> Those have since healed, however I have developed new ones, and therefore after all this trouble I feel that this product is not for me.</li>
            <li> The rest are tiny, and I mean, barely a week or two worth.</li>
            <li> It may be a little expensive for the dermalogica, but it takes forever to get through a whole bottle since you only need less than a dime sized amount to get a good cleaning going.</li>
            <li> It might be useful in other cases, but my acne is stronger than the little percentage of Salicylic Acid in this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is this product or Dermalogica&#x27;s Anti Bac Wash, but the big pores on my nose have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I completely cleared my acne with natural products like raw honey and aloe vera.</li>
            <li> But it never dried my face out like other well known acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to spend full price for huge bottles of crap</li>
            <li> The only thing I was a little put out about is that it was supposed to be brand new, but everything was opened.</li>
            <li> Again, I really wanted to like this product, after all the positive things I&#x27;ve heard, but I just think I have a difficult skin type to treat.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bottles are small, but you don&#x27;t need to use much at all.</li>
            <li> Made it to a month, saw a little difference, but I was still getting new breakouts...</li>
            <li> I mean literally covering my entire chin area with large acne.</li>
            <li> I will not continue using this once the breakout is completely gone because it&#x27;s probably too harsh for non-acne skin, but I will definitely use this whenever I have a break out.</li>
            <li> Within just a few days my skin was completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I also like that this skincare line was specifically designed for adult skin, and salicylic acid was not as harsh a concentration as what you find in the drugstores, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> your face is not naturally very oily, I recommend ordering the moisturizing lotion too because they only have a sample packet in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And lastly, I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to find something other than drug store products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and EXTREMELY oily skin for the last 30 of my 42 years</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t get all greasy and shiny through out the day like other products had left it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> My skin also became extremely oily during the initial use.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin still felt dry after I used it</li>
            <li> : My skin did get dry with the 2 uses a day as recommended.</li>
            <li> My thought on this was that I&#x27;d rather deal with dry skin than zits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to be working well for me, and it has reduced the dry skin issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely even break out, and if I do, it&#x27;ll be one tiny spot that usually goes away within a day or two.</li>
            <li> My skin was shiny (oily) and every single pore was visible - felt like from space - but this line worked almost from day one.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, and I usually use Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li> My face felt soft after use and some of the acne went away, however in the last week or so my acne has actually gotten MUCH WORSE.</li>
            <li> Even the scarring from previous blemishes is starting to lighten up!  </li>
            <li> noticed that if I get lazy and dont wash my face daily (twice a day on the days I work out), I break out instantly.</li>
            <li> I know that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better, but I had to run out and get back to my old system before my skin got any worse!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone older who suffers as I did from breakouts and oiliness.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin fairly clear, or at least less oily for the following days.&lt;br /&gt;Matte</li>
            <li> and they are not just little pimples they are larger and more painful.</li>
            <li> My skin has had a few issues in last couple of years</li>
            <li> I have not experienced cystic acne like this since I was in junior high!</li>
            <li> Did not deliver expected results.</li>
            <li> Spent $50 again.</li>
            <li> only use the face wash once a day my skin was getting really dried out.</li>
            <li> The mattifying product was slick and greasy and never really dried down.</li>
            <li> I noticed that although I had such terrible breakouts, the entire root of the pimples and blackheads came out very, very easy when I picked at them ( I know I shouldn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I generally have relatively clear skin, but was unhappy with the tiny bumps I had all over.</li>
            <li> I am now almost 40.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself though, a little does go a long way, and came exactly as advertised, so I don&#x27;t feel as if I got dealt a bad product.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I developed adult acne very bad on my entire jawline after pregnancy and needed something to clear it up, as it was still lingering even 6 weeks after delivery.</li>
            <li> The other products I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> it helped my acne compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other products and this one helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> like i have felt from other products.  </li>
            <li> Cleared up my face quicker than other acne products I was using.</li>
            <li> It dries on my skin and dosnt blend in with my other foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is entirely because of the product</li>
            <li> Before using this product I only broke out once a month, never more.</li>
            <li> I will say that despite the small size of the bottles that the product does in fact last quite a while.</li>
            <li> like this cleanser counter to the other ones Dermalogica sells.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;oil control lotion\\&quot; is a small packet, not a bottle similar to the rest of the product.</li>
            <li> I have always had big pores on my nose and it is a  surprise for me to see them so small.</li>
            <li> This is probably the biggest disappointment with the kit, it&#x27;s one of the crappy paper-type pouches, and only gives you a few applications worth of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found what works for me, and I hope this review helps other people.</li>
            <li> The other products irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Adult acne is awful, even more so when you never had it as a teenager.</li>
            <li> The pimples I was getting were big, red, deep, painful, and leaving red scars.</li>
            <li> , they recommend to use it a few times a week, and again -a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too dark for my skin and no amount of blending with my makeup works.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is the size of each iteM.  </li>
            <li> the foundation trial is too dark</li>
            <li> , this item smells like a fart, doesn&#x27;t help acne, is two shades too dark for me (they don&#x27;t give you choices), and is meant for &amp;#34;during day&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I seen zero improvement and for the price it was totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> Twice in the past month I had a painful bump emerge under my skin, with this and the Zeno, it shrunk, disappeared, never turned into anything more.  </li>
            <li> the visible pimples had dried up while the ones under my skin were minimal.  </li>
            <li> Well it is now Sunday, I have used this product a total of 4 times and the results are UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping that this will finally help me out, at least for a little while.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more of it soon, regardless of the cost, because this brand is horribly overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I like about half of the products...</li>
            <li> , I am hopeful that it will begin clearing up and start making my breakouts less.</li>
            <li> It was my understanding that this product was supposed to help stop the oily skin issue, this has exacerbated my slightly oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As some users have said, it appears travel size or less.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did or used, my skin has just been a mess.</li>
            <li> The face wash was definitely not full either.</li>
            <li> Also when I wash my face I don&#x27;t feel that tight skin feeling or dryness</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dark, but goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t actually conceal</li>
            <li> I also wish that the concealing spot treatment was a little bit lighter in color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - This \\&quot;travel kit\\&quot; lasts a little longer than a month if you use the amount recommended.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, I&#x27;m one of the very few that can even use it and it does work well.  </li>
            <li> but it only kept getting worse</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; get the cover-up to apply well, threw it out after trying a few times.</li>
            <li> It made my skin ten times worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I skipped a few days and did wind up with a bump or two.</li>
            <li> Test product before using before you waste your money.</li>
            <li> A waste of $100....</li>
            <li> and I have had a few bumps still pop up.  </li>
            <li> Never was it harsh on my skin or over drying.</li>
            <li> They were too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but my skin broke out worse than ever and in places where I&#x27;ve never had acne after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> When you are done with the day, your face is 2 or 3 times less oilier than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to Murad and it seems to be working well at half the price!</li>
            <li> Less breakouts over all!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure the spot concealer worked, but perhaps it did a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money, the product is small and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It immediately got rid of the unusual painful bumps that started to invade my skin.</li>
            <li> She told me it was going to get worst before it gets better</li>
            <li> The packaging is small, but I have been using it for over 2 months and haven&#x27;t run out yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you should also know this is really a small tester kit-</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it IS expensive</li>
            <li> The products were small, travel size items.</li>
            <li> This kit is a bit on small side</li>
            <li> Tried two other expensive products and both left me broken out with acne.</li>
            <li> Less red, less painful, the pimples were going away without coming to a head, so</li>
            <li> A little disappointing that only one of them had the foil seal still attached.</li>
            <li> The spots were still there but not imflamed  and after putting my makeup on you could hardly tell I had acne.</li>
            <li> so I can hardly tell it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have perfectly clear skin, but my skin seems to be at a balance, where things are not as bad as they can get at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always have at least one pimple to contend with.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;, but then again, I&#x27;ve never liked any cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used really.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> I washed my face with the product at least two times a day.</li>
            <li> It looks like that weird gel thats in baby diapers once it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I was having an adult hormonal breakout that resulted in painful pimples.  </li>
            <li> acne sucks</li>
            <li> However, the small bottels have lasted over a month!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because they are too expensive!  </li>
            <li> Not an uncomfortable burning sensation like some other products.</li>
            <li> (in a matter of days has gotten rid of redness and excessive oil on my face!)  </li>
            <li> Very small kit didn&#x27;t realize that when.just bought it</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t go away, it seriously made me want to never look in the mirror again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad my skin has been, and she only uses Dermalogica products on her clients.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this crap, go natural ur skin will thank you</li>
            <li> I however am not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of looking like someone who just doesn&#x27;t take care of their skin at all.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that I tired it</li>
            <li> but my acne got SO much worse</li>
            <li> I felt like my skin was so much worse than it had been before.</li>
            <li> All of the products I see at the store for acne dried me out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Used for two weeks - was supposed to help with skin congestion, pores, t-zone, etc - made all of these issues worse.</li>
            <li> and then it gets a million billion times worse.</li>
            <li> My acne got worse and worse and my skin&#x27;s oilyness also got worse.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a horrible diet for the past two weeks with not much water (sad, I know).</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I used it during the summer because I started to get very bad breakouts that were unusually painful perhaps because of my age and the season.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about acne cleansing systems.</li>
            <li> I was never plagued by horrible acne in my teens, aside from occasional blemishes, however now in my mid-thirties</li>
            <li> The price was outrageous for the size, this kit will not even last for a two week trip.</li>
            <li> And as I wrote before this product left me with some of the worst acne that I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> And the mattifier feels weird.</li>
            <li> My acne actually got worst.</li>
            <li> I started using this as recommended by the pamphlet included with the kit, which was in the troubled areas (my forehead)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I went online to return item this Seller does not accept returns.</li>
            <li> Horrible, i wish  i could get my money back.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately things did not go as well-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very frustrating being almost 30 and still having acne.</li>
            <li> and then my skin went crazy again.  </li>
            <li> but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> It had caused me to break out horribly in the past.</li>
            <li> I even bought very expensive Vichy, Clarins and Clinique - nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with this product...tried everything else you can think of including face wash from my dermatologist that was $$$$$$.  </li>
            <li> I noramlly have really bad burning with the sacylic acid medicine</li>
            <li> Had to quit using it after 2 weeks because it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> Since the product seems to attack the acne and prevent it from getting as bad as it could get.</li>
            <li> so it smelled really bad and gave me headaches.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad and continuous that I could feel the bumps under my skin that hadn&#x27;t surfaced.  </li>
            <li> Is that too hard to ask for?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> but I guess it is not for me. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become very painful acne all over my chin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the seller.</li>
            <li> and I have tried all the over the counter stuff as well as going to a dermatologist who gave me retin-a which made my skin even worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bottles are tiny.  This product is a rip off and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  You can find similar products in larger sizes for better prices.</li>
            <li> Love this. You get A LOT of product...I have had my set for three months now and I still have tons left. I see great results and love that my skin does not get dried out. I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> Product as described. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This product felt amazing on my skin, the day and night creams are both very light and comfortable but my skin broke out worse than ever and in places where I&#x27;ve never had acne after only a few days of use. I stuck it out another 2 weeks but it only kept getting worse so I&#x27;ve give. Up on it. My face felt like oily with it but oddly more acne...</li>
            <li> The Dermalogica products were recommended to me by a make up artist who said it was the best line out there for adult acne prone skin. I decided to buy this Set to give the products a trial run before dumping hundreds of dollars on the full size product line. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this and gave it a try, saved me lots of cash. It really wasn&#x27;t effective for my skin. I can&#x27;t say the line itself is worth the money. however, i know people who swear by Dermalogica, so if you want to try out the Medibac line, i would buy this kit and give it a shot. The only product in this kit that I would buy again is the CLearing Mattifier, I didn&#x27;t have an effect on my acne, but it&#x27;s basically a make up primer, and it&#x27;s probably the best primer Ive used to date. I didn&#x27;t think it helping clear blemishes but it did make my face smooth and helped my make up go on Perfect and stay all day! Helps me stay non greasy also. The other products I will not purchase again. Overall a good value if u want to do a test run.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been clearer since I&#x27;ve used this face wash!</li>
            <li> This product was great it helped my acne compared to other products. The service was great and it got here pretty fast!</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks I used the whole kit as directed.  My acne got worse and worse and my skin&#x27;s oilyness also got worse.  Finally, I started eliminating one item at a time and discovered that my skin did not like the mattifier.  Now, I&#x27;ve taken the mattifier out of my routine and my face is clearing up rapidly and the oilyness is getting better too.  The very best part of this kit, for me, is the overnight treatment.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker, eliminating many of my zits overnight.  Will definitely buy more of it soon, regardless of the cost, because this brand is horribly overpriced.  But I&#x27;ve tried everything in the drug store and Proactiv and acne.com.  Both Proactiv and Acne.com products worked for a while and then my skin went crazy again.  I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and EXTREMELY oily skin for the last 30 of my 42 years so I&#x27;m hoping that this will finally help me out, at least for a little while.  I&#x27;m tired of looking like someone who just doesn&#x27;t take care of their skin at all.  An added bonus of this line is that my pores are significantly smaller than before and are better than they ever have been, regardless of the product I&#x27;ve used.  So, that it definitely a unique aspect of this line and a big bonus.  I am also lucky in that the spot treatment is fairly close to my skintone.  From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, I&#x27;m one of the very few that can even use it and it does work well.  It&#x27;s not as good as the overnight treatment, but it does help and for me, every little bit that helps, is blessing.</li>
            <li> I had ok results with the product, some of them worked better than others. I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; get the cover-up to apply well, threw it out after trying a few times. The mask, didn&#x27;t like it at all and didn&#x27;t see any difference. The over night clearing gel, matte, face wash, and the oil control lotion, I did like. I have also just started using the clay wash. I have to say I didn&#x27;t&#x27; really notice any difference in the oil control on my face, or much change in acne, but my face &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift.  She informed me that she has been using the product regularly and likes the results.</li>
            <li> This product helped my skin feel better and my acne cleared up. I have used a lot of other products and this one helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter.  She loves it.  I expect she will buy more.  Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about acne cleansing systems. I also only use the benzol peroxide type of acne cleansers. This system comes with sacylic acide treatment but I decided to give this system a try anyway. I noramlly have really bad burning with the sacylic acid medicine but this one did not bother me at all. Literally with in 5 days my acne break out was gone. I had some pretty big ones too. I was so suprised. There was no burning or scaley skin either. This system is different as it doesn&#x27;t come with a toner or moisturizer like others but it still worked great and I am sensitive to alot of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite items in the kit is the cleanser very light. You do not need to use a lot. The overnight clearing gel is great too. There is a spot treatment that you can like use during the day but I only use it at night because I have brown skin and it will look like a have a dry/ ashy spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this system 4 stars only because at the beginning it is drying but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. I don&#x27;t use any moisturizers by Dermologica only because the one I have works great for me, Ambi Even and Clear with SPF 35 ( I think it&#x27;s 35).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to test drive the system this is great. You don&#x27;t want to spend full price for huge bottles of crap you discover you don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I would say this product works as well as many of the other products I have tried over the years. I did not get amazing results but I did see some improvement.</li>
            <li> It made my skin ten times worse.</li>
            <li> I model part time and I need my skin to look its best and I tend to get a lot of  break outs in my breadline and they are not just little pimples they are larger and more painful. My skin has had a few issues in last couple of years and I have tried all the over the counter stuff as well as going to a dermatologist who gave me retin-a which made my skin even worst. She told me it was going to get worst before it gets better and it ruined my skin and I stuck with it for months. Finally I after seeing Dermalogica at the place I get my hair done i thought id look it up and this particular products described all the problems I was having with my acne at age 27. I have only been using it 4 days and with in those 4 days all the acne I had is literally gone and my skin doesn&#x27;t get all greasy and shiny through out the day like other products had left it. Also when I wash my face I don&#x27;t feel that tight skin feeling or dryness like i have felt from other products.  Already ordered some of the products !</li>
            <li> I received this product on Friday and started using it right away, because my skin has been out of control! I was never plagued by horrible acne in my teens, aside from occasional blemishes, however now in my mid-thirties my face looks like I&#x27;m going through puberty! I now have a respectful understanding of what others who chronically suffer from acne are going through!   I have always had very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to use a product with salicylic acid in it. It had caused me to break out horribly in the past. I was at my hair salon last week where an aesthetician also provides skin care. My hair stylist referred me for a quick consultation with her! That&#x27;s how bad my skin has been, and she only uses Dermalogica products on her clients. She gave me some samples to try and I liked the feel of the products. I also like that this skincare line was specifically designed for adult skin, and salicylic acid was not as harsh a concentration as what you find in the drugstores, so I decided to give it a try.  Well it is now Sunday, I have used this product a total of 4 times and the results are UNBELIEVABLE! My skin has already so dramatically improved that if I wasn&#x27;t actually experiencing it, I might not believe it. My husband noticed a difference within the first 24hrs. He said that the areas that did have acne appeared to be flattening out. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but after 48hrs I can definitely see what my husband noticed the first day only better! My t-zone has been the problem area, and in 48hrs, 75% of the blemishes are gone! Even the scarring from previous blemishes is starting to lighten up!  I&#x27;m sold on this product! It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I have used just about everything for my acne.  I am 29 and I have dealt with acne since I was 12...I&#x27;ve even gone to dermatologists and nothing has seemed to work.  I decided to try this stuff just to see if it might work - I like how they offer a sample pack so you can try it without having to spend a ton of money buying each individual product.  Anyways, I started using this product Friday night.  Instantly I started seeing results.  I had a ton of whiteheads all over my face...these started diminishing.  My face felt softer and all of the zits that were currently on my face started to disappear.  I work out just about every day and make sure to wash my face right after.  Even though I did this, I would still break out with a new zit just about every single day.  Well, I have had ZERO breakouts since I started using this stuff.  It is healing all of the old zits and it&#x27;s actually starting to help my skin tone (I have sunspots and scarring).  I love this stuff!  It has truly helped me out...it&#x27;s very frustrating being almost 30 and still having acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne pretty much since I stopped birth control. No matter what I did or used, my skin has just been a mess. Some of the products I tried were Proactive and Jan Marini. This seems to be doing it for me FINALLY! My skin is clearing up beautifully and it hasn&#x27;t been a month yet.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t like the tiny size of the oil control lotion the kit provides. It&#x27;s a tiny sample size instead of bottle like everything else. I also wish that the concealing spot treatment was a little bit lighter in color. It&#x27;s too dark for my skin and no amount of blending with my makeup works. I wish they had a choice of colors on the concealer like Murad does.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is the size of each iteM.  wish they were bigger because they are great products. A toner would be a nice addition to the kit, I am surprised that it doesn&#x27;t include one. Overall satisfied though. Am definitely ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with adult acne. The stress of nursing school combined with the all nighters, took a toll on my skin. I have never broken out the way I do now. A month ago, I tried a new aesthetician and she recommended these products. I&#x27;ve been using these products for about a month now and have noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin. I barely even break out, and if I do, it&#x27;ll be one tiny spot that usually goes away within a day or two. I truly recommend this product combined with monthly facials.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, and I usually use Mary Kay products.  But since they can be hassle to get sometimes, I thought I&#x27;d try out something else that&#x27;s easier to obtain.  It&#x27;s okay; it keeps my acne at bay, but Mary Kay not only is a little better, it makes my skin softer and gives it a healthier look than this product.  I will just go back to my Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter who thought she might like it.  However, it did nothing more than what we have purchased in the stores have done for her.  Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cleansing system that keeps my face clean and clear of a lot of acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Dermalogica products for many, many years.  This is the first time I tried the acne kit.  It leaves a persons skin feeling soft and clean.  I absolutely LOVE the overnight clearing gel and clearing spot treatment.  It will dry a blemish right up!</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out even more than it already was.  Had to quit using it after 2 weeks because it was so bad.  It only took a few days off this product and back to my original product to clear my face again.</li>
            <li> I would not have ordered this had I known it was a travel size kit. The price was outrageous for the size, this kit will not even last for a two week trip.</li>
            <li> This product is great if your looking to switch to the Dermalogica MediBac line. The kit lasts about a month. I saw a difference in my skin around the second week of usage. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Cleared up my face quicker than other acne products I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking most of the products. They don&#x27;t dry out my skin like most acne meds. Good way to sample before buying full size.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I was stunned at how small the bottels were. They look like samples. However, the small bottels have lasted over a month! I realy do like the face mask. The day time acne spot treatment and concealer I am not realy fond uf. It dries on my skin and dosnt blend in with my other foundation or powder. The night gel is good though. Now my acne is not completly cleared up but it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> I finally have found a product that has cleared me up!  This stuff is so great for cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried several acne clearing products over the years...Proactive, Murad, Neutogena, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it!  I bought this trial kit based on a friends recommendation.  I am 37 with acne prone, oily skin around my chin area.  I usually have a good amount of break outs during my period, so I am dealing with hormonal acne.  I have been using the cleanser, the clarifying mat cream, and the overnight clearing gel (on acne areas only) for three weeks now.  I have also used the mask once, again, only on my chin area that is prone to acne.  With being consistent with my routine, my chin is completely cleared up...but it took three weeks!!  This has not happened in several years....I always have at least one pimple to contend with.  I still have the red marks left from the acne, and hopefully, this will have a chance to clear up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very plesed with this product...it is a goood price for what you are getting, and now I know which products to invest in.  I am approaching one month with the trial kit and still have plenty left to use.  I will absolutely be buying the the cleanser, clarifying mat cream, and overnight clearing gel.....the foundation trial is too dark and I have plenty of mask left before I would need to buy the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review before on anything I&#x27;ve ever bought, but felt like I needed to spread the word about this product - it produces results, my face is clear!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this kit interchangeably with the UltraCalming kit, and it works great.  I use the Overnight Clearing Gel every night, and the Mask every week or so, or when I break out.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my acne prone- oily skin. It was also a bit drying. I really hoped it would have helped but I guess it is not for me. :(</li>
            <li> Amazing............................:... It was a realy good choice works well not that expensive and its so easy to use :) :</li>
            <li> I like about half of the products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser - Fairly basic, fairly drying. Wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;, but then again, I&#x27;ve never liked any cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used really.&lt;br /&gt;Face Mask - Second favorite in the kit. Great as a spot treatment, and not overdrying if used on the entire face. Keeps skin fairly clear, or at least less oily for the following days.&lt;br /&gt;Matte Gel - FAVORITE. Instantly takes the oily appearance away. I looked up the full-sized item price and I would NEVER pay that, but if I was rich I would have this for work when I was feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;Tinted Sulfur Gross-Smelling Spot Treatment Thing - Least favorite, this item smells like a fart, doesn&#x27;t help acne, is two shades too dark for me (they don&#x27;t give you choices), and is meant for &amp;#34;during day&amp;#34; use but like I said, smells like a fart and I could never wear it in public.&lt;br /&gt;Gel Spot Treatment - If you&#x27;re going to use something that doesn&#x27;t help acne overnight but dries out your skin, just use the Neutrogena RapidClear and you&#x27;ll see the same results without spending $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Go to a dermatologist and ask them what products from Dermalogica would work for you. Or even the Ulta Skin Bar. They&#x27;re a good brand with a lot of unique good products, but as a consumer who didn&#x27;t go to skin school, you&#x27;re not going to know better about what products will work for you (and they&#x27;re expensive).</li>
            <li> So far I really like this kit. The face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and the overnight gel seems to be keeping my face clear. All of my little pimples cleared right up and I&#x27;ve only been using this system for a week. Haven&#x27;t tried the mask but if I re-order, I think I will stick with the face wash and overnight gel. Great product - highly recommend for people over 30 with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product , it seem to be working , I have some acne last week and there are gone , Will buy from this company again</li>
            <li> The packaging is small, but I have been using it for over 2 months and haven&#x27;t run out yet. My hormonal acne is in-check FINALLY with this. I use it with my Olay Pro-X brush and it works wonders! Great smell and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling from the face wash which I love.</li>
            <li> The cleanser for this product is great. I still use my normal face cleanser first and the follow-up with the cleanser in this kit using one of those circulating scrubbing brushes. The overnight gel also does a great job of calming down my skin at night for a refreshing look in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work!! I am 23 with oily skin and thinking this just isn&#x27;t the right combination of products for me. With the products I was using before the medibac kit, I would have the occasional breakout, maybe twice a month. I switched to the medibac kit out of curiosity from all of the positive things I have seen and heard about the dermalogica brand. I have been using these products for about 30 days and have seen breakouts in areas I rarely ever broke out in before (cheeks, neck,). Along with these new breakouts, I have experienced red, painful breakouts, and large cystic acne in my usual areas. I have not experienced cystic acne like this since I was in junior high! I also have developed scars from the cystic acne. Again, I really wanted to like this product, after all the positive things I&#x27;ve heard, but I just think I have a difficult skin type to treat. I know that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better, but I had to run out and get back to my old system before my skin got any worse!! I gave 2 stars because I really enjoyed the concealer spot treatment, as well as the clearing mask. The clearing mask is cooling and refreshing, while the concealer did work well as a spot treatment. I love a scrub and wish this kit came with a scrub, instead of foaming cleanser. The products overall worked well with controlling my oily skin. Ideally I would love to stick with my old skin system, and use the clearing mattifier on my t-zone, just for the extra oil control, not to rely on as a breakout reducer.</li>
            <li> I have seen great rules with the medibac system. Dried out all my existing acne and has done a good job at preventing . I wear full coverage foundation daily for 10+ hours and was having a hard time keeping my skin clear and blemish free. Of course, I see better results when used daily. I skipped a few days and did wind up with a bump or two. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! though on the pricey side... It takes such a small amount! The two main things I will continue to keep are the clearing mattifier and the concealing spot treatment! The clearing mattifier is like a frost for your face. You can literally sweat all day and your face will still be matte! Best stuff ever</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I tired it and it did not work for me, however, it may work for others.</li>
            <li> I researched online the best acne products for weeks. This was one of the highly recommended and cheaper options. I however am not very impressed. It does make my skin feel smooth after using but has not helped the acne at all.</li>
            <li> Had been using Tri-clense for daily wash. Product was discontinued. Tried two other expensive products and both left me broken out with acne. Went back to Demalogica products and acne is gone without drying!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Dermalogica and I am hooked. This product really works for adult breakouts. I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller then I thought. Not your fault though. I should have read the sizes better. Still a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of products</li>
            <li> Within just a few days my skin was completely clear.  Absolutely worth the cost(but do shop around the internet since you can often find it for $10 less than what the main stores charge).</li>
            <li> seems like nice product but my skin is very oily and apparently needs more medication, as I broke out while using this- I stopped the regimen and went back to my old skin care system. I&#x27;ll keep this stuff for back-up/occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you should also know this is really a small tester kit- it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Did not deliver expected results. Will not try this product in the near future... Test product before using before you waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I used it during the summer because I started to get very bad breakouts that were unusually painful perhaps because of my age and the season. I had acne since I was a teenager and I tried a lot of things and I eventually quit buying acne products because they cost a lot but did nothing for my skin. Then one day I decided to buy the St. Ives exfoliating scrub for acne and sometimes it seems to help and sometimes it seemed to do nothing. I was happy that it at least seemed to help so I kept using it until my unusual breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermalogica is the first product that actually made a significant difference to my skin I used it for about two months. It immediately got rid of the unusual painful bumps that started to invade my skin. There isn&#x27;t that much of the product, but you only need to use pea size. I washed my face with the product at least two times a day. I am not sure the spot concealer worked, but perhaps it did a little bit. I seriously recommend avoiding the eye zone, because the Salicylic acid is more concentrated than most store products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your face is not naturally very oily, I recommend ordering the moisturizing lotion too because they only have a sample packet in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The product seems to cause some acne under my chin and I did not use it on most of my neck. I probably had less the three pimples there, but after using the product, the area under my chin breaks out more. I am not sure if it is entirely because of the product but it seems so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the rest of my face, the product actually inhibits the breakouts or minimizes the bumps very significantly depending on the severity of the acne as influenced by monthly hormonal changes and other factors. During days of big breakouts, the mask helps a lot. I also think that those days I should wash my face three times a day. Since the product seems to attack the acne and prevent it from getting as bad as it could get. I had never had many days of smooth skin, but some days of the month, my skin is nice and smooth. I still don&#x27;t have perfectly clear skin, but my skin seems to be at a balance, where things are not as bad as they can get at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good health habits and sleep are still necessary to minimize the acne and I discovered that when I stopped using products before finding this product. A product can only do so much and a body still needs care for good or better skin to result. When I don&#x27;t sleep much, the product helps a lot to inhibit the intensity of breakouts, but my skin won&#x27;t be as smooth as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product and to give it about a week to start seeing first results. If you have very oily skin, you will need to wash your face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use all the items and I probably will get results if I used the mask every week or two. I would like to try Clinique which seems similar based on the ingredients. Mostly because I want to see if I can get more product with similar ingedients for a similar price. In Clinique doesn&#x27;t work, I will definitely go for Dermalogica because it makes my skin much better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last. These bottles must be for a barbie sized face. Lasted 2 weeks. Spent $50 again. Made it to a month, saw a little difference, but I was still getting new breakouts... A waste of $100....</li>
            <li> I started using this right away and within the first month noticed the difference. Would recommend.  Very small kit didn&#x27;t realize that when.just bought it</li>
            <li> Awesome products! Help with the oil at first, but then my skin gets used to it. But great for weekly use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s amazing and does everything I hoped it would do. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would clear my face up for a long time and I think this will finally do the trick. The only thing I was a little put out about is that it was supposed to be brand new, but everything was opened. A little disappointing that only one of them had the foil seal still attached. The face wash was definitely not full either.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  As of 8/2014, I&#x27;ve been using Dermologica products for about 6 weeks.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product, she says its just OK, it works kind of slow. no results right away. Just FYI.</li>
            <li> Wow. I have tried everything in the store to clear up my skin. I even bought very expensive Vichy, Clarins and Clinique - nothing worked. I am 42 and have breakouts on my T-zone almost every day. My skin was shiny (oily) and every single pore was visible - felt like from space - but this line worked almost from day one. I could immediately see and fee the difference. I would highly recommend it to anyone older who suffers as I did from breakouts and oiliness. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this trial pack to try and am now a believer and will continue to use this as long as I need too and can.&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, and right now I am dealing with more breakouts than I have ever EVER had in my entire life. It&#x27;s become very painful acne all over my chin. Now I know that they say to use the product in it&#x27;s entirety before really making a decision on wether or not it is working for you. I will do just that, I am hopeful that it will begin clearing up and start making my breakouts less. Before using this product I only broke out once a month, never more. I was the fortunate one who never had acne as a teenager. I am now almost 40.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself though, a little does go a long way, and came exactly as advertised, so I don&#x27;t feel as if I got dealt a bad product. I just worry that it may not be meant for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will update after the product is all used up and let you know my final decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/21/2012&lt;br /&gt;  It has been a couple weeks now since I wrote my review. And as I wrote before this product left me with some of the worst acne that I have ever had in my life. I mean literally covering my entire chin area with large acne. Those have since healed, however I have developed new ones, and therefore after all this trouble I feel that this product is not for me. I also have noticed some extra oilyness going on with my skin since starting this product. It was my understanding that this product was supposed to help stop the oily skin issue, this has exacerbated my slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt; I will not knock this product as a whole because this could just be my skin not agreeing with it. I will say that despite the small size of the bottles that the product does in fact last quite a while. A little goes a long way, also they do not leave my skin feeling greasy or as if my skin did not get clean. I hope that this review helps someone that is considering getting this product. I can only hope that their skin responds better to this product than mine did.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is the best I have tried that still is made on the market.  I have adult acne and my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products. Although I do not break out often, I use the overnight clearing gel daily applying it to the problem areas for preventative reasons. The sebum clearing masque is great for when I do have a pimple. I go to bed with a light coat of the masque on the pimple and it is much smaller in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like it so much. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I dont want to blame this product but my acne got SO much worse, i stopped using these types of products all together. I completely cleared my acne with natural products like raw honey and aloe vera. Dont buy this crap, go natural ur skin will thank you</li>
            <li> Yay my skin is clear again and I don&#x27;t need make up!</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have been struggling with my face since my kids were born. I tried everything in the drugstore! Found this product online and thought I would give it a try. LOVED it from day 1. My face was softer and started clearing up after a week of use. Will stay with them forever now.</li>
            <li> I generally have relatively clear skin, but was unhappy with the tiny bumps I had all over. I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and I wanted to have a flawless, smooth finish after applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced purging for the first couple days of using this product. I felt like my skin was so much worse than it had been before. I never had cystic acne before but I had so many of them along with whiteheads all over my face. My skin also became extremely oily during the initial use. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so I kept using it. I noticed that although I had such terrible breakouts, the entire root of the pimples and blackheads came out very, very easy when I picked at them ( I know I shouldn&#x27;t). My skin felt so much smoother after I picked at all the blackheads. About two weeks in, my skin is clear and smooth just as I wanted. I am even comfortable going without makeup. I used everything in this line as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-3) stars: although the package came shrink wrapped to appear as if it was brand new, I was sent used product. I noticed the seal/ sticker at the top of the box was already cut open after removing the shrink wrap. The facial cleanser was only half full and all the tubes had obviously been tampered with prior. I kept it and used it anyways because I did not want to pay for the return shopping. It&#x27;s also such a hassle for me to get to the post office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase this mini set from Ulta or directly from the dermalogica website. It&#x27;s worth a couple extra dollars to ensure that its new and untampered with. I used the products as directed and it has lasted me almost three weeks AND the products I received were used and not even full. Very disappointed with the seller.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit. I bought it because I didnt want to shell out the money for the big cleanser bottle. This kit is awesome for me because I dont really use the other products that often. I dont use the mask and gel (or others listed) very often--maybe once a week, once every two weeks maybe (??). I feel like because I dont use the little bottles very often, its definately a good bang for my buck. I just buy the big bottle of the cleanser because I use that most often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleanser daily, some times twice a day. The clay mask and gel are my favorite (second and third to the cleanser). I bought the cleanser years and years ago and I forgot the name of it. I just remembered that it had that minty/tea tree/eucalyptus type smell to it (which I like). I finally figured it out by doing enough research, and review comment readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cleanser counter to the other ones Dermalogica sells. In my early twenties, I remembered this being a miracle cleanser that hooked up clear skin practically over night. However, as an adult with menstrual acne, I noticed that it didnt work as well as I remembered. I noticed that the first week or so I was breaking out, more than I usually would have...AFTER this first week or so, it cleared up. I dont know if it was just purging gross toxins (I dont wear face [foundations/powders/etc] make up by the way). But I was really pleased with the results after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that if I get lazy and dont wash my face daily (twice a day on the days I work out), I break out instantly. So I actually keep a regimen of washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: after I wash my face with the cleanser, I use an aloe vera , and then a spf 30 antioxidant lotion on my face/neck (aloe/lotion not dermalogica products). I dont really use any other products in the kit so this review is mainly for the cleanser. The other over night gel is cool but I dont think the name \\&quot;over night\\&quot; is a good name. It gives me the feeling that it should clear up your face over night and thats not the case. I guess it just means you wear it over night, but it seems a bit misleading. And the mattifier feels weird. It looks like that weird gel thats in baby diapers once it gets wet. I didnt like the feeling of it on my face so i dont use those products very often. But the clay mask is amazing. I like it because it doesnt dry out your face like those cheap ones you get at the drug store. I use that when I have a problem area. Works like a charm in getting the blemish to go away a lot sooner than it normally would take.</li>
            <li> Many different products to try before you buy.  I haven&#x27;t purchased any full sized products yet but that&#x27;s only because they are too expensive!  I really like the clearing skin wash, clearing mattifier, and the sebum clearing masque. The overnight clearing gel is okay, but the concealing spot treatment didn&#x27;t blend well and it has sulfur in it so it smelled really bad and gave me headaches.  If I had the money I would purchase 4 of the 5 products.</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it IS expensive and I have had a few bumps still pop up.  But it never dried my face out like other well known acne treatments.  It is easy to use and this kit has lasted me over a month with a lot left!  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I developed adult acne very bad on my entire jawline after pregnancy and needed something to clear it up, as it was still lingering even 6 weeks after delivery. I used these products for 2 days and it was almost entirely cleared up already. I will not continue using this once the breakout is completely gone because it&#x27;s probably too harsh for non-acne skin, but I will definitely use this whenever I have a break out. I have cystic acne, which is VERY hard to treat, so I am very pleased that this product line was so successful. Yes, the bottles are small, but you don&#x27;t need to use much at all. And they&#x27;re great travel size!</li>
            <li> I am 28 and have tried all sorts of products to help with my adult acne. I break out from stress frequently and this had changed my skin in just a week! It even started to clear under the skin bumps. The only thing I wish was different, is that it would be nice to have a moisturizer with the purchase. The \\&quot;oil control lotion\\&quot; is a small packet, not a bottle similar to the rest of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kit before and it&#x27;s amazing. Very soothing and gentle on the skin, but definitely clears breakouts and acne.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and was looking for a way to resolve my skin issues.  After having kids my face turned into what I remember as an early teenager.  I just did not get the results I was looking for with this product.  Ensure that you know that these are essentially &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; products, so don&#x27;t expect anything large to come your way.  If you have mild acne problems, this might work, but I would consider my skin worse than mild at the time of trying this and had to turn to other avenues.</li>
            <li> WOW! Fast delivery and product looked as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been struggling with adult acne for a while now and nothing seemed to work.  All of the products I see at the store for acne dried me out like crazy.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and my skin is so much better.  However, it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with hormonal acne. NOTHING has worked. I mean nothing! I&#x27;m even seeing a dermatoligist for the acne. In desperation I bought this because my whole face was broke out. Make-up wasn&#x27;t covering up the deep, red, swollen acne spots. I never had acne in my teens. That night after buying the product I used the night treatment. I woke up the next morning and the once red swollen spots were no longer swollen and red. The spots were still there but not imflamed  and after putting my makeup on you could hardly tell I had acne. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it works. It doesn&#x27;t stop acne from coming but it clears it up faster and allows you to cover up the acne with make-up. Im impressed. Now to work on stopping the acne in the first place :)</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money, the product is small and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> love this product and am hooked!</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had amazing skin, maybe a zit here and there but nothing crazy. Five months before I turned 20 I broke out all over my face. My achne hurt and no matter what I did it wouldn&#x27;t go away, it seriously made me want to never look in the mirror again. I was searching products and this one came up, I had heard of it before so I decided why not. I now feel soooo confident after just a week of only the face wash. I truly love this and believe in it so far!!</li>
            <li> I ordered Ance treatment but they sent me Age Smart....i need a treatment for pimple not for crinkle....the items are not like in the picture too</li>
            <li> It absolutely handled my adult acne problems, which occurred after I stopped taking birth control pills.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I have used a variety of cleansers that have been too harsh or too mild. I discovered this product when i went to a high end salon to get a facial. I have never used a product that agreed so much with my facial skin. It has ingredients that gives your face a cool and tingly sensation. Not an uncomfortable burning sensation like some other products. When you are done with the day, your face is 2 or 3 times less oilier than usual. I don&#x27;t know if it is this product or Dermalogica&#x27;s Anti Bac Wash, but the big pores on my nose have decreased significantly. I have always had big pores on my nose and it is a  surprise for me to see them so small. This product is great for anyone with oily skin. I should note that I&#x27;ve also been using an acne supplement too [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] and have found the combination to be fantastic. So far I&#x27;ve been able to reduce the overall presence of my acne It may be a little expensive for the dermalogica, but it takes forever to get through a whole bottle since you only need less than a dime sized amount to get a good cleaning going.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!! I didnt have a lot a acne or skin issues to begin with (mostly near my cheeks) but it did clear all my blemishes and lighted my skin! It help me get into the role of using a skin routine. Im in my early 20s and ive been told that to maintain a good complexion for years to come--it is important to start at my age. I finish my treatment kit and didnt re-order, because now i use a set of different products that work well for my skin just to maintain it but this set absolutely worked. Never was it harsh on my skin or over drying. The a skin clearing gel was my favorite-- it felt so refleshing!  I have normal to sometimes cominbation skin. Its been a year since i used this but i still recommend it because it works!! I have been complimented on my clear glowing skin and i couldnt be more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting adult onset acne lately and have been searching for a good product that is gentle on my face. It cleans nicely but I still have been breaking out after a month of use. I do like Concealing Spot Treatment a lot. The color matches my lightly tanned Asian skin tone very nicely. The Clearing Mattifier is also really nice and gets absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> The products were small, travel size items. My face felt soft after use and some of the acne went away, however in the last week or so my acne has actually gotten MUCH WORSE. I do not want to blame it solely on the item because I know that diet plays a major part in the affect of acne to the skin and I&#x27;ve had a horrible diet for the past two weeks with not much water (sad, I know). I have do know that some acne products warn that the skin may get worse before it gets better, but I do want to find an acne regimen that will clear my skin of acne, blemishes/acne scars, shrink pores, eliminate oily skin and give me a nice even tone that&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom. Is that too hard to ask for?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin. Very unsatisfied. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Thought it would help with breakouts but seem to get more.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with this product...tried everything else you can think of including face wash from my dermatologist that was $$$$$$.  Nothing seemed to help my hormonal acne until i found this product.  I have been using it for about 2 months now and will never use anything else.  This kit is a bit on small side but a little goes a long way, it lasted almost 2 months. Results are awesome.....have not seen a huge breakout yet :)</li>
            <li> I was having an adult hormonal breakout that resulted in painful pimples.  Every day something was popping up on my chin and my cheeks.  It was so bad and continuous that I could feel the bumps under my skin that hadn&#x27;t surfaced.  I received this product on Saturday, by Monday morning the visible pimples had dried up while the ones under my skin were minimal.  This product definitely worked for my issues.</li>
            <li> This has helped, but I&#x27;m still using concealer for blemishes. It&#x27;s been about three weeks, so I&#x27;ll stick with it and hope my skin continues to improve.  The tone is more even, for sure.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is the only decent product in this set. The rest are tiny, and I mean, barely a week or two worth.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed for 2 months. My acne actually got worst. I seen zero improvement and for the price it was totally not worth it. I&#x27;ve switched to Murad and it seems to be working well at half the price!</li>
            <li> Background: I&#x27;m 30 years old, never had a pimple problem until recently. A promotion at work increased my stress and I&#x27;m sure the extra stress set off my skin. The breakouts started back in Novemeber about 2 weeks after my promotion and nothing from the drug store was working. The pimples I was getting were big, red, deep, painful, and leaving red scars. Very much like the description of cystic acne. I purchased this sample kit before spending the money on the bigger bottles, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now. I&#x27;ll review each individual sample in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin wash: Love it, like another user I noticed a difference within the first few days of washing 2 times a day. Less red, less painful, the pimples were going away without coming to a head, so I wan&#x27;t tempted to pick at or try to pop them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mattifier - I started using this as recommended by the pamphlet included with the kit, which was in the troubled areas (my forehead), I love the way this feels going on, and my skin feels smooth and soft all day long -so I&#x27;m now using on my entire face. I definately see and feel a diference with the oil on the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overnight gel: I use this on my trouble area every night, I can&#x27;t confidently say that I see or feel a difference when I use it. And I&#x27;m a bit torn on if I should actually purchase a bigger bottle when I run out. The texture reminds me a bit of snot (gross I know), but the nice thing is a little bit goes a long way. I guess if I forego purchasing a bigger bottle when I run out, and the breakouts come back -I would purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealing spot treatment: This stuff looks and smells like mud/dirt, it&#x27;s dark, but goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t actually conceal so I can hardly tell it&#x27;s on my face. I&#x27;m pretty pale this time of year so, and since I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on my face I&#x27;ve been using it under my normal concealer. Will I buy more? No, but I will use it while I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theclearing sebum mask: I like this mask, they recommend to use it a few times a week, and again -a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s kinda of like a white clay-ish texture. It&#x27;s &#x27;cooling&#x27; and sometimes the fumes while it&#x27;s drying burn my eyes. I would buy this though, since I feel like it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion: This is probably the biggest disappointment with the kit, it&#x27;s one of the crappy paper-type pouches, and only gives you a few applications worth of the product. It&#x27;s not enough to make a decision on the product. I did notice my skin still felt dry after I used it and I often used other lotions on top of it anyways. I will not be purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The big breakouts are not happening, and the red scars are fading-I&#x27;ve had 3 new pimples in the month I&#x27;ve been using this -they have been smaller and go away much faster. This makes me a believer in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My skin did get dry with the 2 uses a day as recommended. My thought on this was that I&#x27;d rather deal with dry skin than zits. But I have been experimenting, and added in other products which seems to be working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, instead of using the wash on my face, I&#x27;m washing/rinsing only with warm water. I put on the mattifier followed by cetaphil brand spf15 face lotion, and then spot treat with the concealer (that I wont buy more of once its out) and my regular make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening, I use the face wash, the overnight gel on my problem area only, and then instead of lotion I&#x27;m using the Say Yes to Blueberries brand skin repair serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sebum mask only 1-2 times a week when I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be working well for me, and it has reduced the dry skin issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the product, I feel with this kit I&#x27;ve found what works for me, and I hope this review helps other people. Adult acne is awful, even more so when you never had it as a teenager. Your face it the first thing a person sees, and you need to put your best face forward all the time. I feel like this has helped me. And lastly, I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to find something other than drug store products. They were too harsh for my skin and I think created more problems. I know the products here are pricey, and I like keeping my money, but sometimes you just have to realize you are worth it!</li>
            <li> Used for two weeks - was supposed to help with skin congestion, pores, t-zone, etc - made all of these issues worse. Clogged my pores resulting in blackheads everywhere - very drying, made my skin flake and itch. The mattifying product was slick and greasy and never really dried down. Unfortunately when I went online to return item this Seller does not accept returns. A waste of money. Sticking with what I was using- not perfect but so much better than this kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for a week now and can see a difference. I really love dermalogica products, the skin mattifier makes a smooth surface for makeup!</li>
            <li> Read before you purchase because I didn&#x27;t and I would rather make the investment in the full size instead of wasting 40 bucks on an incomplete set. To have good skin health it is recommended to have a moisturizer which is used after the washing of the face and there is only a sample in the set. product is amazing but no I would not purchase this set again</li>
            <li> Horrible, i wish  i could get my money back. if there is a way to get my money back let me know</li>
            <li> 40+ acne sucks&lt;br /&gt;This helped to keep the breakouts away&lt;br /&gt;I only use the face wash once a day my skin was getting really dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a treatment system that worked like this. I&#x27;ve had clear skin for the first time since before pre-teen years and it makes me feel so great that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to wear makeup now :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my situation and maybe even worsened it. Also too many steps to do especially since it&#x27;s not helping.</li>
            <li> Nice kit, still the size of the products is minimal. As some users have said, it appears travel size or less. It might be useful in other cases, but my acne is stronger than the little percentage of Salicylic Acid in this product. Still, my mistake for not realizing it sooner. I gave it a month trial, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference, didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s not enough time to witness a change but I would say it is. Again, maybe it has worked for someone else, not me.</li>
            <li> Some of the items I didn&#x27;t need, but had to get them because you can not mix &amp; match the kit</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find any products to help my skin - ever!  Benzyl Peroxide over dries me and doesn&#x27;t get rid of breakouts for me.  Anything milder OTC doesn&#x27;t help, just keeps things from getting too out of control - just a losing battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this kit!!!!!  Mattifier is fantastic, it keeps the oil level down, no shiny face, and my makeup isn&#x27;t slip-sliding everywhere.  The sulfur spot treatment does the job at stopping outbreaks in their tracks.  (Also use the Zeno hot spot for those spot treatments too, which with this works wonders! Another 5* product)  I use the mask 1x a week, and use an alternate mask I purchased separately about 2-3x a week - a sulfur acne treatment mask. (in a matter of days has gotten rid of redness and excessive oil on my face!)  Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about the wash, but a tiny pea amount at a time washes nicely!  And I use the overnight cleaner all over my face, my face feels very fresh when I go to bed at night!  Came with a sample of the oil control lotion - I think works about the same as the mattifier, try it and decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap - love, love, love!!!  Been using this stuff for a week only!  First time I can say I have beautiful skin!  Finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - This \\&quot;travel kit\\&quot; lasts a little longer than a month if you use the amount recommended.  I am about ready to order another.  I still get breakouts, but they are small and really I am probably the only one who is aware of them. These products keep any breakouts that do happen tiny, and makes them go away quickly.  Less breakouts over all!  Oil is kept in check, redness reduced.  Twice in the past month I had a painful bump emerge under my skin, with this and the Zeno, it shrunk, disappeared, never turned into anything more.  I feel that I look more like an adult, less of a teenager.  And I can decide if I want to wear makeup or not and still feel and look great!  I am not using the face mask in this kit - I am in love with a separate sulfur mask that works better at reducing oil and redness.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my son as we have tried everything on the market-the 1st time we got wonderful results, my son  was pleased as was i.  gave this a 2nd order and unfortunately things did not go as well-so it&#x27;s on to the dr. for an rx</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne I have a breakout every once in a while, but I&#x27;m one of those people that when I have one thing on my face I won&#x27;t stop picking at it and then it gets a million billion times worse. So I decided to try this based on reviews, I really like it and it made my face more clear, they are travel size so they are super small. I think my favorites were the cleanser and the mask. I don&#x27;t think the overnight gel really does anything. BUT the mattifer if you have oily skins work really good. If you put it on before your foundation and powder you WILL NOT get oily for atleast 5 hours. So you don&#x27;t have to do that whole blotting thing. I really like it. Overall good products.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I have used several products for my acne and this one takes the cake.  These products left my face feeling smooth and acne free. My face did not get oily and I woke up with my skin looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> The soap and mask worked well for me.  The other products irritated my skin.  I likely will not try again.</li>
    </ol>
