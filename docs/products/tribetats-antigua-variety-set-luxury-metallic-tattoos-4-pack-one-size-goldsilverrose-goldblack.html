            <li>It adds a very classy and pretty touch to any outfit :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realy happy about it because i think it looks lovely when you put it on your skin, and especially when you pair it with other jewelry!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with TribeTats tattoos, but this is my favorite collection because I love the rose gold feather.</li>
            <li>so much fun for the summer ;)</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and actually stay on nice for quite a few days:)</li>
            <li>I gave some to my 6 year old niece, who also loved them, and they lasted for DAYS on her skin, especially the necklace!</li>

            <li>Once applied they do not fade or come off for a long period of time, but when you are ready for them to be removed you can just use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol for easy removal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You are the center of every party and even if somebody else wears the same tattoo collection it&#x27;s always your own creation.</li>
            <li>My sister and I are definitely planning on buying more in the future!</li>
