            <li>but it gets better</li>

            <li>This does work for about 10 minutes after you spray it, however, it leaves a funny syrupy aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I much prefer just chewing some xylitol gum for fresh breath.</li>

            <li>but I do enjoy having fresh breath when possible.</li>
            <li>Everyone I let use my Binaca wants a bottle for themselves.</li>
            <li>With the exception of one fleeting crunch with the size which inquired extention, Binaca accomplished the reception from the narrow-minded mercenary, me.</li>

            <li> This will definitely kill any bad breath.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help with bad breath, took like 2 weeks for shipping, and tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m one of those people that has ALWAYS got a piece of mint gum or Altoids, or something in there mouth, I don&#x27;t have halitophobia or anything (the fear of bad breath)</li>
            <li> not too bad though, still does well!</li>

            <li> Love this breath spray.  Is long lasting and easy to carry around. My friends are always asking to borrow it.  Hard to find at my local drugstores.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Binaca is one of the best breath fresher out there. I use to use it all the time till stores stop caring them and then I found them here. Everyone I let use my Binaca wants a bottle for themselves. So get one.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  I am very happy.  I will use in the future, too!</li>
            <li> This does work for about 10 minutes after you spray it, however, it leaves a funny syrupy aftertaste. I much prefer just chewing some xylitol gum for fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help with bad breath, took like 2 weeks for shipping, and tastes terrible. I&#x27;m going back to my old brand!</li>
            <li> This breath spray is amazing&lt;br /&gt; It last longer than the ones I&#x27;ve used before&lt;br /&gt;It tastes like fresh mint and it&#x27;s portable for carrying around&lt;br /&gt;But the downside is that it has this after taste that is very very irritating and&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, the spray cap can easily get off&lt;br /&gt;So be mindful of that&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that I will recommend this to anyone looking for great refreshing breath</li>
            <li> Greetings! Obtained graduation and needed Binaca perlustrating my beek stenches even over oblivion. Was used to perfection by yours truly, the mercenary. Successfully, the Peppermint created a fresh coherence to my eupnea. With the exception of one fleeting crunch with the size which inquired extention, Binaca accomplished the reception from the narrow-minded mercenary, me. Deep courtesy toward all!</li>
            <li> I sometimes get bad breath after eating which is really embarrasing when it happens, this is a good size to carry around in a purse (it&#x27;s a bit big for pockets) If you want to keep one around in your pocket I suggest getting the smaller one.</li>
            <li> This product is great! the instructions say \\&quot;2-3\\&quot; sprays in your mouth will keep you fresh, but its more of a \\&quot;5-6\\&quot; sprays. not too bad though, still does well!</li>
            <li> Goodüòçand loved the tasted üòõ&lt;br /&gt;Lasted for about 4 min.&lt;br /&gt;Good after u eat and to üòò kiss that someone</li>
            <li> Item is as described. The blast of spray can wake you up when working overnight hours some co workers remember the name binaca so now they know where to get it from i will purchase again</li>
            <li> Thank you very much! What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Only masks the problem and does not deal with it like Listerine does.  Not impressed.  I have to use this every 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and how clean and fresh it makes my breath feel.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it in the 80s, thanx</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores. It&#x27;s a good product. A little spendy though.</li>
