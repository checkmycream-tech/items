            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful mask that can be used to help with skin and it helps have a glow after</li>
            <li>Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product you have to try it!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Glamglow eye treatment from Sephora and LOVED it!</li>
            <li>so it lasted a good 2 weeks amost!</li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>in the fact I&#x27;m so happy to try it , I would recommend everyone try it</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>The product itself was not that great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>feels amazing afterwards!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s a good product.</li>

            <li>And I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It seemed to be the genuine product!!</li>
            <li>i even used it on my hubby, he liked it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using GlamGlow since BEFORE it hit the market; it is quite honestly the best all-around mask on the market.</li>
            <li>Pores are noticeably tighter, makeup goes on smoother, it has great exfoliation, you can feel it working as it tingles when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend the glamglow eye treatment for brightening. :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite refreshing</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to give advice in that area.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think the one in the white packaging would be best for you!</li>
            <li>This item is authentic but I won&#x27;t buy glamglow again.</li>
            <li>Really love this product</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but worth is!</li>
            <li>Perfect for us dry skin girls.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t pay that much and isn&#x27;t really the best.</li>
            <li>did not go on easy...</li>
            <li>I can see how much it has helped and it makes your skin feel so much better after even one use!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Such a great experience.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This product instantly made my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>If you are deciding on this, just get it, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling refreshed, clean, and tightened.</li>
            <li>Also I believe the clumps in this are dried tea tree leaves which is VERY good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely made my skin softer and feel good</li>
            <li>but there are things on the market that are much cheaper and work better.</li>
            <li>I have been told by some oily skin girls that is doesn&#x27;t do much for them and some love it.</li>
            <li>Fun and fabulous mask</li>
            <li>If you want a nice glow to your skin, add a little baking soda to your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>Leave your face sooo smooth and clear!!!</li>
            <li>As for me..it leaves my skin very soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>It will make your skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>--I love the particles, the smell and the entire muddy experience of this!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t perform any better than my current drugstore product.</li>
            <li>but I needed to leave a review because it was so incredible but definitely buy the larger one because I used the little sexy can in like 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product</li>
            <li>The product boasts to be a &amp;#34;facial in a jar&amp;#34; and really, it was.</li>
            <li>The mask itself works well - curious if it would be even better if I didn&#x27;t have to fiddle with it.</li>
            <li>There are other products that I like better than this one.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin so clean and</li>
            <li>I will defiantly purchase this product again and most likely a larger size too!</li>
            <li>This was worth a try after reading the good reviews, but I was not impressed.</li>
            <li>Not comfortable and too many leaves in it.</li>
            <li>Some days, I would just skip my entire face routine - prime, foundation, concealer, powder, blah blah blah - and just use this because it only takes 10 minutes or less and leaves your skin looking amazing!</li>
            <li>but it came sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product due to the reviews.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought the small one.</li>
            <li>Smells a little wierd but not too strong.</li>
            <li>Product does just what it says and removes black heads leaving the skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>And it does somewhat clear up my skin, but I do not have a lot of acne</li>
            <li>Helps keep my face so clear</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 16 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and refined.</li>
            <li>I tried to ad some water in the hopes that it was just dehydrated, but it just crumbled and was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It will go away after a few minutes and the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling like new!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it really stings my skin the first like minute or two but stick through it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>Tried it, Liked it, but for the price I am not sure considering you can find similar products for half the price.</li>
            <li>Not worth as much as they charge for this stuff, works well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other facial masks, this product seemed to continue to work after it had been washed off-- as the day wore on, my skin felt even fresher and looked much cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Help to dry out any existing spots on my face and clear it up</li>
    </ol>

            <li> sized container only got me through one full treatment, and what little remained dried out</li>
            <li> Its not fabulous enough to pay that high of price for it</li>
            <li> This has little tiny scrubbing balls that you scrub before removing and afterwards your face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that big.</li>
            <li> Apparently the jar wasn&#x27;t closed tight enough?  </li>
            <li> I would invest in some other product next time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to all except people with really dry skin..</li>
            <li> In the winter/fall I have VERYYYY dry skin</li>
            <li> and I used to use a clay mask long ago, but it would majorly dry me out!</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of different products to try to find something to help with tone and dark spots.</li>
            <li> if that is how it was supposed to be) and I was not able to finish the jar because the whole thing dried out.</li>
            <li> Have had equal if not better results with many other LESS expensive products.</li>
            <li> and you can really see my pores on my cheeks and after using this just once I could tell there was a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> It is natural, and does not cost a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I saw some videos on youtube of other people using it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me that any other mud mask I&#x27;ve tried hasn&#x27;t done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I guess it just depends on your other concerns.</li>
            <li> it is so expensive for the large jar.</li>
            <li> Came with little black pieces in it, very dry and had to add water to it to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> but it was not worth the money it cost.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Save your money ladies, this one is not worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little like the other reviews say</li>
            <li> It was thin and rough but it did make my face softer however the amount of blackheads seems the same.</li>
            <li> I used it 2x and it was very dry putting it on (not sure</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a little spendy for a student, so I thought I&#x27;d try the mud mask which is *slightly* cheaper.</li>
            <li> it might be a little to drying for them.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> dot waste ur money</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of adding a little water to it but not sure if it will effect the way the product is suppose to work?</li>
            <li> Have to add water to use it the mud mask because it came all dried out and hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> I really like it  to bad</li>
            <li> so i decided to get a small portion of it myself.</li>
            <li> small Can and quikly finish</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m not pleased - especially considering how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned dollars.</li>
            <li> Came with a chunk of hard mud can&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> and when I opened the jar, the mask was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, the mud was hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> All in all FedEx sucks.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical purchasing it on amazon</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that the price would not match the quality.</li>
            <li> Bad and expensive</li>
            <li> I get dirty a lot</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The tightness of the mask once it dries isn&#x27;t painful at all</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Does not do as it indicates. Have had equal if not better results with many other LESS expensive products. Save your hard earned dollars.</li>
            <li> If you are even thinking about buying this, do it! I love this stuff so much! You need this in your life. Amazing! Kind of pricey, but worth is! It will make your skin baby soft and smooth. Smells a little wierd but not too strong. Great product to have!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a larger bottle! Works wonders! Can tell an obvious difference in my skin after use.</li>
            <li> Did not like this..did not go on easy...</li>
            <li> Definitely made my skin softer and feel good but it was not worth the money it cost. I probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> I will order this again.The price was great.I love the results. I know it works I can feel it working</li>
            <li> in the fact I&#x27;m so happy to try it , I would recommend everyone try it&lt;br /&gt;good lack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regard</li>

            <li> I saw some videos on youtube of other people using it so i decided to get a small portion of it myself. I absolutely LOVED it. I get dirty a lot and i&#x27;m always sweating so getting something that pulled out the dirt from my pores was a must with prom and graduation coming up. I will defiantly purchase this product again and most likely a larger size too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great definitely gives a tingling feeling to your skin when applied!&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels amazing afterwards! Definitely buy again</li>
            <li> picture is definitely bigger than the actual size. It&#x27;s really not that big. wouldn&#x27;t pay that much and isn&#x27;t really the best. I would invest in some other product next time.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Glamglow eye treatment from Sephora and LOVED it! Though it&#x27;s a little spendy for a student, so I thought I&#x27;d try the mud mask which is *slightly* cheaper. I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me that any other mud mask I&#x27;ve tried hasn&#x27;t done.&lt;br /&gt;This sized container only got me through one full treatment, and what little remained dried out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product but I would recommend the glamglow eye treatment for brightening. :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin. It burns a bit.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling like new! The tightness of the mask once it dries isn&#x27;t painful at all it&#x27;s quite refreshing</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of different products to try to find something to help with tone and dark spots. This was worth a try after reading the good reviews, but I was not impressed. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s a good product. I could not tell a big difference. It&#x27;s nice to use but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Came with little black pieces in it, very dry and had to add water to it to apply it to my skin. Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Not worth as much as they charge for this stuff, works well but there are things on the market that are much cheaper and work better.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and easy. The product itself was not that great. It was thin and rough but it did make my face softer however the amount of blackheads seems the same.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful mask that can be used to help with skin and it helps have a glow after</li>
            <li> If you are going to one day ship I warn you the carrier didn&#x27;t even try to deliver the product and when I look at the tracking it says the took it back to the Facility never even coming by my house. All in all FedEx sucks.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was completely dried out. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 16 yr old daughter. She loves it! Product does just what it says and removes black heads leaving the skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> small Can and quikly finish</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! In the winter/fall I have VERYYYY dry skin, I wish I had this product before so I could have worked on my skin during that time. This is a clay mask and I used to use a clay mask long ago, but it would majorly dry me out! This has little tiny scrubbing balls that you scrub before removing and afterwards your face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Perfect for us dry skin girls. And it does somewhat clear up my skin, but I do not have a lot of acne so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to give advice in that area. But whenever I do have acne the day after using this they seem smaller! Love this stuff. I have been told by some oily skin girls that is doesn&#x27;t do much for them and some love it. So I guess it just depends on your other concerns. For those with a lot of acne issues I think the one in the white packaging would be best for you! Also I believe the clumps in this are dried tea tree leaves which is VERY good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Bad and expensive dot waste ur money</li>
            <li> This item is authentic but I won&#x27;t buy glamglow again. Not comfortable and too many leaves in it.</li>
            <li> There are other products that I like better than this one. Glad I bought the small one. I&#x27;ll use this one but I&#x27;ll pick something different next time.</li>
            <li> I had about 2-3 uses of it so it lasted a good 2 weeks amost! And I just love it! Helps keep my face so clear and I have extremely sensitive skin and I recomend to use maybe once or twice a week!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Its not fabulous enough to pay that high of price for it but it does work. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the blackheads on your face, just some of them.</li>
            <li> Made my face feels so good. Help to dry out any existing spots on my face and clear it up</li>
            <li> This product instantly made my skin look amazing! I did not buy it form amazon but I needed to leave a review because it was so incredible but definitely buy the larger one because I used the little sexy can in like 2 weeks. Some days, I would just skip my entire face routine - prime, foundation, concealer, powder, blah blah blah - and just use this because it only takes 10 minutes or less and leaves your skin looking amazing! Wonderful product you have to try it! My only complaint is that it really stings my skin the first like minute or two but stick through it! It will go away after a few minutes and the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I got this as a trial since I have heard raving review on this product.  I am definitely buying the orig version! It does sting a little like the other reviews say but after a while it goes away.  I have sensitive skin and this did not cause an allergic reaction.  Leave your face sooo smooth and clear!!! If you are deciding on this, just get it, it is worth it! This is enough to decide if you will like it or not.</li>
            <li> glamglow realliy does what it says .  it definetly gives your skin a youthful look  I really like it  to bad it is so expensive for the large jar.</li>
            <li> Fun and fabulous mask--I love the particles, the smell and the entire muddy experience of this!  Makes your skin soft and refined.</li>
            <li> Tried it, Liked it, but for the price I am not sure considering you can find similar products for half the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I can see how much it has helped and it makes your skin feel so much better after even one use!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed. I received this product and had to throw it out almost immediately. It arrived in packaging that looked torn and when I opened the jar, the mask was hard as a rock. I tried to ad some water in the hopes that it was just dehydrated, but it just crumbled and was completely unusable. I can only guess that the product was expired or that the damaged packaging had something to do with it. Either way, I&#x27;m not pleased - especially considering how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> Save your money ladies, this one is not worth all the hype. It didn&#x27;t perform any better than my current drugstore product. If you want a nice glow to your skin, add a little baking soda to your favorite cleanser. It is natural, and does not cost a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GlamGlow since BEFORE it hit the market; it is quite honestly the best all-around mask on the market. Pores are noticeably tighter, makeup goes on smoother, it has great exfoliation, you can feel it working as it tingles when you first put it on. I bought these mini&#x27;s as stocking stuffers and now everyone is hooked!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that the price would not match the quality. The product boasts to be a &amp;#34;facial in a jar&amp;#34; and really, it was. This product left my skin so clean and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other facial masks, this product seemed to continue to work after it had been washed off-- as the day wore on, my skin felt even fresher and looked much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the larger size. Such a great experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I was a little skeptical purchasing it on amazon but it came sealed and brand new. It seemed to be the genuine product!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, the mud was hard as a rock.  Apparently the jar wasn&#x27;t closed tight enough?  I&#x27;ve managed to add some water and reconstitute it to a spreading consistency.  The mask itself works well - curious if it would be even better if I didn&#x27;t have to fiddle with it.</li>
            <li> Have to add water to use it the mud mask because it came all dried out and hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Really love this product (I got the tiny 15gram jar) it leaves your skin feeling refreshed, clean, and tightened. I have sensitive skin and you can really see my pores on my cheeks and after using this just once I could tell there was a dramatic improvement. Will definitely use/purchase again.</li>
