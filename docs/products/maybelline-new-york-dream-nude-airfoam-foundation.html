            <li>I hope Maybelline continues to make this foundation because it is perfect for my skin and is a very reasonable price on Amazon.</li>

            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, airy, and makes my skin look soft and flawless.</li>
            <li>I really love this makeup.</li>
            <li>This stuff surely gives it a run for its money, and it&#x27;s way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have A Combination skin tone most of the year however during Winter</li>
            <li>The price is good though and it did ship fast.</li>
            <li>I use a makeup primer immediately before which makes the product easy to spread and blend on my face.</li>
            <li>, I had this bottle that was as good as new</li>
            <li>So light, like wearing nothing.</li>
            <li>It is light and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Makes her skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>I think I went for like a year almost without wearing foundation which is very rare of me since I have blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>i have extremely fair irish skin</li>
            <li>It feels really cool to put in your face</li>
            <li>love it fast shipping</li>
            <li>However this company makes things right with their customers, they want customer satisfaction</li>
            <li>first time using this</li>
            <li>I had no problem with the colour, it was matching my skin tone  pretty close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light,  soft,  but colour isn&#x27;t  ivory, it looks like beige.</li>
            <li>They Classic Ivory is not at all the right color</li>
            <li>but since I was dealing with my dry, flaky skin I thought a liquid foundation would be a better choice.</li>
            <li>Even though my face was extremely dry people would tell me it looked better without the foundation than it did when I had</li>
            <li>It feels nice when you put it on, very light, but once it actually dries it feels thick on your face.  </li>
            <li>It come&#x27;s out to much.</li>
            <li>It covers really well, and</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>People thought I had a severe acne breakout, and I was covering it with foundation cause it looked very caky.</li>
            <li>, I applied it like I normally would this isn&#x27;t the first time I purchased a liquid foundation I had one before</li>
            <li>I guess it would have but this one in particular just did not sit well with me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is very soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to pump it.</li>
            <li>but dont forget to shaike it before use , when you applay it on your skeen its so soft as if you didnt put any make up</li>
            <li>I never break out with this product, and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking natural.</li>
            <li>Because I like my foundation to be a bit more thick in consistency.  </li>
            <li>only wore this a maximum of 3-4 times, and in each and everyone of them it would end up doing the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>Crappy product in general</li>
            <li>Not heavy feeling and lasts my long 10 hr shifts at work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this foundation. So light, like wearing nothing. Blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> It was dryed up and I want my money back</li>
            <li> but dont forget to shaike it before use , when you applay it on your skeen its so soft as if you didnt put any make up</li>
            <li> Color is perfect - it matches my skin tone exactly and doesn&#x27;t leave any makeup lines. I use a makeup primer immediately before which makes the product easy to spread and blend on my face. Without the primer, it is a bit tricky to blend before it sets and gets splotchy. It does last all day long. It is a medium coverage, a little less than I prefer for foundation, but with a setting powder it is OK for everyday. I use the matte mousse for going out since it is heavier coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. It&#x27;s light, airy, and makes my skin look soft and flawless. It lasts all day even in the hot Arizona summer and works beautifully over my moisturizer. I never break out with this product, and I have really sensitive skin. I hope Maybelline continues to make this foundation because it is perfect for my skin and is a very reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does not feel, smell, or look at all like foundation. It is very dark, and also applies in an odd way.(hard to explain) I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just like the feel of it...I mix it with my 30 spf daily moisturizer so it&#x27;s like having a tinted moisturizer...goes on smoothly and for the price, good deal!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It come&#x27;s out to much. They Classic Ivory is not at all the right color I thought it&#x27;s a LOT darker then I thought. I am not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> hate it.  i have extremely fair irish skin and i got the fairest shade, so theres no reason this product should have been bright orange.  I advise all not to get it.  It feels nice when you put it on, very light, but once it actually dries it feels thick on your face.  Not a good product regardless of its  orange color.</li>
            <li> Not for open pores but it is very soft!</li>
            <li> Great foundation and very good coverage but it&#x27;s almost impossible not to make a mess when applying it. Even after washing my hands several times, I have this feeling that they are are dirty/dried because of the foam.</li>
            <li> I really love this makeup. A little bit goes a long ways. It covers really well, and it once it dries, it feels like I have nothing on, but I still have the look of an even complexion. I&#x27;ve never tried BareMinerals, but I&#x27;ve heard it works so great, one looks naturally beautiful. This stuff surely gives it a run for its money, and it&#x27;s way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Came dented and black stuff on it. However this company makes things right with their customers, they want customer satisfaction and I&#x27;m very satisfied. Goes on smooth does feel a lil bit oily on face, but making skin flawlessly beautiful. Will order from them again</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It was expired when I received it. They gave me a refund so I went and bought some.  It is light and lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like I have makeup caked on.  This is like a mousse, so it&#x27;s very light in weight.  Awesome foundation.</li>
            <li> Waterproof!  lasted a good 6 hours at the waterpark and it is great for being outdoors</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. It&#x27;s like a foam that just disappears when you put it on your face.</li>
            <li> Not for you if you like a thicker foundation. This is just like hair mouse. I&#x27;m not a fan. Because I like my foundation to be a bit more thick in consistency.  The price is good though and it did ship fast. But I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> Maybe its great foundation.Who Knows.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Redbasket shop and  product was expired so I cant tell you how it was.</li>
            <li> It hardly cover anything, I hate how hard it was to get the foundation out and the application was difficult.</li>
            <li> A little tricky at first with the pump because a little shot goes a long way. Not heavy feeling and lasts my long 10 hr shifts at work.</li>
            <li> It feels really cool to put in your face it&#x27;s so light it feels like you have nothing on. The only thing I don&#x27;t necessarily like is the pump thing on it. It&#x27;s kind of hard to pump it.</li>
            <li> first time using this and i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face looking so creamy. I get conpliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I do not like the foam at all it does not have good coverage.. Maybelline is good make up most of the time.. but this was a fail for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this foundation for years now and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Colorado so I had to order online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Mousse version and it irritated my eyes. So glad I found this on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for my fair skin tone. Gives me a little color without looking unnatural. Super easy to apply and goes on smooth. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this foundation. Leaves my skin looking natural. I will continue to use this foundation as long as there is supply.</li>
            <li> Before I start, here&#x27;s a little background about my skin that might help potential buyers out there. I have A Combination skin tone most of the year however during Winter my skin gets extremely dry due to the weather. Which incidentally was about the time I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I have no problem with A Powder foundation in fact I prefer it over liquids for the fact it feels lighter in comparison but since I was dealing with my dry, flaky skin I thought a liquid foundation would be a better choice. I guess it would have but this one in particular just did not sit well with me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the purpose of a liquid foundation was to make your skin look less flaky and dry, but this foundation seemed to do none of that. In fact it made my skin worse! People thought I had a severe acne breakout, and I was covering it with foundation cause it looked very caky. It emphasised on the dryness around my eyes, over the course of the day it was flaking off even... I had no problem with the colour, it was matching my skin tone  pretty close, I applied it like I normally would this isn&#x27;t the first time I purchased a liquid foundation I had one before and it did NOT do this to my face, also it felt like I had a clay mask on my face and like my skin could not breath at all when I had this on I could not wait to just go back home and wash it off immediately! Even though my face was extremely dry people would tell me it looked better without the foundation than it did when I had the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wore this a maximum of 3-4 times, and in each and everyone of them it would end up doing the same exact thing. I even tried it when Winter was over and my skin&#x27;s dryness improved but it still dried it out! I think I went for like a year almost without wearing foundation which is very rare of me since I have blemishes on my skin and my pores are visible, I had this bottle that was as good as new just laying around on my shelve but I could not wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of raving reviews, if this foundation worked for people then great for them but personally it just did not work for me and I have a great tolerance for drug store foundation and cosmetics.ng reviews, if this foundation worked for people then great for them but personally it just did not work for me and I have a great tolerance for drug store foundation and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light,  soft,  but colour isn&#x27;t  ivory, it looks like beige.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Crappy product in general</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. Makes her skin really smooth.</li>
