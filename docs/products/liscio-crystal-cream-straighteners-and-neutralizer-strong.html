            <li>Liscio products are the BEST</li>
            <li>It came out great!</li>
            <li>Excellent product makes the job !</li>
            <li>I have used Liscio TR product before with great results, but not from this seller!</li>
            <li>This is for experienced DIY&#x27;ers and professionals, and it is best to do a patch test first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with result, thank you</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and works great.</li>
            <li>i did it on my own since i have 2 years of makeup &amp; hairstylist experience</li>
            <li>My advice is not to use the strong formula on a highlighted hair !</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But if softener touches scalp it is ok and will NOT cause</li>
            <li>Note that it&#x27;s ok if the neutralizer touches the scalp &amp; roots, as it will NOT cause</li>
            <li>sooo saved me $100 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My hair grew out though, and since it was time to get it touched up, I panicked until i was able to remember the product my stylist told me she used.</li>
            <li>It looks more textured than before, and I can&#x27;t even get a comb through it now.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>is working very well!!!</li>
            <li>The Brow Art delivered the Liscio items quickly, which were brand new and packaged nicely to survive shipping.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your hair looks silky straight from root to ends.  </li>
            <li>My 3c hair is now silky, wavy, frizz free and growing fast.  </li>
            <li>It was straight, but with a little more texture and body (which I like even better than the pin straight one I got originally!).</li>
            <li>I have VERY course and thick curly hair and this product gets it looking amazing!</li>
            <li>Made my hair straight and shiny....</li>
            <li>I applied the neutralizer from roots to ends to lock in the silky straight look.</li>
            <li>Gently work it through your hair, ensuring even coverage.  </li>
            <li>Then I gently rinsed for about 10 minutes (again insufficient rinsing can lead to breakage).  </li>
            <li>saved money from going to the salon YAY straight hair.</li>
            <li>I got a Japanese Straightening done professionally at a salon for over 500 dollars and though it did turn out amazing, I was not willing to EVER spend that much money on my hair again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s straight but not for long.</li>
            <li>i just purchased this product can some one please list a simple step by step to use this product cuz i have seen so many different ways to apply i did not purchase any of the other products that have been seeing ppl apply loke the protection cream and root cream or whatever cna i just use regular shampoo and conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;plz</li>
            <li>Applied straightener to new growth only (again, not too close to roots or scalp, which can cause breakage.  </li>
            <li>The only caveat is if you are new to this process, find youtube videos, the Instructables.com instructions AND read the Milbon newsletters before attempting this.</li>
            <li>I did not let it get wet for 48 hours, as the hair needs time to oxidize and lock in the pattern of silky straight or silky wavy</li>
            <li>ironed my hair in small sections, giving most of the attention to the roots, passing a 410 degree iron over the roots about 4x times, and the previously processed hair 1-2x.</li>
            <li>I got very thick and strong hair</li>
            <li>This item absolutely FRIED my slightly curly/frizzy hair.</li>

            <li> If you want a little wave, you can use a waving or curling iron after the flat iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dried, flat ironed and curled again.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I dried hair about 90% dry.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Then I dried it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair is not straightener and dried than before.</li>
            <li> Less the one star!!!</li>

            <li> Worst product, not good smell and the result is not good all!!! Less the one star!!!</li>
            <li> Works as promised. Easy to apply</li>
            <li> is working very well!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect product and transaction.</li>
            <li> Made my hair straight and shiny....Love this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Don&#x27;t waste your money. They wouldn&#x27;t even let me return it. My hair looks so frizzy and coarse now.</li>
            <li> The Brow Art delivered the Liscio items quickly, which were brand new and packaged nicely to survive shipping.  Liscio products are the BEST but you have to know what you are doing before using them.  This is for experienced DIY&#x27;ers and professionals, and it is best to do a patch test first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those DIY&#x27;ers that are curious about how I used them, here&#x27;s what I did-&lt;br /&gt;1. I shampooed &amp; conditioned my hair with PPT Do from Milbon (Milbon owns Liscio and designs products that are compatible to use with hair that has been  straightened via the Japanes thermal straightening process.&lt;br /&gt;2. I dried hair about 90% dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. I generously applied the Liscio root softener to my roots (do NOT skip this step as the straightener should NOT be applied to roots or you risk breakage or the dreaded &#x27;bends&#x27;. But if softener touches scalp it is ok and will NOT cause breakage).&lt;br /&gt;4. Applied the Hair Protection Cream to previously processed hair (it protects previously processd hair by slowing down action of straightener by 30, 50 or 90%).&lt;br /&gt;5. Applied straightener to new growth only (again, not too close to roots or scalp, which can cause breakage.  Again, generously applying the root softener will prevent breakage) and processed for allotted time (go to the Milbon site and look at their newsletters for advice on how to tell if hair has been processed sufficiently).&lt;br /&gt;6. I thoroughly rinsed hair for about 10 minutes (insufficient rinsing can lead to breakage). Note that I did NOT shampoo.  Then I dried it again.&lt;br /&gt;7. Next I used a Liscio heat protectant then flat ironed my hair in small sections, giving most of the attention to the roots, passing a 410 degree iron over the roots about 4x times, and the previously processed hair 1-2x. Make sure your hair looks silky straight from root to ends.  If you want a little wave, you can use a waving or curling iron after the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;8. I applied the neutralizer from roots to ends to lock in the silky straight look. Gently work it through your hair, ensuring even coverage.  Note that it&#x27;s ok if the neutralizer touches the scalp &amp; roots, as it will NOT cause breakage.&lt;br /&gt;9.  I left in neutralizer for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;10. Then I gently rinsed for about 10 minutes (again insufficient rinsing can lead to breakage).  I did NOT shampoo, I just conditioned with PPT Do.&lt;br /&gt;11.  I used a Liscio heat protectant then blow dried, flat ironed and curled again.  I did not let it get wet for 48 hours, as the hair needs time to oxidize and lock in the pattern of silky straight or silky wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I have used this process several times and have NOT had any breakage. My 3c hair is now silky, wavy, frizz free and growing fast.  The only caveat is if you are new to this process, find youtube videos, the Instructables.com instructions AND read the Milbon newsletters before attempting this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work permanently. When my hair air dries is still turns wavy. When im out of the shower and wet it&#x27;s straight but not for long. I got the same results using a $30 hair relaxer from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> worked for me, but keep in mind you will have breakage, its chemical after all!</li>
            <li> saved money from going to the salon YAY straight hair. instead of $200 paying to have a stylist do it half ass i did it on my own since i have 2 years of makeup &amp; hairstylist experience sooo saved me $100 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have VERY course and thick curly hair and this product gets it looking amazing! I got a Japanese Straightening done professionally at a salon for over 500 dollars and though it did turn out amazing, I was not willing to EVER spend that much money on my hair again. My hair grew out though, and since it was time to get it touched up, I panicked until i was able to remember the product my stylist told me she used. I bit the bullet and got my DIY savvy friend to do it for me... It came out great! It was straight, but with a little more texture and body (which I like even better than the pin straight one I got originally!). I will be buying this product often!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and works great. I got very thick and strong hair so I used the red bag for 30 min, used flat iron for about an hour, and the white bag for half an hour. I could definitely see the difference!</li>
            <li> Excellent product makes the job ! My advice is not to use the strong formula on a highlighted hair !</li>
            <li> I really do not recommend these products. After using it, my hair is not straightener and dried than before. I tried to return it, but they answered do not receive unsealed bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with result, thank you</li>
            <li> i just purchased this product can some one please list a simple step by step to use this product cuz i have seen so many different ways to apply i did not purchase any of the other products that have been seeing ppl apply loke the protection cream and root cream or whatever cna i just use regular shampoo and conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;plz help!!</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL! This item absolutely FRIED my slightly curly/frizzy hair. It looks more textured than before, and I can&#x27;t even get a comb through it now. I have used Liscio TR product before with great results, but not from this seller!</li>
