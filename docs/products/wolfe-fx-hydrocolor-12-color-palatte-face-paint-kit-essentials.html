            <li>MY DAYS WITH CHEAP OIL-BASED HALLOWEEN PAINT ARE OVER!!!</li>
            <li>My friends loved them</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift for Christmas and loved it.</li>
            <li>The kids loved it.</li>
            <li>The parents loved it.</li>
            <li>The color trueness and fast set time, is the best I&#x27;ve seen from any product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for providing a beautiful easy to use product, so a newbie like me was able to do sugar skull makeup with ease.</li>
            <li>Wolfe Bros. face paint is easy to use and a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Good if you want it to easily washed off.  </li>
            <li>The paint lasted all night and it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>These are, by far, the best face paints we have ever used.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and the paint goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and the texture is clean and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>So I forked up forty bucks for this face painting kit because Wolfe is one of the more reowned names in face painting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Wolfe brand. :)</li>
            <li>The colors were noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just love working with this product</li>
            <li>I had to scrub it off w/ a scouring pad- which I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to resort to if I had painted on my face.</li>
            <li>While these contain a bit of wax for longer lasting paints, coming into contact with water while wearing them isn&#x27;t the best idea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the greasy paint sold at most stores during Holloween.</li>
            <li>In all fairness though I haven&#x27;t been at it long and may not be the best judge of face</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get this new set for an upcoming face painting event -</li>
            <li>This paint is really nice and quick drying.</li>
            <li>While I am sure the idea was that they could be replaced easily if one ran out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews the product reflected the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>We made a lot of kids happy so far.</li>
            <li>It gives great results and looks like professional face painting&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no comparison, Wolfe paints are so easy to use, go on very smoothly and clean off skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Being water soluble, it comes off as easy as it goes on.  </li>
            <li>Smears easily with even damp napkin.  </li>
            <li>Just keep your brush wet, and the paint goes on smooth and perfect.  </li>
            <li>colors do not remove easily from face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you want superior high quality paints like the pros use, buy these.</li>
            <li>This paint is very vibrant and provides amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>I have tried using the cheap stuff from craft stores.</li>
            <li>so kids are comfortable with it</li>
            <li>I had so much fun being creative with this product without having to worry if the colors would run or crack.</li>
            <li>I may not be experienced enough to work with this texture.</li>
            <li>I used baby wipes to clean up any mess and they worked perfectly for removing the paint that didn&#x27;t wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove cleanly without too much scrubbing so its easy to fix mistakes on kids or just remove altogether!</li>
            <li>They were easy to use, easy to clean up and were pretty smear resistant.  </li>
            <li>This brand is amazing, I&#x27;m new at face painting &amp; this product makes me want to face paint as a side job.</li>
            <li>I think this kit is more suited to a more professional face painter who caters to adults.  </li>
            <li>love this, it draws smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I did a practice run on my own hand and wasn&#x27;t able to wash it off completely- especially the darker colors.</li>
            <li>There are a nice assortment of vivid colors.</li>
            <li>They went on nicely, the colors are bright, and the paint dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>Despite much effort with soap and water the stain stayed for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used them at my kids&#x27; school carnival and was really happy with them, as were the other volunteer face painters.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the best face paint I have used to date.</li>
            <li>I tested it out on my leg and left it over night, &amp; it stayed on the next morning perfect</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smear easily because they dry very fast, which can be a good</li>
            <li>My kids love them, and I appreciate the high quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and blend very well, plus they dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I was able to complete more faces in the same amount of time and with better results.</li>
            <li>The paint is easy to use and paints on very well.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not a professional, I face paint for parties and events at my parents&#x27; local yacht club and this is the best paint I&#x27;ve used out of the three brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>these apply like water colors, so much easier to get fine details.  </li>
            <li>Still using these after a few months, great for practice, sugar skulls, pop art, etc</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>washed right off with water, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with sweating it</li>
            <li>The quality of this face paint is pretty good, Although it&#x27;s a little hard to remove them after passing some time, but still I love this kit, easy and fun to use, there are enough colors, also the brushes that come with it are good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Use this for a whole haunt season of special effect makeup for our actors out working the lines.</li>
            <li>The black is exceptional in it&#x27;s ability to go on and be a bold color.</li>
            <li>This kit will probably last me two or more Halloween seasons, so it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I also bought a large pot of white by itself for the purpose of what I wanted to do, but I descovered that I might have been able to do it all with this kit alone.</li>
            <li>Really great starter set for somebody serious about face painting and a beginner/intermediate.</li>
            <li>My only issues are they come off too easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy this product again once we use it all up.  </li>
            <li>This paint goes on smooth, blends well with the right sponges and last all night long and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping...</li>
            <li>they are very smear resistant.  </li>
            <li>I really like the intensity of the colors and the ease of application and removal.  </li>
            <li>I had been trying to use the cheap face paint from wal mart mixed in with my make up....</li>
            <li>Did two full face and neck make ups and it looks like I barely used them at all.</li>
            <li>said, and I like the fact that the colors are replaceable--I&#x27;m always running out of red and white, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy single colors instead of an entirely new palette!</li>
            <li>Great for professional looking work done by a amateur!</li>
            <li>Now if it&#x27;s just a bit of sweat or rain drizzle they will hold up better than any other well known paint brands.</li>
            <li>I am excited for next Halloween!</li>
            <li>The pigments are very opaque and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Goes on even, stays wet without drying out too fast during application and dries smooth.</li>
            <li>The cons; in this particular kit the colors are removeable.</li>
            <li>still like this kit because of how vibrant the colors are but would like to say buyer beware.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the colors are as vibrant as they appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vibrant if I were to use one word.</li>
            <li>I have used some Wolfe Brothers paints before and bought this palette when the older one ran out.</li>
            <li>These are the first professional paints I&#x27;ve used - and wow what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Wolfe products are bright, smear resistant, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it be gone in a few hours or so anyway.  </li>
            <li>oh well I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>and I admit I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>They are chalky when dry- more like powdered make-up- or dry tempera paint .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and not too messy for a beginner.  </li>
            <li>it came off rather quickly when they get wet.</li>
            <li>But I like using it for young children with concern parents.</li>
            <li>had a lot of fun painting a bunch of 2nd and 3rd graders</li>
            <li>This is not like the cheap paints you get at walmart and goes a long long way!</li>
            <li>Other water based paints are easier to use, many don&#x27;t last as long or blend as well either.</li>
            <li>Not a bad little kit to start one&#x27;s makeup collection.</li>
            <li>These paints are high quality, and have definitely served their purpose for face paint.  </li>
            <li>In other words, a little goes a long way, and the quality is so good you can wear it all day without having to worry about the paint fading, or getting oily, or getting dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Most of the videos on Youtube even when using other brands tend to use Wolfe white or black face paint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to painting as one reviewer mentioned then of course you have to practice using them, all paints are different and Wolfe paint are different from others on the market.</li>
            <li>and you have to be very careful with how much water you use or the color will run a lot.</li>
            <li>If you have a little water, make up sponges, and a couple paint brushes you are ready to go!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find them difficult to use, my favorite thing about them is they are so much easier to blend colors than other paints.</li>
            <li>With a little no sweat it stays in place for a few hours and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>this can be a good and bad thing I guess, depending on how you plan to use it.</li>

            <li> Goes on even, stays wet without drying out too fast during application and dries smooth.</li>
            <li> The cons; in this particular kit the colors are removeable.</li>
            <li> still like this kit because of how vibrant the colors are but would like to say buyer beware.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the colors are as vibrant as they appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vibrant if I were to use one word.</li>
            <li> I have used some Wolfe Brothers paints before and bought this palette when the older one ran out.</li>
            <li> These are the first professional paints I&#x27;ve used - and wow what a difference!  </li>
            <li> Wolfe products are bright, smear resistant, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it be gone in a few hours or so anyway.  </li>
            <li> oh well I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> and I admit I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> They are chalky when dry- more like powdered make-up- or dry tempera paint .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and not too messy for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> it came off rather quickly when they get wet.</li>
            <li> But I like using it for young children with concern parents.</li>
            <li> had a lot of fun painting a bunch of 2nd and 3rd graders</li>
            <li> This is not like the cheap paints you get at walmart and goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> Other water based paints are easier to use, many don&#x27;t last as long or blend as well either.</li>
            <li> Not a bad little kit to start one&#x27;s makeup collection.</li>
            <li> These paints are high quality, and have definitely served their purpose for face paint.  </li>
            <li> In other words, a little goes a long way, and the quality is so good you can wear it all day without having to worry about the paint fading, or getting oily, or getting dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Most of the videos on Youtube even when using other brands tend to use Wolfe white or black face paint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to painting as one reviewer mentioned then of course you have to practice using them, all paints are different and Wolfe paint are different from others on the market.</li>
            <li> and you have to be very careful with how much water you use or the color will run a lot.</li>
            <li> If you have a little water, make up sponges, and a couple paint brushes you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find them difficult to use, my favorite thing about them is they are so much easier to blend colors than other paints.</li>
            <li> With a little no sweat it stays in place for a few hours and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> this can be a good and bad thing I guess, depending on how you plan to use it.</li>
            <li> I would at least recommend that if you are a amatuer or new professional like me to buy them well in advance and practice a lot prior to using them on the job.</li>
            <li> pros; the colors are vibrant and once dried</li>
            <li> They last for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> The paint lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I like the fact they are dry and activated by a wet paintbrush, so they should last for years to come.</li>
            <li> but it can be a problem with dry glitter.</li>
            <li> Not normally accustomed to using face paint.  </li>
            <li> She washed it off minutes later and the black had stained her face.  </li>
            <li> This is in comparison to all face paint products from your typical hobby store, or big name brand store including Snazaroo.</li>
            <li> Rinses off with water, minimal rubbing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a tad expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The palettes are a little smaller than I thought at the time of purchase but a little paint from this kit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a while to figure out how to use the paints because even when using very little water they got really wet and once applied took a very long time to dry (like minutes)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying other brands, trust me</li>
            <li> little goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried fab, tab or other name brand face paints but did consider them</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> The other brands are oilier/ waxier- which smear easier</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;I painted everyone&#x27;s face in my group, including mine, before heading to a &#x27;Day of the Dead&#x27; celebration,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The dark colors did take a bit of scrubbing though if you wanted to immediately get rid of all traces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I painted a spiderman mask on my daughter which requires black.  </li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> This got my hands messy.  </li>
            <li> I made up my face as a sort of dead bride with a Dias de Los Muertos type theme for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> and the staining isn&#x27;t permenant and was gone in a few</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used greasy type face paints...</li>
            <li> That is not to say that these paints are not good, as a matter of fact of all the face paints I&#x27;ve used I like these a lot, pules they are not super pricey.</li>
            <li> Not good if you want for long-lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> but frankly I don&#x27;t think I should use them on the kid&#x27;s faces because I know  the parents are going to have a very hard time getting it off of their skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an essential palette for those who like to keep their face painting kits compact.  The colors are beautiful and blend very well, plus they dry quickly. Love these.</li>
            <li> The palettes are a little smaller than I thought at the time of purchase but a little paint from this kit goes a long way.  Not a bad little kit to start one&#x27;s makeup collection.</li>
            <li> The paint is of great quality and I could not have been happier with my investment. The paint is easy to use and paints on very well. We made a lot of kids happy so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price. I have tried using the cheap stuff from craft stores. There is no comparison, Wolfe paints are so easy to use, go on very smoothly and clean off skin thoroughly. The paint lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Not normally accustomed to using face paint.  However,  I found that the make up stayed on all day without smearing. I&#x27;ve heard good reviews the product reflected the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> The quality of this face paint is pretty good, Although it&#x27;s a little hard to remove them after passing some time, but still I love this kit, easy and fun to use, there are enough colors, also the brushes that come with it are good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughters 8th birthday party.  They were easy to use, easy to clean up and were pretty smear resistant.  I would recommend these to any of my friends.  I&#x27;ll certainly buy this product again once we use it all up.  This will be great around Halloween time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying other brands, trust me I did already. I ended up with Wolfe and will never go back. Goes on even, stays wet without drying out too fast during application and dries smooth. Washes off with no problem.</li>
            <li> This paint is really nice and quick drying. It does stain skin but oh well I&#x27;ll live. I&#x27;m sure it be gone in a few hours or so anyway.  Lightning fast shipping... Thank God bc I need to practice a bit before Halloween hits.</li>
            <li> Wolfe Bros. face paint is easy to use and a good value for the money.  Being water soluble, it comes off as easy as it goes on.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> It gives great results and looks like professional face painting&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy so kids are comfortable with it&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of fun painting a bunch of 2nd and 3rd graders - they looked great and felt great too</li>
            <li> One word - WASHABLE!  Rinses off with water, minimal rubbing.  Good if you want it to easily washed off.  Not good if you want for long-lasting effect.  Smears easily with even damp napkin.  But I like using it for young children with concern parents.</li>
            <li> So I forked up forty bucks for this face painting kit because Wolfe is one of the more reowned names in face painting.  Most of the videos on Youtube even when using other brands tend to use Wolfe white or black face paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros; the colors are vibrant and once dried they are very smear resistant.  They last for a really long time.  The cons; in this particular kit the colors are removeable. While I am sure the idea was that they could be replaced easily if one ran out it becomes a nuisance while trying to paint.  They kept popping out of place leaving me to take the color out and hold it in my hand while painting.  This got my hands messy.  Also each individual color also has a plastic cover on it. I would recommend taking all of these off before you begin because trying to do it while painting was a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to figure out how to use the paints because even when using very little water they got really wet and once applied took a very long time to dry (like minutes) Which when painting a line of kids can feel like hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted a spiderman mask on my daughter which requires black.  She washed it off minutes later and the black had stained her face.  I assumed that she did not wash it properly so I tried.  Despite much effort with soap and water the stain stayed for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this kit because of how vibrant the colors are but would like to say buyer beware.  I think this kit is more suited to a more professional face painter who caters to adults.  I would at least recommend that if you are a amatuer or new professional like me to buy them well in advance and practice a lot prior to using them on the job.</li>
            <li> I really like the intensity of the colors and the ease of application and removal.  In the past I&#x27;ve used greasy type face paints...these apply like water colors, so much easier to get fine details.  My only issues are they come off too easily.  I had painted skull teeth around my mouth, but when taking a sip of water I smeared the paint.  Next year, I&#x27;ll use these everywhere except around my mouth.  I like the fact they are dry and activated by a wet paintbrush, so they should last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My friends loved them</li>
            <li> These are the first professional paints I&#x27;ve used - and wow what a difference!  I used them at my kids&#x27; school carnival and was really happy with them, as were the other volunteer face painters.  They went on nicely, the colors are bright, and the paint dried quickly.  No smudging either!  We didn&#x27;t have any problem washing it off with soap and water.  The dark colors did take a bit of scrubbing though if you wanted to immediately get rid of all traces.</li>
            <li> This works great. I got it as a gift for Christmas and loved it. The colors are great and the texture is clean and easy to work with. It is easy to remove cleanly without too much scrubbing so its easy to fix mistakes on kids or just remove altogether!</li>
            <li> Use this for a whole haunt season of special effect makeup for our actors out working the lines. With a little no sweat it stays in place for a few hours and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my daughters Halloween makeup and it worked perfectly! Yes, each individual color can and will come out. Yes, you will have to hold it while working(I actually found that easier anyways). Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t regularly use face paint, but I thought this stuff was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this stuff! Just keep your brush wet, and the paint goes on smooth and perfect.  I used baby wipes to clean up any mess and they worked perfectly for removing the paint that didn&#x27;t wash off in the shower. Yes, the colors are as vibrant as they appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing a beautiful easy to use product, so a newbie like me was able to do sugar skull makeup with ease.</li>
            <li> These are, by far, the best face paints we have ever used. The paint glides on effortlessly and the colors are beautiful. If you want superior high quality paints like the pros use, buy these. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a professional, I face paint for parties and events at my parents&#x27; local yacht club and this is the best paint I&#x27;ve used out of the three brands I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with colors popping out of the pack like someone else said, and I like the fact that the colors are replaceable--I&#x27;m always running out of red and white, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy single colors instead of an entirely new palette! I&#x27;ll stick with Wolfe brand. :)</li>
            <li> This is in comparison to all face paint products from your typical hobby store, or big name brand store including Snazaroo. This Wolfe color palette applies easier with one coat instead of several coats. The colors were noticeably better. Vibrant if I were to use one word. The kids loved it. The parents loved it. I was able to complete more faces in the same amount of time and with better results. I have not yet tried fab, tab or other name brand face paints but did consider them</li>
            <li> Some parents complain that it made children&#x27;s skin itchy. I used it on myself and didn&#x27;t have a problem. The black is exceptional in it&#x27;s ability to go on and be a bold color. Love it.</li>
            <li> This paint goes on smooth, blends well with the right sponges and last all night long and washes off easily. Great for professional looking work done by a amateur! This is not like the cheap paints you get at walmart and goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> love this, it draws smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to paint our faces for Halloween and Dia de los Muertos. I had so much fun being creative with this product without having to worry if the colors would run or crack. If you have a little water, make up sponges, and a couple paint brushes you are ready to go! I also bought a large pot of white by itself for the purpose of what I wanted to do, but I descovered that I might have been able to do it all with this kit alone. In other words, a little goes a long way, and the quality is so good you can wear it all day without having to worry about the paint fading, or getting oily, or getting dry and cracked. The pigments are very opaque and vibrant. This kit will probably last me two or more Halloween seasons, so it is well worth the money. Now I will ALWAYS buy WOLFE brand face paint! MY DAYS WITH CHEAP OIL-BASED HALLOWEEN PAINT ARE OVER!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these paints and I admit I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t go very far. Did two full face and neck make ups and it looks like I barely used them at all. The color trueness and fast set time, is the best I&#x27;ve seen from any product. Great product Wolfe!</li>
            <li> I have used some Wolfe Brothers paints before and bought this palette when the older one ran out. Although it has a larger variety of colors than most face paints, some of the colors are quite faint and you have to be very careful with how much water you use or the color will run a lot. That is not to say that these paints are not good, as a matter of fact of all the face paints I&#x27;ve used I like these a lot, pules they are not super pricey.</li>
            <li> These paints are high quality, and have definitely served their purpose for face paint.  My kids love them, and I appreciate the high quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit as advised by a makeup artist&#x27;s tutorial. I made up my face as a sort of dead bride with a Dias de Los Muertos type theme for Halloween.  It was easy to use and not too messy for a beginner.  I got a lot of compliments on my face.  I can&#x27;t wait to use some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I just love working with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Wolfe 12 Color Palette for 2 parties now.  It&#x27;s great for detail work and outlining/highlighting. The colors are bright and the paint goes on smooth. Each paint square pops off...this can be a good and bad thing I guess, depending on how you plan to use it.</li>
            <li> Still using these after a few months, great for practice, sugar skulls, pop art, etc</li>
            <li> There are a nice assortment of vivid colors. They don&#x27;t smear easily because they dry very fast, which can be a good thing- but it can be a problem with dry glitter. I may not be experienced enough to work with this texture. They are chalky when dry- more like powdered make-up- or dry tempera paint . The other brands are oilier/ waxier- which smear easier but - for me anyway - seem a bit easier to work with. Regardless of the texture you should know that these colors stain the skin.  I was so happy to get this new set for an upcoming face painting event - but frankly I don&#x27;t think I should use them on the kid&#x27;s faces because I know  the parents are going to have a very hard time getting it off of their skin. I did a practice run on my own hand and wasn&#x27;t able to wash it off completely- especially the darker colors. I had to scrub it off w/ a scouring pad- which I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to resort to if I had painted on my face. In all fairness though I haven&#x27;t been at it long and may not be the best judge of face paints- so they may work great for someone else...</li>
            <li> Seriously the best face paint I have used to date. Wolfe products are bright, smear resistant, and a little goes a long way! Great for face painting kids! The 2 brushes that come with this are awesome as well!</li>
            <li> These are THE BEST facepaints!</li>
            <li> For those that obviously don&#x27;t know, these are water based paints. While these contain a bit of wax for longer lasting paints, coming into contact with water while wearing them isn&#x27;t the best idea. I had painted my hands and it sucked it came off rather quickly when they get wet. Now if it&#x27;s just a bit of sweat or rain drizzle they will hold up better than any other well known paint brands. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend these for painting children because they do stain. Imagine my surprise after turning my face into a skeleton and washing it off! Not fun! For adults though, we want it to last all night and Wolfe gets the job done and the staining isn&#x27;t permenant and was gone in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find them difficult to use, my favorite thing about them is they are so much easier to blend colors than other paints. If you&#x27;re new to painting as one reviewer mentioned then of course you have to practice using them, all paints are different and Wolfe paint are different from others on the market. Other water based paints are easier to use, many don&#x27;t last as long or blend as well either. Depends on your clients and what you need your paint to do. If you don&#x27;t know how to use it, that&#x27;s not the paints fault.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a last resort for my halloween costume. I had been trying to use the cheap face paint from wal mart mixed in with my make up....it just wasn&#x27;t working. I bought this just 5 days before Halloween and immediately started to practice with it when it came in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I purchased this. The paint lasted all night and it was very easy to apply. I did not set it with powder and I did not put it on my lips. I used lipstick instead....I am excited for next Halloween!</li>
            <li> Very good quality face paint.&lt;br /&gt;It washed right off with water, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with sweating it off.&lt;br /&gt;It is a tad expensive but worth it. Really great starter set for somebody serious about face painting and a beginner/intermediate.</li>
            <li> Pros: This paint is very vibrant and provides amazing coverage. A little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;I painted everyone&#x27;s face in my group, including mine, before heading to a &#x27;Day of the Dead&#x27; celebration,&lt;br /&gt;and this paint stayed intact all day and evening. No discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Dark colors do not remove easily from face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone needing face paint. It&#x27;s so much better than the greasy paint sold at most stores during Holloween.</li>
            <li> This brand is amazing, I&#x27;m new at face painting &amp; this product makes me want to face paint as a side job. I tested it out on my leg and left it over night, &amp; it stayed on the next morning perfect</li>
