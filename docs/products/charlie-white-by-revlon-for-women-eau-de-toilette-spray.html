            <li>Fast shipping, very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Ok, so the stuff is inexpensive - and that&#x27;s a GOOD thing, nothing cheap about this product!</li>
            <li>product came very fast in great condition</li>
            <li>Charlie White is a great Toilette spray it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I what; however the packing wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>But you know what they say---if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, was a good price</li>
            <li>This is not the authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li>great item, received fast~  thank you</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother because this is her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>its a nice light neutral smell that has just a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>but if I told you how many she might want to get even</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>so i love it</li>
            <li>I love Charlie.  </li>
            <li>I see there are two more colors...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This was given as a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it up, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>The order arrived w/o problems and the fragrance is as lovely as I remembered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.   </li>
            <li>I saw un-prime ones that looked more original, i may take my chances with them instead</li>
            <li>maybe better than the original...</li>
            <li>She does use it, but the scent dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong; the bug spray scent that is.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>It is light, refreshing, and clean.</li>
            <li>The silver lid comes off easily too, feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Two gay guys stopped me on the sidewalk to say that I smelled fabulous.</li>
            <li>accurate product description.</li>
            <li>Need something more powerful but</li>
            <li>All Charlie fragrances are available in The United Kingdom.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great refreshing scent, love to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap drugstore perfume.  </li>
            <li>Im sure the real thing smells better than what i got in mail.</li>
            <li>I am just an original Charlie girl.  </li>
            <li>The one I originally bought was in a frosted bottle&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Now I will try and find a sample of the original.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product to purchase, but my favorite is Red</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I find that I can wear it in the daytime and at night, and it lasts the full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price was better than I&#x27;ve seen retail (for a while) and using Amazon Prime made it very affordable.</li>
            <li>Excellent choice for everyday wear!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product for my wife on a repeat basis because it&#x27;s inexpensive, carries a great scent, and is far superior to the small bottles you buy online or in retail stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets one star for shipping/delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>anyone who likes a beautifully fresh scent</li>
            <li>I laugh every time I&#x27;m passing the perfume isle</li>
            <li>I sure like the white... clean smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charlie White has a very light, fresh scent with a hint of flora.</li>
            <li>Good buy, like the delicate clean scent.</li>
            <li>i havent bought one yet, i love charlie white , i miss it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always the first item on her \\&quot;want\\&quot; list.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The first bottle sprayer now does not even spray out.  </li>
            <li>These items were exactly how they appear and exactly what they said they were.</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I had this perfume many years ago and decided to buy a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Charlie White Cologne Spray, Eau De Toilette for many years from Longs, CVS, etc.  </li>
            <li>then if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>This Charlie white smells fabulous !</li>
            <li>not expensive, so not a gamble, but</li>
            <li>Wore this several years ago, but this scent smelled more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; than I remembered it from before.</li>
            <li>Have been out of Charlie White for a while and am glad to have found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I honestly used to love this perfume, it&#x27;s elegant yet could be beachy or casual at the same time.</li>
            <li>Charlie White is a light crisp fragrance--great year round--not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>it smells nice but is not long lasting.</li>
            <li>its light, not as strong as the Blue or the Red.</li>
            <li>with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product as advertised and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Does NOT smell like the original Charlie white!</li>
            <li>I wore Charlie (the original, now Blue) for years and years...</li>
            <li>Charlie White should be a clear liquid in a frosted capped bottle not this huge inexpensive knock off.</li>
            <li>It was a much bigger bottle that I thought.it arrived quickly without any problems...</li>
            <li>I use this as my everyday fragrence and am always amazed at how many compliments I get.</li>
            <li>so i know how powerful and lasting the Charlie scent is....</li>
            <li>everyday perfume, love it</li>
            <li>I had been looking for this brand for a couple of years and can&#x27;t find it where I live.</li>
            <li>and she knows where I live.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, lasts long, and is a very pleasing fragrence...</li>
            <li>It has always been a very clear color and Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Not the same: &amp;#34;Production of Charlie Red and Charlie White was discontinued in North America in 2011, leaving the original Charlie as the only fragrance still available in this market.</li>
            <li>Fresh and stays long time.</li>
            <li>However, when I ordered it offline it smelled kind of stale (lost some of the sweetness) and the bottle I received wasn&#x27;t frosted glass like the classic bottle that you&#x27;d normally see in stores.</li>
            <li>Having a hard time finding my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume in any stores.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent, especially for the Summer.</li>
            <li>Soft scent, the scent</li>
            <li>This is made in the UK and smells much stronger and much differently than the one made in the US and sold during the holidays.</li>
            <li>Wow, after reading the comments, I thought I&#x27;d try, and do I ever like it..</li>
            <li>I use it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>a good colony composition makes us feel the smell of her natural makeup is glamorous young Bid valley to feel sorry charlie</li>
            <li>its better than alot of other more expensive scents i&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li>I expected the same fragrance as the original Charlie White.</li>
            <li>last a long time, hard to find, and so glad you can get it on amazon.</li>
            <li>At the first spray I could tell it is not true Charlie White.</li>

            <li> Having a hard time finding my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume in any stores.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent, especially for the Summer.</li>
            <li> Soft scent, the scent</li>
            <li> This is made in the UK and smells much stronger and much differently than the one made in the US and sold during the holidays.</li>
            <li> Wow, after reading the comments, I thought I&#x27;d try, and do I ever like it..</li>
            <li> I use it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> a good colony composition makes us feel the smell of her natural makeup is glamorous young Bid valley to feel sorry charlie</li>
            <li> its better than alot of other more expensive scents i&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> I expected the same fragrance as the original Charlie White.</li>
            <li> last a long time, hard to find, and so glad you can get it on amazon.</li>
            <li> At the first spray I could tell it is not true Charlie White.</li>
            <li> Also, in the ad picture the bottle is a frosty white which it should be,,,,the bottle I received is a clear bottle and does not smell ANYTHING LIKE what I have purchased in the past in a store.</li>
            <li> I noticed the cap looked strange.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Charlie White, it smells like wet cardboard.</li>
            <li> ..lasts long (I guess around 6 hours)</li>
            <li> For example, the same Charlie White that&#x27;s less than a tenth of this size is $15 at Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> Very dry and powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> my bottle was not filled up all the way, but for the low price i won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> well not really my thing but its a xmas gift</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I see alot of comments saying its not the same :/  </li>
            <li>  Smells like a bad cheap version.</li>
            <li> Old, yellow, stinks.</li>
            <li> The scent is off a little, and the name &amp;#34;Charlie White&amp;#34; does not have a &amp;#34;registered&amp;#34; symbol, nor are the letters in &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; identical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usally wear this cologne everyday.  </li>
            <li> Over the past few years I have complimented women on their perfume and when I asked what it was they told me, \\&quot;Charlie\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I got the kosher version...</li>
            <li> I have used Charlie for my years in the past</li>
            <li> Total disappointment</li>
            <li> /&gt;This appears to be a knock-off, which would explain the less expensive price.  </li>
            <li> Overall disappointed purchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received appeared to be new but the perfume inside smelled awful - like it had gone bad or something and nothing like the Charlie White</li>
            <li> First, the packaging was awful, wrapped up in a ugly green bubble wrapping paper, and the lid was lose, so that when I opened it, the fragrance almost fell to the floor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I purchased four bottles that I will be returning.</li>
            <li> May be fake.</li>
            <li> The perfume STINKS</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she was unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Can say nothing bad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Do not like it, disappointed with product.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like smaller frosted bottle.</li>
            <li> i havent bought one yet, i love charlie white , i miss it, i used to always get for christmas. But the picture on here, makes me worry that its not the same. i remember the bottle used to be frosted. I see alot of comments saying its not the same :/  I saw un-prime ones that looked more original, i may take my chances with them instead</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. It was exactly what I what; however the packing wasn&#x27;t great.  The perfume was out of the box. I had been looking for this brand for a couple of years and can&#x27;t find it where I live.</li>
            <li> This scent has become a traditional Christmas gift from me to my wife...it&#x27;s always the first item on her \\&quot;want\\&quot; list.  Amazon has the best prices and quickest shipping of anywhere that I have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I use this as my everyday fragrence and am always amazed at how many compliments I get. It&#x27;s not expensive, lasts long, and is a very pleasing fragrence... not overbearing, like those fragrances that make you want to vacate your seat because the woman next to you seems to have showered in it. I&#x27;m finding it harder to find in stores so thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I brought 2 bottles of this spray.  They do not smell like the ones I buy at local stores.  The first bottle sprayer now does not even spray out.  I just through it away.  The 2nd bottle is still in the box.  It smells awful.  I usally wear this cologne everyday.  I no longer can stand it.</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic fragrance. I noticed the cap looked strange. At the first spray I could tell it is not true Charlie White.</li>
            <li> Does NOT smell like the original Charlie white!  Smells like a bad cheap version.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS GOOD AND DOES NOT COST AN ARM AND A LEG.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE SCENT.    JESUS LOVES YOU...    Rom 5:6  Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.   Rom 5:7  No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.   Rom 5:8  But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</li>
            <li> These items were exactly how they appear and exactly what they said they were. Great shipping. Can say nothing bad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd all time favorite perfume. anyone who likes a beautifully fresh scent this is the perfume for you. the only problem with my purchase was the company who collected payment and shipped it (not amazon) did not ship it till 4 days after the estimated arrival so i did not get it till a lil over a week after the longest est. arrival date.</li>
            <li> Smells good and a good price</li>
            <li> is  too mild--fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay. Need something more powerful but&lt;br /&gt;the package was done nice. I rate it a 2 star.</li>
            <li> accurate product description. with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!  Doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and scent smells nice all day.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume many years ago and decided to buy a bigger bottle. I really like the scent, especially for the Summer. It is light, refreshing, and clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong; the bug spray scent that is. Amazon needs to get this out of their warehouses. Charlie White should be a clear liquid in a frosted capped bottle not this huge inexpensive knock off. And Amazon won&#x27;t let me return the item because it is flammable/hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets one star for shipping/delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok, so the stuff is inexpensive - and that&#x27;s a GOOD thing, nothing cheap about this product! I started wearing Charlie White as a teenager, and I find of all the fragrances I&#x27;ve tried, I keep coming back to this one. (I&#x27;m now in my mid-twenties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie White has a very light, fresh scent with a hint of flora. It&#x27;s very feminine and refreshing. I find that I can wear it in the daytime and at night, and it lasts the full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I wonder if the scent is out of date - until last week, when I was out for sushi with a friend. Two gay guys stopped me on the sidewalk to say that I smelled fabulous. From two guys uninterested in picking up girls? Now that&#x27;s a compliment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent, and I hope Amazon continues to carry it!</li>
            <li> I expected the same fragrance as the original Charlie White. This is not! The perfume STINKS and I cannot even wear it. I&#x27;ll end up throwing the bottle away as I&#x27;ve thrown out the packing slip and can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for my wife on a repeat basis because it&#x27;s inexpensive, carries a great scent, and is far superior to the small bottles you buy online or in retail stores. For example, the same Charlie White that&#x27;s less than a tenth of this size is $15 at Wal Mart. I laugh every time I&#x27;m passing the perfume isle knowing I&#x27;m saving a fortune buying it here.</li>
            <li> Great service! The product arrived quickly, was a good price and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume online because of the great price. But you know what they say---if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The item is not the same as the perfume in stores. It smells like a horrible knock-off. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Charlie White, it smells like wet cardboard. It&#x27;s awful</li>
            <li> I have been buying Charlie White Cologne Spray, Eau De Toilette for many years from Longs, CVS, etc.  It has always been a very clear color and Made in the USA.  Contents of what I recieved from Amazon is a yellow/green color and made in the UK.  The scent is off a little, and the name &amp;#34;Charlie White&amp;#34; does not have a &amp;#34;registered&amp;#34; symbol, nor are the letters in &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This appears to be a knock-off, which would explain the less expensive price.  Unfortunately, I purchased four bottles that I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Old, yellow, stinks. Not like it used to be. Girlfriend threw it out.</li>
            <li> great item, received fast~  thank you</li>
            <li> Soft scent, the scent last a long time, hard to find, and so glad you can get it on amazon. Love it, Would make a good gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I honestly used to love this perfume, it&#x27;s elegant yet could be beachy or casual at the same time. However, when I ordered it offline it smelled kind of stale (lost some of the sweetness) and the bottle I received wasn&#x27;t frosted glass like the classic bottle that you&#x27;d normally see in stores. So I would&#x27;t recommend buying this perfume online, they sell it at Walgreens around Xmas time for about $10 anyways, so grab yourself a bottle then if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> Not the same: &amp;#34;Production of Charlie Red and Charlie White was discontinued in North America in 2011, leaving the original Charlie as the only fragrance still available in this market. All Charlie fragrances are available in The United Kingdom.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Charlie White is a great Toilette spray it smells very nice. its light, not as strong as the Blue or the Red. It is a nice product to purchase, but my favorite is Red</li>
            <li> Having a hard time finding my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume in any stores. Product as advertised and fast shipping. thanks!</li>
            <li> Charlie White is a light crisp fragrance--great year round--not overpowering.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve ordered several times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because this is her favorite perfume. It smelt nothing like it was suppressed to. Do not buy perfume online.</li>
            <li> my bottle was not filled up all the way, but for the low price i won&#x27;t complain. its a nice light neutral smell that has just a touch of sweetness. its better than alot of other more expensive scents i&#x27;ve smelled. so for the price, its very good. yes.</li>
            <li> This is made in the UK and smells much stronger and much differently than the one made in the US and sold during the holidays.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for everyday wear!!</li>
            <li> Idk if this is a &amp;#34;bump off&amp;#34; but it does not smell like it does in a store. Also, in the ad picture the bottle is a frosty white which it should be,,,,the bottle I received is a clear bottle and does not smell ANYTHING LIKE what I have purchased in the past in a store. Total disappointment</li>
            <li> May be fake. Not sure I got the kosher version...it has the name, but it&#x27;s not in the frosted bottle.</li>
            <li> i just got this product today and it smells like alcohol! very disappointed. Im sure the real thing smells better than what i got in mail.</li>
            <li> It was a much bigger bottle that I thought.it arrived quickly without any problems...</li>
            <li> always smells so good people ask what I am wearing</li>
            <li> This Charlie white smells fabulous !</li>
            <li> Good buy, like the delicate clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love this ! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing Charlie White for years but if I told you how many she might want to get even and she knows where I live.</li>
            <li> product came very fast in great condition it is an awesome product God bless you keep up the good work</li>
            <li> well not really my thing but its a xmas gift i have to give to my mom cause she likes this kind of skunk oil</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AL WELL AS BEARS MY NAME</li>
            <li> This is my mothers all time perfume, I buy one for her every Christmas because we cannot find it here in my area locally.</li>
            <li> This is a white wash version of Charlie...I have used Charlie for my years in the past so i know how powerful and lasting the Charlie scent is....This one is the total opposite.....Charlie by revlon is no longer a brand.....wasted my money</li>
            <li> my wife loves it so i love it</li>
            <li> I am a Charlie girl.  I love Charlie.  But  I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one.  I kept it.  Hopefully I can give it away.  I am just an original Charlie girl.  It arrive prompt.  packaging was good.  Just not my smell</li>
            <li> I wore Charlie (the original, now Blue) for years and years... finally couldn&#x27;t find it around here.  I bought some on Amazon, and didn&#x27;t remember that it was called Blue, so was reading them all.  Wow, after reading the comments, I thought I&#x27;d try, and do I ever like it.. maybe better than the original... maybe.  I see there are two more colors... going to order them too...not expensive, so not a gamble, but I sure like the white... clean smell.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received appeared to be new but the perfume inside smelled awful - like it had gone bad or something and nothing like the Charlie White I remember.</li>
            <li> I think they have changed the formula for this. It isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be. This was a gift for my mother and she was unhappy with it. She does use it, but the scent dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are a Charlie fan .. A must have and price is good ..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Fresh and stays long time.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li> Not the same product as the one offered seasonally at Christmas...different bottle, different smell.  Do not like it, disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> ~Always loved this perfume for change up~Good product,great price~Your the best Amazon!!..Thank you~</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Charlie - great retro smell.</li>
            <li> WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> First, the packaging was awful, wrapped up in a ugly green bubble wrapping paper, and the lid was lose, so that when I opened it, the fragrance almost fell to the floor. The silver lid comes off easily too, feels cheaply made. The smell is not as described, and it only lasts for 50 minutes or so. Overall disappointed purchase.</li>
            <li> smells nice..lasts long (I guess around 6 hours) and it&#x27;s a good one for the price. I use it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all the color and smell partum is a remarkable colony of a well being and security to those who uses it, is not cloying, like a good colony composition makes us feel the smell of her natural makeup is glamorous young Bid valley to feel sorry charlie</li>
            <li> I do not like this Charlie White at all.  It does not smell good.  The one I originally bought was in a frosted bottle&lt;br /&gt;and it smelled nothing like this one...</li>
            <li> Product isn&#x27;t as described very disappointed!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter in law loves this fragrance and I purchased it for her for Christmas.  It was number one on her Amazon wish list.  Awesome to know I got something she wanted. Had it gift wrapped and shipped to their home.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing scent, love to wear it everyday. it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Wore this several years ago, but this scent smelled more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; than I remembered it from before. I&#x27;ll use it up, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Have been out of Charlie White for a while and am glad to have found it at Amazon.  The order arrived w/o problems and the fragrance is as lovely as I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than I&#x27;ve seen retail (for a while) and using Amazon Prime made it very affordable.</li>
            <li> it smells nice but is not long lasting. kinda like a body splash.</li>
            <li> A very light smell that lasts all day! Very good price!</li>
            <li> everyday perfume, love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume hoping to save some $&#x27;s, but I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t smell so great.  Very dry and powdery scent.  Not at all what I expected.  I didn&#x27;t like Charlie when it came out because everyone was wearing it and it was cheap drugstore perfume.  Over the past few years I have complimented women on their perfume and when I asked what it was they told me, \\&quot;Charlie\\&quot;.  Now I will try and find a sample of the original.</li>
            <li> No scent, it&#x27;s like a mix of water and alcohol.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very pleasant smell. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the smell of this product. It smelled like gasoline was added into the bottle and I have had this product several of times and it never smelled that way. It made my skin itch and I have never had that reaction before.</li>
