            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for the better part of 16 or so years.</li>
            <li>but she still went out of her way to make sure that I got an undamaged product in a timely fashion and she even offered to refund my money if I changed my mind about the purchase.</li>
            <li>I get the most compliments on this perfume whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance that never disappoints.</li>
            <li>you smell cookies or marshmellows?&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>Such a great warm fragrance, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>This vanilla smells very sweet, it reminds me of a sugar cookie.</li>
            <li>Also included a free gift sample and hand-written note which was super nice.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a pretty nice size for the price as well.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I am all about the gourmand!</li>
            <li>It is a true gourmand scent, so if you don&#x27;t like very sweet smells this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Light scented fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a great vanilla perfume, when I wear it people tell me I smell like cake mix or something similar.</li>
            <li>The scent of this perfume is great for women who do not want to smell like a middle school locker room!</li>
            <li>Anyways, the scent is not lasting or remarkable in any way.  </li>
            <li>Sweet vanilla with no floral tones.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for days when you want just a subtle hint of fresh-baked cookie fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and absolutely love the big bottle!!!</li>
            <li>smells like lucky charm marshmallows..</li>
            <li>Simple vanilla scent:) just love it</li>
            <li>I love this scent and am so glad it comes in a larger size!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much! :-)</li>
            <li>I had a slight moment of panic when I started to run out, so I was so glad to find it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>My best kept secret.</li>
            <li>Super Fast Delivery !</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of vanilla without smelling too sweet or fake.</li>
            <li>I like LaVanilla much more even though the rollerball is so much smaller</li>
            <li>it gave such more of a vanilla impact.  </li>
            <li>I bought a real vanilla bean and stuck it in the bottle hoping that would help.  </li>
            <li>She immediately resent the shipment and was very apologetic and prompt with her responses.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order from them again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li>Light but lasting, and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>basically it smells delicious and sugary but in an ever so slightly synthetic way..doesn&#x27;t last a long time on my skin maybe 3 hours max</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original from years ago.</li>
            <li>The perfume has a pretty amber color in a clear bottle with a vintage looking label.</li>
            <li>i have allergies to chemicals and can only wear this yummy sweet smelling potion.</li>
            <li>highly unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the sugary side, but I have yet to find a better plain vanilla after years of searching.  </li>
            <li>Soft vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>I completely understood that the damage to the packages was not within her control</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments, I&#x27;m usually not a huge vanilla fan, this is the only vanilla I wear.</li>
            <li>Rich but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It also has a bit of a strong alcohol smell at first, with a faint cotton candy scent near the end.  </li>
            <li>This is my third bottle, and while the other bottles had a nice, clear but not overwhelming fragrance, this smells like nothing but rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>so apparently it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m accustomed to it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> only thing I can think is that somehow this is a watered-down version b/c it says &amp;#34;use for dry skin&amp;#34; on the info.  </li>
            <li> The other does not smell the same as the Vanille Eau de Toilette that comes in the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a natural vanilla flavor that isn&#x27;t too sweet or artificial smelling.  </li>
            <li> After the 2nd bottle arrived broken she ensured the next bottle was double wrapped with extra padding and they used a different carrier.</li>
            <li> The colors were also different, but that might be due to the age of my other bottle, which is a few years old.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> One bottle came broken with no product in it because it had leaked completely out and into the box.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at a little mom and pop type beauty supply store in CA.</li>
            <li> was disappointed that it seems to fade fast, but I get comments and compliments long after I think it&#x27;s faded</li>
            <li> just not  a good perfume for my taste.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not happy with this product on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells weird.</li>

            <li> Purchased 2 bottles. One bottle came broken with no product in it because it had leaked completely out and into the box. The other does not smell the same as the Vanille Eau de Toilette that comes in the smaller bottle. highly unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Light scented fragrance. Perfect for warm summer months!</li>
            <li> My best kept secret.Pure,sweet,long lasting vanilla bean</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Rich but not too heavy. I get a lot of compliments on it :)</li>
            <li> smells like lucky charm marshmallows.. basically it smells delicious and sugary but in an ever so slightly synthetic way..doesn&#x27;t last a long time on my skin maybe 3 hours max</li>
            <li> Simple vanilla scent:) just love it</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original from years ago. Smells weird. NOT VANILLA!</li>
            <li> Sweet vanilla with no floral tones.  I&#x27;m not a fan of floral at all, and this is almost perfect.  It&#x27;s a bit on the sugary side, but I have yet to find a better plain vanilla after years of searching.  It reminds me of the snow ice cream my grandma made for me as a child.  Vanilla, sugar, milk, and snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that it seems to fade fast, but I get comments and compliments long after I think it&#x27;s faded so apparently it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m accustomed to it.  Most comments are along the lines of, something smells yummy, or i smell food/cookies&#x27;.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Such a great warm fragrance, I get so many compliments. Great seller too.</li>
            <li> Yummmmy !! I get compliments daily of how I smell like all different kinds of things when I have this on :)) it&#x27;s a yummy vanilla like homemade vanilla icecream with a hint of Carmel :))))</li>
            <li> This is the best and only vanilla perfume to buy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of my favourite scents - not too heavy or cloying. Perfect for days when you want just a subtle hint of fresh-baked cookie fragrance.</li>
            <li> Soft vanilla scent.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent. Perfect amount of vanilla without smelling too sweet or fake. I&#x27;m definitely getting another. Packaging was also perfect - bubble wrap and packing peanuts. Also included a free gift sample and hand-written note which was super nice.</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla ice cream. Skin scent that smells beautiful. Will lull you to sleep.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and thought I would love it. I like vanilla based perfumes. We decided to use it as bathroom spray....just not  a good perfume for my taste.</li>
            <li> This is a great every day scent. It has a burnt vanilla smell and I am often told I smell like cookies or cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Every time I wear it my boyfriend asks if I baked cookies that day... I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a good sign. The seller is awesome, got a handwritten card and two lovely samples- felt very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this delicious scent.  People at work sniff the air questioningly asking what that appealing scent is.  Some think it&#x27;s cookies, cotton candy or even chocolate!  I finally tell them it&#x27;s me!  It&#x27;s become my signature scent.....and it&#x27;s nice knowing it&#x27;s unique and pleasant to everyone.  I never want to be without it!</li>
            <li> Always love this perfume. Not too pungent, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume ever. i have allergies to chemicals and can only wear this yummy sweet smelling potion. i use it all day, all night. i love it!</li>
            <li> Not really happy with this one.  I wanted a nice Vanilla and I read so many reviews on this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can think is that somehow this is a watered-down version b/c it says &amp;#34;use for dry skin&amp;#34; on the info.  Anyways, the scent is not lasting or remarkable in any way.  I like LaVanilla much more even though the rollerball is so much smaller it gave such more of a vanilla impact.  I bought a real vanilla bean and stuck it in the bottle hoping that would help.  it didn&#x27;t.  Won&#x27;t get this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was top-notch, though:  they sent tons of samles and an awesome catalogue with the order.  I&#x27;m just not happy with this product on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna smell like a vanilla cookie then get LaVanilla and pass this one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again?  No</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle, and while the other bottles had a nice, clear but not overwhelming fragrance, this smells like nothing but rubbing alcohol. It seems like there is some variability in the formulations, despite the ingredient lists being identical. The colors were also different, but that might be due to the age of my other bottle, which is a few years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for the better part of 16 or so years. I used to buy it at a little mom and pop type beauty supply store in CA. When I moved to TX I had a slight moment of panic when I started to run out, so I was so glad to find it on Amazon!! I get so many compliments, I&#x27;m usually not a huge vanilla fan, this is the only vanilla I wear. I did have issues with the shipment, the bottle arrived damaged, not once but  twice! I emailed the seller with photos and Emily took care of everything. She immediately resent the shipment and was very apologetic and prompt with her responses. I completely understood that the damage to the packages was not within her control but she still went out of her way to make sure that I got an undamaged product in a timely fashion and she even offered to refund my money if I changed my mind about the purchase. After the 2nd bottle arrived broken she ensured the next bottle was double wrapped with extra padding and they used a different carrier. I will absolutely order from them again.</li>
            <li> watery - do not recommend buy the regular Vanille. This smells like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments on this perfume whenever I wear it. It is a true gourmand scent, so if you don&#x27;t like very sweet smells this isn&#x27;t for you. Lucky for me, I am all about the gourmand! This is a great vanilla perfume, when I wear it people tell me I smell like cake mix or something similar. It lasts all day, and you only need a little bit. This bottle will last a long time. It&#x27;s a great price at $23 for 3.3 oz. it&#x27;s acutally a steal! The seller is awesome, she sent me some samples and a catalog of products from the store. Highly recommend this perfume! My fiance tells me he loves it every time I wear it and if that isn&#x27;t enough of a reason for me to buy out the stock, I don&#x27;t know what is!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance that never disappoints. Light but lasting, and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is great for women who do not want to smell like a middle school locker room! As a vanilla lover, I am always on the hunt for a yummy smelling vanilla perfume. This vanilla smells very sweet, it reminds me of a sugar cookie. It also has a bit of a strong alcohol smell at first, with a faint cotton candy scent near the end.  The perfume has a pretty amber color in a clear bottle with a vintage looking label. The bottle is a pretty nice size for the price as well. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and am so glad it comes in a larger size!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years.  It is a natural vanilla flavor that isn&#x27;t too sweet or artificial smelling.  Often, I will hear &amp;#34;do you smell cookies or marshmellows?&amp;#34; :)</li>
