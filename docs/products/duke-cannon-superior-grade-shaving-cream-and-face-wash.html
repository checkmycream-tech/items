            <li>This shaving cream is superior in every way.</li>
            <li>It feels good, it smells good, and it&#x27;s loaded with moisturizer</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I tried Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I squirt in a nickel sized dollop of Superior Grade, and make up a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>It lathers perfectly, provides a smooth glide for the razor, smells great and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed after the shave.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with my first Duke shave.</li>
            <li>Top notch stuff!</li>
            <li>Leaves a great smooth shave and leaves my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I re-wet my face with some warm water, and lather with the brush.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>The form (peaks) of the lather also remained nice when adding additional water to my brush.  </li>
            <li>It will remain warm and so will the lather.</li>
            <li>It does not come off overly strong smelling, which is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>You will get a nice warm shave and there is nothing more luxurious in the morning.</li>
            <li>The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve encountered so far.</li>
            <li>This product gives a good smooth shave and I like the scent.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed a better side by side comparison.</li>
            <li>Subjectively, my skin feels better when I use a nicer shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the shave when I use it, which is most every day.</li>
            <li>Razor glides over it ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams and gels, but I continued to look around because I never had that excellent shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get better mileage from those products</li>
            <li>The water in your brush will be an appropriate water-to-cream ratio.</li>
            <li>That is because this cream does not have parahydroxybenzoates, a preservative in cosmetics and as stated before, this cream is probably better for you.</li>
            <li>Today, my best possible shave includes Duke Cannon shaving</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>have been using this shaving cream for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>But, if you are using a DE blade (personally I think the best are Kai blades from Japan)</li>
            <li>you need a much better cream.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a very clean and close shave when I use it.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like the price, I was able to find it elsewhere for $14 free shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes for the most comfortable shave I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>The amount of blades becomes even more significant if you happen to be a yeti.</li>
            <li>It lathers quite easily for me in a bowl.  </li>
            <li>Rinses easily from the the razor or brush.</li>
            <li>Most reviews have only great things to say about duke cannon.</li>
            <li>It minimizes my razor bumps and does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I strongly disagree.</li>
            <li>Smells good, you get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Smooth skin, easy routine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it was a huge difference between the two halves of my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so smooth and slippery</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I use a double edge safety razor, but this would work great whatever you shave with.</li>
            <li>I tried almost every cream and gel available.  </li>
            <li>If you are using a 5 blade cartridge like Gillette Fusion or Harry&#x27;s blades you can use almost any shaving cream and &amp;#34;get by&amp;#34;, i.e. fairly comfortable and no cuts.</li>
            <li>In short, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Does not make as good as lather as the Sutton Old Spice cream</li>
            <li>The lather is easy with the quick one flick of the wrist on the brush.</li>
            <li>There are, in my opinion many products in this price range that outperform duke cannon mainly because they are more consistent offer better protection.</li>
            <li>The shave cream is rich, and makes for a close shave.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products and different combinations for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li>I take the brush out, drain the mug, and give one good flick of my wrist to empty the brush of most of the retained water.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you apply it directly to your face out of the tube, but if you use a shaving brush, it lathers and foams quite nicely.</li>
            <li>So, don&#x27;t worry about the grease factor if you use a brush to lather as I have found this product to foam and air up more than Proraso, Musgo Real, Truefitt and Hill, Dreadnought (Bluebeards Revenge), or The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>If you feel you cannot properly gauge the amount you need for a good shave, you should try a cream that comes in jar.</li>
            <li>tried Dreadnought shaving cream recently because I heard it was good stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild which I also prefer.</li>
            <li>On my first use i saw a huge difference in the quality of lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how far just a little went.</li>
            <li>which gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I feel this shaving cream is worth a try if you are in the market.g cream</li>
            <li>is worth a try if you are in the market.</li>
            <li>but I thought this was worth my time because I like the stuff.</li>
            <li>The proof is in what&#x27;s happening right at the surface of the face.</li>
            <li>but it couldn&#x27;t create a nice thick foam no matter how many times i tried.  </li>
            <li>got a regular old mug, and right after my shower I put the brush in the mug and run the hot water to fill the mug and get the brush good and hot.  </li>
            <li>Well, smelling this was pretty uneventful.</li>
            <li>When I first put this product on my face</li>
            <li>It felt like it gave me a closer shave than the Hydroplane and left my skin feeling better.</li>
            <li>This is my first venture to a barbershop quality cream that I&#x27;m using on a brush.</li>
            <li>and I think it does a better job of not only lubricating the face but also standing up the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>This was the first creme i purchased along with a merkur 34c razor and parker safety razor</li>
            <li>I first fill the sink with hot water, and drop my mug in it.</li>
            <li>I fill the mug halfway with hot water and drop my brush in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for you actually.</li>
            <li>Soak your brush and mug in hot water while you shower.</li>
            <li>the mug (un-submerged) in the hot water.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by my first shave.</li>
            <li>I could not get this product to lather well or consistently.</li>
            <li>Smaller amounts and is performs better.</li>
            <li>so you have to apply some more (no big deal, with the almond size amount you put in the mug</li>
            <li>Get a mug and a badger brush and even if you are using the 5 blade standard razors this will give you a better shave.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, smells great, gives you a crazy good shave and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The right shaving cream is just as important in wet shaving as the right blade.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if your water is different than mine and you have a brush that holds exactly the right amount of water for this product, you might get a nice lather as other people appear to have gotten.  </li>
            <li>That could very well be &amp;</li>
            <li>but seems to protect the skin very well while shaving.</li>
            <li>Definitely much nicer than aerosol creams.</li>
            <li>If there is one, it&#x27;s very faint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like grease and really clogged my razor up</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be using it because of the greasy feeling and the fact that I was spending too much time clearing my razor.</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>The whole process of shaving takes me 10 - 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Guaranteed you&#x27;ll revisit your gripe about figuring out how much you need out of a tube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up with this product because the Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club is only available with a blade subscription.</li>
            <li>Like I said how much foam is sticking out from your face and how much &amp;#34;peaking&amp;#34; of the foam when you lather in the mug doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Billy Jealousy products and very rarely do I stray from their stuff.</li>
            <li>In shaving with a DE blade you are VERY lightly drawing a very sharp (in Kai blades case</li>
            <li>I use a single blade Merkur and have an okay sliver-tip badger brush and when paired with Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream and a drop or two of shaving oil, the shave cannot be beat as far as comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li>and I needed to run a lot of HOT water on the razor to clear the blades.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands due to my neck being very sensitive, and I still have not yet found one that works as well as Nancy Boy cream.</li>
            <li>As my facial hair grew back the difference became more pronounced.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a decent slickness</li>
            <li>If I want a little more lather, I just dip the edge of my brush in the water and this stuff lathers up again and again while I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather built up much easier with a small amount of product and the peaks are much more defined.  </li>
            <li>(bought new blades, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sadly, I am not going back to Billy&#x27;s Hydroplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need half a dozen blades for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Lathers quickly with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>skin is on the sensitive side</li>
            <li>so I have to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li>I just put some on my face and/or onto my brush and then lather up directly on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to switch back to the trusty electric when I found Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have an issue with in grown hairs, and so far, this product helps to prevent those from happening.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your face soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>it just sometimes gets near your lips.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Threw it out wondering how much was left in it.  </li>
            <li>had a few more shaves left in my bottle of Hydroplane, but I had to try this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that the shave is any better or worse than using a product like Barbasol, but the smell is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>Most of them left my skin greasy, dried out or chaffed.  </li>
            <li>beginners or people who are unwilling to gamble on this product, i would recommend something that is more forgiving to lather such as razorock xxx or proraso green.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I do prefer Truefitt and Hill 1805 over this product as I have found Duke Cannon to foam and air more than I prefer, which I find ironic taking into consideration the poor review about the grease factor.</li>
            <li>I am pretty skeptical when something seems to be better than a Billy Jealousy product.</li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard, but after shaving with Duke Cannon, my face is as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>I try a new grooming product I always like to open it up and take a whiff.</li>
            <li>The shave itself was smooth and my safety razor had no problem with it, though I could see that a standard razor might have trouble with it.</li>
            <li>The Duke side felt a little more slick while shaving, but the real comparison is how my face feels after.</li>
            <li>Gillette Foamy especially or even Barbasol has thick foam which looks great like whipped cream but very little slickness, protection at the level of the skin.</li>
            <li>It is still slick enough for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>yes i got more lather, but the quality was still poor and finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing a tub of razorock xxx with tallow, which is an italian soft soap.  </li>
            <li>On the against the grain-I wet my hand and reactivate the lather for like 2 seconds before, and I&#x27;ve again got a great slick lather that&#x27;s not too thick to see the remaining hair on my face that needs to be shaved off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be the best out there, but it is far from the worst.</li>
            <li>Also, this lather does not dry out on my face before i finish my pass, which is what i consider</li>
            <li>neck was destroyed the first few times I shaved.  </li>
            <li>I started reading up on wet shaving, and learned some new techniques to keep the burn tolerable.  </li>
            <li>When it is right is fairly slick.</li>
            <li>The whole process takes less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Slightly too much water</li>
            <li>Obviously too much water with any product compromises performance but with Duke Cannon there seems to be little room for error where others have wider tolerances.</li>

            <li> But, if you are using a DE blade (personally I think the best are Kai blades from Japan)</li>
            <li> you need a much better cream.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a very clean and close shave when I use it.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like the price, I was able to find it elsewhere for $14 free shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes for the most comfortable shave I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> The amount of blades becomes even more significant if you happen to be a yeti.</li>
            <li> It lathers quite easily for me in a bowl.  </li>
            <li> Rinses easily from the the razor or brush.</li>
            <li> Most reviews have only great things to say about duke cannon.</li>
            <li> It minimizes my razor bumps and does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I strongly disagree.</li>
            <li> Smells good, you get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Smooth skin, easy routine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it was a huge difference between the two halves of my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so smooth and slippery</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I use a double edge safety razor, but this would work great whatever you shave with.</li>
            <li> I tried almost every cream and gel available.  </li>
            <li> If you are using a 5 blade cartridge like Gillette Fusion or Harry&#x27;s blades you can use almost any shaving cream and &amp;#34;get by&amp;#34;, i.e. fairly comfortable and no cuts.</li>
            <li> In short, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Does not make as good as lather as the Sutton Old Spice cream</li>
            <li> The lather is easy with the quick one flick of the wrist on the brush.</li>
            <li> There are, in my opinion many products in this price range that outperform duke cannon mainly because they are more consistent offer better protection.</li>
            <li> The shave cream is rich, and makes for a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products and different combinations for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> I take the brush out, drain the mug, and give one good flick of my wrist to empty the brush of most of the retained water.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you apply it directly to your face out of the tube, but if you use a shaving brush, it lathers and foams quite nicely.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t worry about the grease factor if you use a brush to lather as I have found this product to foam and air up more than Proraso, Musgo Real, Truefitt and Hill, Dreadnought (Bluebeards Revenge), or The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> If you feel you cannot properly gauge the amount you need for a good shave, you should try a cream that comes in jar.</li>
            <li> tried Dreadnought shaving cream recently because I heard it was good stuff.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild which I also prefer.</li>
            <li> On my first use i saw a huge difference in the quality of lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how far just a little went.</li>
            <li> which gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I feel this shaving cream is worth a try if you are in the market.g cream</li>
            <li> is worth a try if you are in the market.</li>
            <li> but I thought this was worth my time because I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> The proof is in what&#x27;s happening right at the surface of the face.</li>
            <li> but it couldn&#x27;t create a nice thick foam no matter how many times i tried.  </li>
            <li> got a regular old mug, and right after my shower I put the brush in the mug and run the hot water to fill the mug and get the brush good and hot.  </li>
            <li> Well, smelling this was pretty uneventful.</li>
            <li> When I first put this product on my face</li>
            <li> It felt like it gave me a closer shave than the Hydroplane and left my skin feeling better.</li>
            <li> This is my first venture to a barbershop quality cream that I&#x27;m using on a brush.</li>
            <li> and I think it does a better job of not only lubricating the face but also standing up the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> This was the first creme i purchased along with a merkur 34c razor and parker safety razor</li>
            <li> I first fill the sink with hot water, and drop my mug in it.</li>
            <li> I fill the mug halfway with hot water and drop my brush in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for you actually.</li>
            <li> Soak your brush and mug in hot water while you shower.</li>
            <li> the mug (un-submerged) in the hot water.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by my first shave.</li>
            <li> I could not get this product to lather well or consistently.</li>
            <li> Smaller amounts and is performs better.</li>
            <li> so you have to apply some more (no big deal, with the almond size amount you put in the mug</li>
            <li> Get a mug and a badger brush and even if you are using the 5 blade standard razors this will give you a better shave.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, smells great, gives you a crazy good shave and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The right shaving cream is just as important in wet shaving as the right blade.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if your water is different than mine and you have a brush that holds exactly the right amount of water for this product, you might get a nice lather as other people appear to have gotten.  </li>
            <li> That could very well be &amp;</li>
            <li> but seems to protect the skin very well while shaving.</li>
            <li> Definitely much nicer than aerosol creams.</li>
            <li> If there is one, it&#x27;s very faint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like grease and really clogged my razor up</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be using it because of the greasy feeling and the fact that I was spending too much time clearing my razor.</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> The whole process of shaving takes me 10 - 12 minutes.</li>
            <li> Guaranteed you&#x27;ll revisit your gripe about figuring out how much you need out of a tube.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up with this product because the Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club is only available with a blade subscription.</li>
            <li> Like I said how much foam is sticking out from your face and how much &amp;#34;peaking&amp;#34; of the foam when you lather in the mug doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Billy Jealousy products and very rarely do I stray from their stuff.</li>
            <li> In shaving with a DE blade you are VERY lightly drawing a very sharp (in Kai blades case</li>
            <li> I use a single blade Merkur and have an okay sliver-tip badger brush and when paired with Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream and a drop or two of shaving oil, the shave cannot be beat as far as comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> and I needed to run a lot of HOT water on the razor to clear the blades.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands due to my neck being very sensitive, and I still have not yet found one that works as well as Nancy Boy cream.</li>
            <li> As my facial hair grew back the difference became more pronounced.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a decent slickness</li>
            <li> If I want a little more lather, I just dip the edge of my brush in the water and this stuff lathers up again and again while I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather built up much easier with a small amount of product and the peaks are much more defined.  </li>
            <li> (bought new blades, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I am not going back to Billy&#x27;s Hydroplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need half a dozen blades for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Lathers quickly with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> skin is on the sensitive side</li>
            <li> so I have to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li> I just put some on my face and/or onto my brush and then lather up directly on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to switch back to the trusty electric when I found Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with in grown hairs, and so far, this product helps to prevent those from happening.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your face soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> it just sometimes gets near your lips.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Threw it out wondering how much was left in it.  </li>
            <li> had a few more shaves left in my bottle of Hydroplane, but I had to try this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that the shave is any better or worse than using a product like Barbasol, but the smell is much nicer.  </li>
            <li> Most of them left my skin greasy, dried out or chaffed.  </li>
            <li> beginners or people who are unwilling to gamble on this product, i would recommend something that is more forgiving to lather such as razorock xxx or proraso green.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I do prefer Truefitt and Hill 1805 over this product as I have found Duke Cannon to foam and air more than I prefer, which I find ironic taking into consideration the poor review about the grease factor.</li>
            <li> I am pretty skeptical when something seems to be better than a Billy Jealousy product.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, but after shaving with Duke Cannon, my face is as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> I try a new grooming product I always like to open it up and take a whiff.</li>
            <li> The shave itself was smooth and my safety razor had no problem with it, though I could see that a standard razor might have trouble with it.</li>
            <li> The Duke side felt a little more slick while shaving, but the real comparison is how my face feels after.</li>
            <li> Gillette Foamy especially or even Barbasol has thick foam which looks great like whipped cream but very little slickness, protection at the level of the skin.</li>
            <li> It is still slick enough for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> yes i got more lather, but the quality was still poor and finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing a tub of razorock xxx with tallow, which is an italian soft soap.  </li>
            <li> On the against the grain-I wet my hand and reactivate the lather for like 2 seconds before, and I&#x27;ve again got a great slick lather that&#x27;s not too thick to see the remaining hair on my face that needs to be shaved off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be the best out there, but it is far from the worst.</li>
            <li> Also, this lather does not dry out on my face before i finish my pass, which is what i consider</li>
            <li> neck was destroyed the first few times I shaved.  </li>
            <li> I started reading up on wet shaving, and learned some new techniques to keep the burn tolerable.  </li>
            <li> When it is right is fairly slick.</li>
            <li> The whole process takes less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Slightly too much water</li>
            <li> Obviously too much water with any product compromises performance but with Duke Cannon there seems to be little room for error where others have wider tolerances.</li>
            <li> If i put even slightly too much water, the lather totally loses form and if i don&#x27;t put that much water, the lather does not build up and also dries out on my face before i even get through a pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;Tends to evaporate after only a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gels for a long time but thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard which grows in quickly</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, and it is very &amp;#34;slick,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I decided to give traditional wet shaving a go.  </li>
            <li> This is the same technique I&#x27;ve used all along with other shaving creams and it has served me well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is completely non-greasy but slick.  </li>
            <li> I have enough lather left over to revisit my neck with a J-hook technique as there are always a few little hairs that escaped my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes too much to do a proper job and is too expensive for how much one has to use.</li>
            <li> I use just a tiny bit of the product with a few drips of water.  </li>
            <li> In your slightly wet mug, squeeze an amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have converted to wet shaving with the badger brush, mug and even now use a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> The next shaving day I decided to do a half and half test.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but in this case I wanted to clear the air on the negative review about the product being greasy.</li>
            <li> I found out about Duke Cannon when I was looking around online for some other things, so I decided to give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> If you feel the cream dries quicker on your face compared to other creams, you would be correct.</li>
            <li> After reading that hard water can require larger amounts of creme, i tried doubling the amount of creme to 2 or 3 times the size of an almond.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for a few years and tried Duke cannon five or six times before writing this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t look thick; yes, it may evaporate or not last until the end of your shave in places</li>
            <li> I covered half of my face with Billy&#x27;s Hydroplane and the other half with Duke&#x27;s Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> If you feel it clogs your razor, then you should come down in the number of blades you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly thicker cream</li>
            <li> Cremo Cream, which is half the price.  </li>
            <li> very high quality) blade over the surface of the skin and the shaving cream provides a very slick, protective, thin layer so the blade is cutting close to the skin but not irritating or injuring the skin.</li>
            <li> I squeeze a little cream into my hand and then evenly rub it on my face.</li>
            <li> However, it is difficult to gauge the water/cream ratio, and it either doesn&#x27;t foam enough or it is too foamy and loose.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little Jack Black Beard Lube and a small amount of water, which thins it out just a bit while maintaining its slickness.</li>
            <li> and it becomes very thin and offers little protection.</li>
            <li> I put a little in my mug with just a tiny bit of water, it doesn&#x27;t lather up real thick but instead expands a little to make a creamy froth.</li>
            <li> I only shave every other day, and I don&#x27;t have a complicated routine that others post.</li>
            <li> Also clogs my razor and is not easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric was consistent, but my face was always the same-pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Heavy tube is hard to squeeze, though, making the last few ounces difficult to dispense.  </li>
            <li> I use very little pressure with the blade and it just glides as if on ice with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Duke&#x27;s is the antithesis of a product like Williams shave bar which has lots of lather but very little protection or slickness at the skin level.</li>
            <li> know some people have trouble lathering this stuff if you have hard water (like I do).</li>
            <li> I got bored of this, and I went back to the sensor, after I found it in a box hiding in the basement.  </li>
            <li> Certainly no better that</li>
            <li> No better than brand name creams.</li>
            <li> I would compare the required amount to at least an almond size.</li>
            <li> The lather will look like it is not as thick as say Proraso but do not fret.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m convinced it deserves a serious</li>
            <li> Not a good value in my experience</li>
            <li> And boy is it bad.</li>
            <li> tastes terrible!!  </li>
            <li> My neck is virtually void of razor rash since getting rid of those terrible multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Turns out this product is meant to be used without a brush.  I&#x27;m a brush man.  Tossed it in the bin.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Billy Jealousy products and very rarely do I stray from their stuff. But I saw Duke Cannon Shaving Cream was rated best shaving cream on About.com and decided to give it a try. Sadly, I am not going back to Billy&#x27;s Hydroplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try a new grooming product I always like to open it up and take a whiff. Well, smelling this was pretty uneventful. It does not come off overly strong smelling, which is good in my opinion. I do not like overly smelly products. The next test is the feel test. I like to rub a bit between my fingers and get a feel for the product. This stuff is so smooth and slippery, I knew it was going to do a good job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few more shaves left in my bottle of Hydroplane, but I had to try this product. I shave in the shower and try to keep it simple. I squeeze a little cream into my hand and then evenly rub it on my face. When I first put this product on my face I was impressed with how far just a little went. I shave with your standard Gillette 800 blade razor and had no issues with clogging. I was very happy with my first Duke shave. It felt like it gave me a closer shave than the Hydroplane and left my skin feeling better. I am pretty skeptical when something seems to be better than a Billy Jealousy product. I decided I needed a better side by side comparison. The next shaving day I decided to do a half and half test. I covered half of my face with Billy&#x27;s Hydroplane and the other half with Duke&#x27;s Shave Cream. The Duke side felt a little more slick while shaving, but the real comparison is how my face feels after. I can&#x27;t say that it was a huge difference between the two halves of my face. But the Duke side was definitely smoother and felt like it was shaved closer. As my facial hair grew back the difference became more pronounced. The Duke side had a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the sensitive side and I had no reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a fan of Duke&#x27;s shaving cream and will be using it. I feel this shaving cream is worth a try if you are in the market.g cream is worth a try if you are in the market.</li>
            <li> I use Duke Cannon with a simple brush.  It lathers quite easily for me in a bowl.  I use just a tiny bit of the product with a few drips of water.  It has lasted me for months, and I shave often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that the shave is any better or worse than using a product like Barbasol, but the smell is much nicer.  Subjectively, my skin feels better when I use a nicer shaving cream.  That could very well be &amp;#34;in my head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> When I was a kid, I learned to shave with a sensor excel, as it was the newest razor out, before we went to 3, 4 or 5 blade &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; for shaving.  I transitioned to an electric razor, because it was &amp;#34;consistent&amp;#34; and I could do it every day, because traditional foam and my sensor left me too irritated to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric was consistent, but my face was always the same-pretty bad.  I got bored of this, and I went back to the sensor, after I found it in a box hiding in the basement.  (bought new blades, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck was destroyed the first few times I shaved.  I started reading up on wet shaving, and learned some new techniques to keep the burn tolerable.  Enter Duke Cannon-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a parker best badger brush for Christmas, and a tube of this stuff.  It took me like 3 shaves to figure out how to use it:&lt;br /&gt;I got a regular old mug, and right after my shower I put the brush in the mug and run the hot water to fill the mug and get the brush good and hot.  I take the brush out, drain the mug, and give one good flick of my wrist to empty the brush of most of the retained water.  I squirt in a nickel sized dollop of Superior Grade, and make up a nice lather.  The whole process takes less than 2 minutes.  I re-wet my face with some warm water, and lather with the brush.  This stuff is completely non-greasy but slick.  I do a &amp;#34;with-the-grain&amp;#34; shave, and then go back for an &amp;#34;against-the grain&amp;#34; shave.  On the against the grain-I wet my hand and reactivate the lather for like 2 seconds before, and I&#x27;ve again got a great slick lather that&#x27;s not too thick to see the remaining hair on my face that needs to be shaved off. I do a warm water wash and then a cold water wash, and then aftershave.&lt;br /&gt; After 3 shaves, NO irritation.  Smooth skin, easy routine.  The lather is easy with the quick one flick of the wrist on the brush.</li>
            <li> There once was a shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;Supposed to be a dream&lt;br /&gt;But it is really only sol sol&lt;br /&gt;Stick to Barbasol.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the shave when I use it, which is most every day. Will keep this in stock at home! My wife keeps smelling me and asking what I have on. I wish they cologne in this.</li>
            <li> Leaves a great smooth shave and leaves my skin moisturized.  I have a very thick beard which grows in quickly so I have to shave frequently.  I have seen a reduction in razor burn as well.</li>
            <li> Does not make as good as lather as the Sutton Old Spice cream I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;Tends to evaporate after only a few minutes</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream. Lathers quickly with minimal effort. Lighter lather but seems to protect the skin very well while shaving. Rinses easily from the the razor or brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave cream.  I just put some on my face and/or onto my brush and then lather up directly on my face.  It works great.  I use a double edge safety razor, but this would work great whatever you shave with.</li>
            <li> Good shave cream but still not the best. I have tried so many brands due to my neck being very sensitive, and I still have not yet found one that works as well as Nancy Boy cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving cream. This is my first venture to a barbershop quality cream that I&#x27;m using on a brush. Definitely much nicer than aerosol creams. Lathers nicely. Razor glides over it ok. Nothing mind blowing but good cream</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve encountered so far. It minimizes my razor bumps and does not have a strong scent. I feel like I have a very clean and close shave when I use it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before choosing this product.  A small amount goes a long way, and it is very &amp;#34;slick,&amp;#34; which gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  I mix it with a little Jack Black Beard Lube and a small amount of water, which thins it out just a bit while maintaining its slickness.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  About 2 years ago I switched from an electric razor to a traditional razor.  I tried almost every cream and gel available.  Most of them left my skin greasy, dried out or chaffed.  I was ready to switch back to the trusty electric when I found Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream. It lathers perfectly, provides a smooth glide for the razor, smells great and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed after the shave. I would never go back to electric and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use another shaving cream.  Top notch stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams and gels, but I continued to look around because I never had that excellent shaving experience. I found out about Duke Cannon when I was looking around online for some other things, so I decided to give this product a shot. The shave cream is rich, and makes for a close shave. I have an issue with in grown hairs, and so far, this product helps to prevent those from happening. From what I can tell, there is no smell to this cream. If there is one, it&#x27;s very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I tried Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I have not used the foams or gels from a can in years.  If I have time and the mood strikes, I will indulge with the brush and lather.  During the week when I need to get out of the door I need something a bit quicker.  I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s shave cream, but gave Duke Cannon a try.  It&#x27;s a slightly thicker cream and I think it does a better job of not only lubricating the face but also standing up the whiskers.  I think this will become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; weekday shave cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but in this case I wanted to clear the air on the negative review about the product being greasy. I strongly disagree. Perhaps if you apply it directly to your face out of the tube, but if you use a shaving brush, it lathers and foams quite nicely. So, don&#x27;t worry about the grease factor if you use a brush to lather as I have found this product to foam and air up more than Proraso, Musgo Real, Truefitt and Hill, Dreadnought (Bluebeards Revenge), or The Art of Shaving. Having said that, I do prefer Truefitt and Hill 1805 over this product as I have found Duke Cannon to foam and air more than I prefer, which I find ironic taking into consideration the poor review about the grease factor.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great shave.</li>
            <li> This product gives a good smooth shave and I like the scent. It also leaves your face soft and conditioned. However, it is difficult to gauge the water/cream ratio, and it either doesn&#x27;t foam enough or it is too foamy and loose.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Now I never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gels for a long time but thought I&#x27;d try something different. I picked up a tube of this with expectations of a good product. It feels like grease and really clogged my razor up and I needed to run a lot of HOT water on the razor to clear the blades. The smell was o.k. and I did get a close shave but I won&#x27;t be using it because of the greasy feeling and the fact that I was spending too much time clearing my razor.</li>
            <li> Made me break out.  Wish I could return it.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I decided to give traditional wet shaving a go.  This was the first creme i purchased along with a merkur 34c razor and parker safety razor synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t get this to lather well at all in a bowl, in my hand or on my face.  It seems to have a decent slickness but it couldn&#x27;t create a nice thick foam no matter how many times i tried.  If i put even slightly too much water, the lather totally loses form and if i don&#x27;t put that much water, the lather does not build up and also dries out on my face before i even get through a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i figured, it&#x27;s either my brush or perhaps the hardness of my water.  After reading that hard water can require larger amounts of creme, i tried doubling the amount of creme to 2 or 3 times the size of an almond.  yes i got more lather, but the quality was still poor and finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing a tub of razorock xxx with tallow, which is an italian soft soap.  On my first use i saw a huge difference in the quality of lather.  The lather built up much easier with a small amount of product and the peaks are much more defined.  The form (peaks) of the lather also remained nice when adding additional water to my brush.  Also, this lather does not dry out on my face before i finish my pass, which is what i consider acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line is that perhaps this creme will work well for you. Perhaps if your water is different than mine and you have a brush that holds exactly the right amount of water for this product, you might get a nice lather as other people appear to have gotten.  That just wasn&#x27;t my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beginners or people who are unwilling to gamble on this product, i would recommend something that is more forgiving to lather such as razorock xxx or proraso green.  I get better mileage from those products and they also happen to be cheaper.</li>
            <li> tastes terrible!!  haha.. i know you are thinking, why did you eat it?  lol.. i didnt.  it just sometimes gets near your lips.  And boy is it bad.</li>
            <li> Takes too much to do a proper job and is too expensive for how much one has to use. Also clogs my razor and is not easy to wash out. Not a good value in my experience and I will not buy it again. I went back to my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of shaving creams. I&#x27;ve finally settled on this one. I&#x27;m going to share with you what I do when I shave with this stuff. This is the same technique I&#x27;ve used all along with other shaving creams and it has served me well. I&#x27;m doing this because I truly believe in this product and I&#x27;m convinced it deserves a serious trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Merkur Mergress D/E razor, Gillette Silver Blue blades, a Parker badger brush, a porcelain wide-mouth mug, and Duke Cannon shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those that shaves before I shower. I first fill the sink with hot water, and drop my mug in it. The mug is not submerged. I fill the mug halfway with hot water and drop my brush in it. I then soak my facecloth in the sink, and apply it to my face for a minute. I don&#x27;t fully wring the cloth so that I properly moisten my face. Put the cloth aside, dump the water from the mug, flick the excess water from the brush just once. The water in your brush will be an appropriate water-to-cream ratio. In your slightly wet mug, squeeze an amount of shaving cream. I would compare the required amount to at least an almond size. Start making a lather in your mug. The lather will look like it is not as thick as say Proraso but do not fret. It is still slick enough for a smooth shave. I believe the lack of thickness is because Duke Cannon has no parabens in its formula. It&#x27;s better for you actually. If you shower before you shave, then exercise some concurrent activity. Soak your brush and mug in hot water while you shower. You will get a nice warm shave and there is nothing more luxurious in the morning. The whole process of shaving takes me 10 - 12 minutes. It is a ritual I continually look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the mug (un-submerged) in the hot water. It will remain warm and so will the lather. I do three passes on my face and neck (north-to-south, east-to-west, and south-to-north). I have enough lather left over to revisit my neck with a J-hook technique as there are always a few little hairs that escaped my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the price, I was able to find it elsewhere for $14 free shipping. If you are complaining that it&#x27;s greasy, then you must be working for the competition. If you feel you cannot properly gauge the amount you need for a good shave, you should try a cream that comes in jar. Guaranteed you&#x27;ll revisit your gripe about figuring out how much you need out of a tube. Besides, I just told you what you need... An almond size. If you feel it clogs your razor, then you should come down in the number of blades you use. You don&#x27;t need half a dozen blades for a comfortable shave. The amount of blades becomes even more significant if you happen to be a yeti. So don&#x27;t blame the cream. If you feel the cream dries quicker on your face compared to other creams, you would be correct. That is because this cream does not have parahydroxybenzoates, a preservative in cosmetics and as stated before, this cream is probably better for you. Solution. Stop fiddle farthing&#x27; around and get the job done before it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for the company. I do not have shares in the company. I do not usually write reviews but I thought this was worth my time because I like the stuff. I have sensitive skin and I have tried many products and different combinations for the best possible shave. Today, my best possible shave includes Duke Cannon shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is amazing. I had been using your basic Gillette shave gel and decided to give this a try based on some reviews I read. I have never had such a close shave as with Duke Cannon cream. I use the same blades (Gillette Sensor) and put this cream on with a shaving brush. I have a very heavy beard, but after shaving with Duke Cannon, my face is as smooth as glass. I use very little pressure with the blade and it just glides as if on ice with no irritation. This stuff is great. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff by searching reviews for the \\&quot;best shaving cream.\\&quot; I checked out their website and decided to give it a try. I was blown away by my first shave. I put a little in my mug with just a tiny bit of water, it doesn&#x27;t lather up real thick but instead expands a little to make a creamy froth. The shave itself was smooth and my safety razor had no problem with it, though I could see that a standard razor might have trouble with it. After, I didn&#x27;t even need aftershave balm or lotion and my face felt great for the rest of the day. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now and it&#x27;s amazing. Provides excellent lubrication and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s . . . . OK. Smells good, you get a decent shave.  Certainly no better that Cremo Cream, which is half the price.  Heavy tube is hard to squeeze, though, making the last few ounces difficult to dispense.  Threw it out wondering how much was left in it.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> TLDR; Best shaving cream I have used yet. It lasts a long time, smells great, gives you a crazy good shave and is worth every penny. I can&#x27;t shut up about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shaving cream for over a year and love it. This stuff makes for the most comfortable shave I have ever had in my life. It has excellent lubricity, smells great (not overpowering) and leaves my skin feeling excellent and clean.I use a single blade Merkur and have an okay sliver-tip badger brush and when paired with Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream and a drop or two of shaving oil, the shave cannot be beat as far as comfort and closeness. My neck is virtually void of razor rash since getting rid of those terrible multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have trouble lathering this stuff if you have hard water (like I do). I use a shaving bowl, shaving brush and I have zero issues. If I want a little more lather, I just dip the edge of my brush in the water and this stuff lathers up again and again while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Dreadnought shaving cream recently because I heard it was good stuff. Within a week I went back to Duke Cannon. This shaving cream is superior in every way.</li>
            <li> Get a great shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for a few years and tried Duke cannon five or six times before writing this. Most reviews have only great things to say about duke cannon. I could not get this product to lather well or consistently. Experimenting with it I have found that the amount of water used with the product matters. Slightly too much water and it becomes very thin and offers little protection. Smaller amounts and is performs better. Obviously too much water with any product compromises performance but with Duke Cannon there seems to be little room for error where others have wider tolerances. When it is right is fairly slick. The scent is mild which I also prefer. There are, in my opinion many products in this price range that outperform duke cannon mainly because they are more consistent offer better protection.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. No better than brand name creams.</li>
            <li> The reviews are all over the map, and I&#x27;ll add one for the top-tier. This is an outstanding product. I only shave every other day, and I don&#x27;t have a complicated routine that others post. I shower, rewet my face, squeeze out a dollop, and lather with my hands. That&#x27;s all it takes. It feels good, it smells good, and it&#x27;s loaded with moisturizer so I don&#x27;t need after-shave. A tube will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with this product because the Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club is only available with a blade subscription. Both the Shave Butter and the Duke worked great for me, but I&#x27;m not in the market for blades. My routine is simple, and Kroger stocks all the disposable single-blade shavers I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty creating a lather with this shaving cream.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be the best out there, but it is far from the worst.</li>
            <li> I saw a list of the best shave creams. The list was compiled by a writer, former barber. All were &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; products. Duke&#x27;s was rated #1. I have converted to wet shaving with the badger brush, mug and even now use a DE safety razor. The right shaving cream is just as important in wet shaving as the right blade. Duke&#x27;s is the antithesis of a product like Williams shave bar which has lots of lather but very little protection or slickness at the skin level. Gillette Foamy especially or even Barbasol has thick foam which looks great like whipped cream but very little slickness, protection at the level of the skin. If you are using a 5 blade cartridge like Gillette Fusion or Harry&#x27;s blades you can use almost any shaving cream and &amp;#34;get by&amp;#34;, i.e. fairly comfortable and no cuts. But, if you are using a DE blade (personally I think the best are Kai blades from Japan) you need a much better cream. When you apply Duke&#x27;s it looks almost like the froth off a cappuccino and you assume it could not possibly protect. Like I said how much foam is sticking out from your face and how much &amp;#34;peaking&amp;#34; of the foam when you lather in the mug doesn&#x27;t matter. The proof is in what&#x27;s happening right at the surface of the face. In shaving with a DE blade you are VERY lightly drawing a very sharp (in Kai blades case very high quality) blade over the surface of the skin and the shaving cream provides a very slick, protective, thin layer so the blade is cutting close to the skin but not irritating or injuring the skin. Duke Cannon Shaving Cream does this. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t look thick; yes, it may evaporate or not last until the end of your shave in places so you have to apply some more (no big deal, with the almond size amount you put in the mug it makes plenty to reapply if needed).  In short, this is a great product. Get a mug and a badger brush and even if you are using the 5 blade standard razors this will give you a better shave. If you are using a DE blade this quality of shave cream is an imperative.  I realize everyone&#x27;s beard, routine and experience may be different but this is my experience.</li>
