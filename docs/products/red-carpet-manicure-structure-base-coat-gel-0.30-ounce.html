            <li>I think has the best quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li>It also looks great on its own, as it appears to whiten the nails and make them look healthier and shinier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I just put the RCM top coat over it and it looks great with no color.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Works great with UV light.</li>
            <li>Nice bondage.</li>
            <li>This product has been the best so far!</li>
            <li>Four stars because it&#x27;s amazing to be able to do gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly too!</li>
            <li>I now have much better nails.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and it cures better than almost all of the others that i have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Overall very good product</li>
            <li>Any gel colors I apply over this come off just fine</li>
            <li>I also used a Peggy Sage primer and lightly file my nails.</li>
            <li>We have tried others but Red Carpets structure, and brilliance are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I have also never experienced peeling with the Sally Hansen brand (which doesn&#x27;t have the greatest reviews).  </li>
            <li>I have been happy with the gel colors from RCM, so I was pretty surprised that the structure gel was such a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my top choice for a gel manicure, but it&#x27;ll work as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We LOVE Red Carpet</li>
            <li>My nails were damaged, peeling and brittle and some of them were really falling apart.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the whole thing peels off after two days.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want too much or it will harden on your cuticle or skin once you cure your nails with the uv/led lamp.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a much stronger wattage lamp from Amazon and now I never have that problem.</li>
            <li>and  helps them grow long and strong without wearing off or peeling off.  </li>
            <li>It is true that this comes on extremely thick and despite my best efforts to thin it out, it doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I have a high end UV lamp, too.</li>
            <li>The damaged ones,  except for two of them, have completely healed and I can tell they are much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has really made my nails last past one week.  </li>
            <li>However, I found that sometimes the gel would not set, which was a huge waste of time.</li>
            <li>Even when applied as thin as possible, I experienced peeling after only a week, even though I used pH bond.  </li>
            <li>in was big enough to hold a standard size hardcover book and was stuffed full of air-filled packing pillows.</li>
            <li>Red Carpet base coat is the best.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of a splurge, this is a good one and you wont be sorry you did it!</li>

            <li> you apply this product as your base always take off any excess from the brush and apply to the nail you sometimes don&#x27;t have to dip the brush back in and can apply to a second nail.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with some of the negative reviews here. I had some nail damage due to overfiling (my fault entirely).  My nails were damaged, peeling and brittle and some of them were really falling apart. I used Red Carpet Manicure structure gel with nail forms to BUILD a nail. It&#x27;s that tough. It protected my nails while they were growing out and drastically improved their condition.  I now have much better nails.  The damaged ones,  except for two of them, have completely healed and I can tell they are much healthier and stronger. This product binds together damaged nails and  helps them grow long and strong without wearing off or peeling off.  It also looks great on its own, as it appears to whiten the nails and make them look healthier and shinier.  I just put the RCM top coat over it and it looks great with no color.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gelish base coat and my polish was chipping the next day. With Red Carpet base and Ph Bond, my polished lasted a week and a half. Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the other bottles to complete the gel nail manicure. It is true that this comes on extremely thick and despite my best efforts to thin it out, it doesn&#x27;t work either. I also used a Peggy Sage primer and lightly file my nails. I have a high end UV lamp, too. I was very careful in application several times and the max the manicure will last is 1 week. Sometimes, the whole thing peels off after two days. Very disappointed in this product. I sugges RCM works to improve this formula.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my top choice for a gel manicure, but it&#x27;ll work as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator brush could be a bit longer for easier, smoother brushstrokes ensuring even coverage.  Also, my manicure doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long with Red Carpet as it does with Gelish or FingerPaints, but again, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for about a year and a half and it cures better than almost all of the others that i have tried.</li>
            <li> This structure can actually be used to build a nail..It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Nice bondage. I&#x27;ve used a different polish with this Red Carpet base coat and the Red Carpet top coat. After a week it wanted to chip but I think it was the polish because I&#x27;ve used Gelish polish with this and it&#x27;s still on and it&#x27;s going on three weeks.</li>
            <li> Red Carpet base coat is the best.  We have tried others but Red Carpets structure, and brilliance are by far the best.  We may use different brands in the colors sometimes but Red Carpet I think has the best quality.  I think it works and stays on longer than OPI even.  We LOVE Red Carpet</li>
            <li> This product is so thick that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get an EVEN thin coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about this product is I do not consider it a base coat.  It&#x27;s so shiny and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; texture that my other gel basecoats have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting this stuff off is tough.  Any gel colors I apply over this come off just fine but then I end up rewrapping my nails in foil because not all of the gel basecoat comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Carpet Gel Base Coat is not at all what I was looking for as far as a base goes.  I will stick with Sally Hansen or Finger Paints basecoats from now on.</li>
            <li> Works great with UV light.</li>
            <li> This gel is supposed to be applied in a very thin layer in order to cure properly, but the texture of the gel is extremely thick.  Even when applied as thin as possible, I experienced peeling after only a week, even though I used pH bond.  I was previously using Sally Hansen base/topcoat for LED gel curing systems, and it is easier to apply and cures in half the time (plus it works as a base AND topcoat, so I don&#x27;t have to spend another $10 on a topcoat).  I have also never experienced peeling with the Sally Hansen brand (which doesn&#x27;t have the greatest reviews).  I expected RCM structure gel to be a lot better, and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  I have been happy with the gel colors from RCM, so I was pretty surprised that the structure gel was such a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR:  Structure gel is not worth the money; it&#x27;s hard to apply, takes a long time to cure, and peels after a week.</li>
            <li> I bought the Red Carpet Manicure kit and needed a refill of the base coat. I am not sure if you can buy this in stores. Maybe at Sally&#x27;s. I rather have it shipped to my door!</li>
            <li> As with all Red Carpet nail products this is a quality base.  I can&#x27;t stress enough though that it must be applied in a thin coat.  It is rather thick so it goes a long way.  Wipe both sides of the brush on the inside of the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this set, the Gel Polish stays on her nails over 2 weeks, but the tips get a little worn off.</li>
            <li> This product has been the best so far! I love it and it has really made my nails last past one week.  When I get my nails done at salons they use other products that make my gel polish crack within 3 days so even though this polish is thick it is well worth it! I have had my nails last over a week and a half close to two weeks... Usually I&#x27;m the one taking it off before my nails chip because I want to try another color...&lt;br /&gt;When you apply this product as your base always take off any excess from the brush and apply to the nail you sometimes don&#x27;t have to dip the brush back in and can apply to a second nail. You don&#x27;t want too much or it will harden on your cuticle or skin once you cure your nails with the uv/led lamp.  Overall very good product and I love it! I will rebuy!</li>
            <li> Four stars because it&#x27;s amazing to be able to do gel nails at home. However, I found that sometimes the gel would not set, which was a huge waste of time. I figured out that the lamp that comes with the kit is pretty weak. I ordered a much stronger wattage lamp from Amazon and now I never have that problem. Another tip is to line your fingers with Vaseline so you don&#x27;t paint onto your skin. If you do this, the gel will lift at the edges</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing!! Came very quickly too!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of gel base coat, and none have been as good as this.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Works as well as Gelish but less expensive. The 2 stars are for Amazon&#x27;s packaging. The box the bottle comes in os 1&amp;#34;x1&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;. The box it was *shipped* in was big enough to hold a standard size hardcover book and was stuffed full of air-filled packing pillows. They shipped me a lot of air and cardboard along with an itty bitty bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! At home gel can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I&#x27;ve tried several including gelish. This is my go to brand!</li>
            <li> Red Carpet Manicure Gel Polish is all I use. If you are thinking of a splurge, this is a good one and you wont be sorry you did it!</li>
