            <li>It has a great smell and you can truly feel the clean.  </li>

            <li>Now it is a very light floral scent, but it is a floral scent.</li>
            <li>l love all palmer products.</li>
            <li>Omg I love this.</li>
            <li>Better than the loreal exfoliating one with the scrub</li>
            <li>I bought this along time ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more than one of theses if I cant find this in babies</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast, I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I love it and love all palmers products</li>
            <li>and my skin seems to be looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>I Love Palmer&#x27;s products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased, my husband and children are ecstatic, and my bank account is happier too.</li>
            <li>love love love.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>my face looks and feels softer and more moist; and NO irritation.</li>
            <li>LOVE the cocoa beans :) they feel so smooth to the skin</li>
            <li>Works great in my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>its great softer skin and exfoiates good and fades dark spots on face.evens</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s always makes a good product, but this face scrub is too &#x27;gentle&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>It is a little rougher than most in the stores, but I feel it is the best!</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily, and there is no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>face feels so soft, the coco beads are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Kinda creamy feeling, light scrub thingies.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my face is glowing and smooth as a result.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily with my Clarisonic cleaner and have great results</li>
            <li>and I can clean it out of the brush easily.</li>
            <li>will never purchase this product again and I will never recommend it to anyone - unless they enjoy playing 52-pick-up with cocoa bean shards all over their body, as well as bathroom sink and floor.</li>
            <li>this is great for daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The scrub is amazing, the skin is so soft and fresh afterwards!!</li>
            <li>If your looking for something quick great price and something that will get the job done without doing a 5-20 minute facial mask every day or night, this is what you want to get.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh feeing!</li>
            <li>I also found an exfoliating facial scrub that is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I sometimes don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer afterward because it just leaves my face feeling buffed, clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like most of Palmer&#x27;s products; however, this wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to wash my face first before using it, because my face doesn&#x27;t feel very clean after use.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and the microbeads really feel like they&#x27;re getting rid of all the dirt from my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a red head with VERY fair and VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>I used this all during the week and it kept my face very refreshed, and very clean.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at the local Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for awhile</li>
            <li>love the smell of this stuff - that&#x27;s my main reason for using it.</li>
            <li>after years of using many different facial scrubs, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has a fresh lily scent.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it again as there are better  exfoliating facial scrubs available.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>right on there</li>
            <li>only problem I foresee for people is the very strong fragrance this stuff has.</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general.</li>
            <li>These also can&#x27;t be good for going down your bathroom sink drain</li>
            <li>Feel like it doesn&#x27;t get the job done well enough to reveal the super smooth, new and fresh skin that I enjoy after using an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I used to be only able to find it in Mexico.</li>
            <li>I use all Palmer facial products and love them.  </li>
            <li>The facial scrub is my favorite</li>
            <li>After I used this for the first time, I was amazed by how soft and smooth my face felt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since my skin responds well to exfoliating, I try and use it every day and have had no ill effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>Sorry Palmer&#x27;s this is not one of your best products.</li>
            <li>product gives the skin a softer and more moistened feeling than the apricot scrub mentioned above.</li>
            <li>A good product to use every few days while using a gentler foam wash the rest of the week.</li>
            <li>Although some reviews have mentioned that the grit is too much for their skin, I find it to be just right.  </li>
            <li>At least the scent was pleasant and it did leave my face clean, soft, and blemish</li>
            <li>as a mild scrub for sensitive skin it works well.</li>
            <li>This product is a great exfoliating face wash,  not great for dry skin to use more than once a day.</li>
            <li>although I would be careful if you decide to use it more than that.  </li>
            <li>After trying many many facial scrubs, FINALLY something for brownskin girls that actually work.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen that much difference in using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it that much though</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s how much</li>
            <li>can really tell this is a scrub.  </li>
            <li>My skin starts to feel rough about 3-4 days after using any exfoliant, so i needed something I could use more often.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>The only scrub I have used that I like better, is one made by a major cosmetic company at about three times the cost of this one.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing particles are ground to a very fine texture, but occasionally I find a bigger &#x27;chunk&#x27;.</li>
            <li>i would have rated this as 5 star if it didn&#x27;t smell funny, it&#x27;s like old gramma clay smell.  </li>
            <li>Just gage it based on your particular skin.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still feeling fresh and smooth, I would wait a few days to prevent</li>
            <li>Will update comments after using it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>B. you skin is very soft after....</li>
            <li>This was my first Facial product from Palmer&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My skin is not super sensitive, so it was okay using this, but only about once a week.  </li>
            <li>Everything from Aveeno to certain Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotions have irritated my skin, sometimes to the point of seeking medical attention.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend to anyone looking for a daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You apply it to your face and massage it in circular motions to clear up your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice a week,</li>
            <li>I was surprised others said they didn&#x27;t like the smell of it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My doctor visits are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received within a few days and securely packaged.  </li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re not overly rough to the point where they damage the fresh skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>After I massage it on my face, my skin feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t leave a musky smell like other scrubs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a cheapo face wash where you can barely feel any exfoliation happening. .</li>
            <li>I use many of their skin care products and have never had a bad reaction, which is more that I can say for some of the other brands I have tried (at any price).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dry.</li>
            <li>Especially if you keep the dome bare.  </li>
            <li>but your skin gets very soft and feels moisturized not dried out and stiff feeling after washing</li>

            <li> However, they&#x27;re not overly rough to the point where they damage the fresh skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> After I massage it on my face, my skin feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t leave a musky smell like other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheapo face wash where you can barely feel any exfoliation happening. .</li>
            <li> I use many of their skin care products and have never had a bad reaction, which is more that I can say for some of the other brands I have tried (at any price).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dry.</li>
            <li> Especially if you keep the dome bare.  </li>
            <li> but your skin gets very soft and feels moisturized not dried out and stiff feeling after washing</li>
            <li> The scrub smells strange and the beads are too big and feel like I&#x27;m scratching my face.</li>
            <li> Just hate that in order to get a good price you have to order at least $35 worth of stuff to get it as an ADD-ON item.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have very sensitive skin, but I have not had any reactions.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sticking with this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The micro crushed cocoa beans are very very tiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they need the added fragrance, but it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used other products of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and it has suited me a lot that&#x27;s why I decided to Use the Exfoliating Facial Scrub.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase the other items in this facial product line.</li>
            <li> My face in particular is hard to find a cleanser for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should be marketed toward people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t dry u out and won&#x27;t over moisture..</li>
            <li> I started taking medication for acne which has made my sink really dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having to use a facial scrub twice a day everyday, but now I only use it once every morning.</li>
            <li> This product and all others Ive tried smells completely different and not worth using.</li>
            <li> The beads are tough enough to wipe away dead skin cells, leftover makeup residue, and the daily grime buildup that comes along with a busy lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> But since you are to use minimal pressure when scrubbing your face, that has not been a problem.</li>
            <li> My blemishes and rough spots went away after 1 week of using this product.</li>
            <li> However, the grains were a bit rough for my taste, so I didn&#x27;t get another tube after finishing this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and use this every other day and it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> The pieces of cocoa feel a little rough</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day and have only one negative comment about it.</li>
            <li> They are a little large and sharp, it makes it a little uncomfortable to rub around.</li>
            <li> I am a black women and it worked every well on my face.</li>
            <li> It claims to have micro cocoa beans when in reality you might as well be covering your face in a mask of half ground coffee beans.</li>
            <li> I end up dabbing some on each cheek, on my forehead, a little on my chin, and a little on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed improvement to my skin after a few washes.</li>
            <li> and I use all palmers product everyday</li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 weeks ago and have seen no changes, also this scrub has a very odd smell that may not appeal to everybody.</li>
            <li> my skin tone try today.it affordable to and does the same as expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s is a brand that I usually praise</li>
            <li> One can usually depend on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart before but cant find it in any lately.</li>
            <li> This is a serious exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is an absolute necessity to keep myself from going insane.  </li>
            <li> Kinda like flowers mixed with nasty.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> Ive been disappointed with all the Palmer products except the small tub of cocoa butter (cream?).</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin, so my skin tends to flake quite easily (awful, I know).  </li>
            <li> but this product was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the product, reminds me of a tire store</li>
            <li> The cocoa bean shards are simply annoying and go up your nose, into your eyes (OW!), get stuck in your hair...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a serious exfoliator.  A good product to use every few days while using a gentler foam wash the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I used to be only able to find it in Mexico. My daughter no longer lives there, so, thank you for carrying it! Cleans good, smells good and rinses off easily!</li>
            <li> I use all Palmer facial products and love them.  They leave my skin very clean and soft.  The facial scrub is my favorite</li>
            <li> l love all palmer products.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works great in my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one makes my skin soft.  I recommend using the entire line of Palmers facial products.</li>
            <li> Not liking the smell but does seem to work well.  Beads are not overly abrasive but do the job.  Will probably not order again because just not liking that smell.  Kinda like flowers mixed with nasty.</li>
            <li> Should be marketed toward people with dry skin. Kinda creamy feeling, light scrub thingies. Made my skin feel weird. I gave this product away.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin, so my skin tends to flake quite easily (awful, I know).  Moisturizer is an absolute necessity to keep myself from going insane.  By the end of the week, my face is definitely in need of exfoliation to wipe everything away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a blessing.  The beads are tough enough to wipe away dead skin cells, leftover makeup residue, and the daily grime buildup that comes along with a busy lifestyle.  However, they&#x27;re not overly rough to the point where they damage the fresh skin underneath.  After I used this for the first time, I was amazed by how soft and smooth my face felt.  It&#x27;s the same result every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply it to your face and massage it in circular motions to clear up your face.  I always wash my face before beginning.  I end up dabbing some on each cheek, on my forehead, a little on my chin, and a little on my nose.  It&#x27;s quick and easy!  It rinses off easily, and there is no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice a week, although I would be careful if you decide to use it more than that.  Just gage it based on your particular skin.  If you&#x27;re still feeling fresh and smooth, I would wait a few days to prevent irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  No itching, no rashes, no overdrying.  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Palmer&#x27;s products, and this is another winner in my opinion!</li>
            <li> After trying many many facial scrubs, FINALLY something for brownskin girls that actually work.I also found an exfoliating facial scrub that is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great smell but I haven&#x27;t seen that much difference in using it. I haven&#x27;t been using it that much though so that&#x27;s probably why. The face lotion(fade cream)works wonders.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this. Better than the loreal exfoliating one with the scrub brush(the one that&#x27;s orange). I bought this along time ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores anymore. I used this all during the week and it kept my face very refreshed, and very clean. I am a black women and it worked every well on my face. If your looking for something quick great price and something that will get the job done without doing a 5-20 minute facial mask every day or night, this is what you want to get. I will be buying more than one of theses if I cant find this in babies r us or target. I bought this from Walmart before but cant find it in any lately.</li>
            <li> face feels so soft, the coco beads are perfect for sensitive skin. I always get a nice glow after using this. I also noticed improvement to my skin after a few washes.</li>
            <li> my dem dr said I should not use it cause it may cause skin damage.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this at the local Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for awhile so I decided to order it online (that&#x27;s how much I like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this stuff - that&#x27;s my main reason for using it. I was surprised others said they didn&#x27;t like the smell of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has exfoliants that are different shapes and sizes to give your face a textured exfoliant wash. I sometimes don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer afterward because it just leaves my face feeling buffed, clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around - good product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and the microbeads really feel like they&#x27;re getting rid of all the dirt from my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It has a great smell and you can truly feel the clean.  This was my first Facial product from Palmer&#x27;s and I am now hooked (I use their entire line including daily cleaner and nighttime cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really tell this is a scrub.  It is a little rougher than most in the stores, but I feel it is the best!</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day and have only one negative comment about it. The scrubbing particles are ground to a very fine texture, but occasionally I find a bigger &#x27;chunk&#x27;. But since you are to use minimal pressure when scrubbing your face, that has not been a problem. The only scrub I have used that I like better, is one made by a major cosmetic company at about three times the cost of this one. So I&#x27;m sticking with this as long as they make it. By the way, it does not say to use it daily, but says you &#x27;can.&#x27; Since my skin responds well to exfoliating, I try and use it every day and have had no ill effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My blemishes and rough spots went away after 1 week of using this product. Additionally, my face is glowing and smooth as a result.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth, soft and clean. The pieces of cocoa feel a little rough but when u rinse your face feels wonderfully moisturized.</li>
            <li> The scrub is amazing, the skin is so soft and fresh afterwards!! The shipment was fast, I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s always makes a good product, but this face scrub is too &#x27;gentle&#x27;. Feel like it doesn&#x27;t get the job done well enough to reveal the super smooth, new and fresh skin that I enjoy after using an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love it and love all palmers products and I not received I product that I did not like and I use all palmers product everyday</li>
            <li> Very nice exfoliate. I can feel it scrubbing away the dirt off my face. However, I have to wash my face first before using it, because my face doesn&#x27;t feel very clean after use. So a three star will do.</li>
            <li> I like Palmer&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ve used them for over 20 years. I get compliments on my skin all the time, people often think I&#x27;m younger than my actual age and I attribute that to taking good care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT smell like cocoa butter, I wish it did. Instead, it has a fresh lily scent. Now it is a very light floral scent, but it is a floral scent. Those of you who don&#x27;t like those flowery scents right on there face may not want to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;The micro crushed cocoa beans are very very tiny. I use this product daily with my Clarisonic cleaner and have great results and I can clean it out of the brush easily.</li>
            <li> LOVE the cocoa beans :) they feel so smooth to the skin and it really works! will buy again! also, it moisturizes the skin properly.</li>
            <li> u can literally smell the coco beans !! This is awesome for skin of color !! Won&#x27;t dry u out and won&#x27;t over moisture.. Clean fresh feeing!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have very sensitive skin, but I have not had any reactions. My face is feeling and looking smoother and more youthful (yeah!) after using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula exfoliating facial scrub. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and use this every other day and it has improved my skin. I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> This product is a great exfoliating face wash,  not great for dry skin to use more than once a day. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I like most of Palmer&#x27;s products; however, this wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.  I would not buy it again as there are better  exfoliating facial scrubs available.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been amazing. I&#x27;m used to having to use a facial scrub twice a day everyday, but now I only use it once every morning. The beads are big, but they don&#x27;t scratch or leave skin feeling irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I foresee for people is the very strong fragrance this stuff has. I don&#x27;t know why they need the added fragrance, but it lingers for a long time. I&#x27;m almost done with the tube and I&#x27;m still not used to the smell yet. I don&#x27;t have a fragrance allergy, but if you do you might want to look into something else.</li>
            <li> I started taking medication for acne which has made my sink really dry. I have used other products of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and it has suited me a lot that&#x27;s why I decided to Use the Exfoliating Facial Scrub. It&#x27;s only been three weeks and my skin seems to be looking and feeling better. Will update comments after using it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I Love Palmer&#x27;s products, but not this one. The scrub smells strange and the beads are too big and feel like I&#x27;m scratching my face. Sorry Palmer&#x27;s this is not one of your best products.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general. I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i would have rated this as 5 star if it didn&#x27;t smell funny, it&#x27;s like old gramma clay smell.  but your skin gets very soft and feels moisturized not dried out and stiff feeling after washing :) i still use it every few days despite the smell and would probably continue purchasing because of 2 reasons: A. at least it&#x27;s not chemical smell, B. you skin is very soft after....</li>
            <li> as a mild scrub for sensitive skin it works well. I hate the smell of the product, reminds me of a tire store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a red head with VERY fair and VERY sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Everything from Aveeno to certain Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotions have irritated my skin, sometimes to the point of seeking medical attention. My face in particular is hard to find a cleanser for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since I&#x27;ve switched to the Palmer&#x27;s products I have seen a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s not dry. It&#x27;s not red. It&#x27;s not rough. I&#x27;m pleased, my husband and children are ecstatic, and my bank account is happier too. My doctor visits are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmer&#x27;s has changed my life!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done.  Skin feels smoother after using it.  However, the grains were a bit rough for my taste, so I didn&#x27;t get another tube after finishing this one. My skin is not super sensitive, so it was okay using this, but only about once a week.  My skin starts to feel rough about 3-4 days after using any exfoliant, so i needed something I could use more often.</li>
            <li> Lover facial scrub, have purchased several times and well purchase again.</li>
            <li> love love love. exfoliates without drying smells good, the beads are crushed coco beans so they feel great and r good for the environment instead of those microbeads.</li>
            <li> Ive been disappointed with all the Palmer products except the small tub of cocoa butter (cream?). That stuff smells amazing even if its a bit greasy. This product and all others Ive tried smells completely different and not worth using.</li>
            <li> its great softer skin and exfoiates good and fades dark spots on face.evens my skin tone try today.it affordable to and does the same as expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> After I massage it on my face, my skin feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t leave a musky smell like other scrubs.  Definitely get this product because it works.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s is a brand that I usually praise but this product was very disappointing. It claims to have micro cocoa beans when in reality you might as well be covering your face in a mask of half ground coffee beans. The cocoa bean shards are simply annoying and go up your nose, into your eyes (OW!), get stuck in your hair... These also can&#x27;t be good for going down your bathroom sink drain I would imagine. At least the scent was pleasant and it did leave my face clean, soft, and blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase this product again and I will never recommend it to anyone - unless they enjoy playing 52-pick-up with cocoa bean shards all over their body, as well as bathroom sink and floor.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days and securely packaged.  My doctor suggest a face scrub and I chose to try this one.  It works really well and I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy St Ives Apricot scrub...yes men need exfoliating occasionally too!  Especially if you keep the dome bare.  Anyway, I tried to find the product at Walgreeens, CVS, Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Publix to no avail.  One can usually depend on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This product gives the skin a softer and more moistened feeling than the apricot scrub mentioned above.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> this is great for daily exfoliation. I plan to purchase the other items in this facial product line. I certainly recommend to anyone looking for a daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> after years of using many different facial scrubs, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 weeks ago and have seen no changes, also this scrub has a very odd smell that may not appeal to everybody.</li>
            <li> The only exfoliator I use. Love it.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Exfoliating Facial Scrub, 5.25 Ounce:&lt;br /&gt;I like Palmer&#x27;s products. To my knowledge, they do not test on animals or use ingredients derived from animals. I use many of their skin care products and have never had a bad reaction, which is more that I can say for some of the other brands I have tried (at any price). After using this facial scrub 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks my face looks and feels softer and more moist; and NO irritation.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it. Just hate that in order to get a good price you have to order at least $35 worth of stuff to get it as an ADD-ON item.</li>
            <li> I like the scrub except for the granules/scrubbers in the cleansers. They are a little large and sharp, it makes it a little uncomfortable to rub around.</li>
            <li> Although some reviews have mentioned that the grit is too much for their skin, I find it to be just right.  You can definitely feel the exfoliant mixed in with the cleansing agent, so be prepared.  This isn&#x27;t a cheapo face wash where you can barely feel any exfoliation happening. . Nice, cocoa scent as well.</li>
