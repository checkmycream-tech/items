            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>It was one of his favorites and happy he could find it again.</li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND HAS USED IT BEFORE AND LIKED THE SOOTHING FEELING ON HIS FACE.  </li>
            <li>Liked the Saxon Woodspice much better but can&#x27;t find it anymore</li>
            <li>Love this on my husband.</li>
            <li>I did not like the Musk fragrance I like the Woodspice much better.</li>
            <li>My spouse has been using Saxon Golden Musk for years and it is a nice fragrance that I am not allergic to</li>
            <li>Got it here fast and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>The old scent was one of the nice things in my life, and others liked it a lot, too.</li>
            <li>Very mild sweet scent, no hint of any musk scent which i dislike anyway.</li>
            <li>and I receive it fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old Golden Musk that I used almost non-stop for 30+ years,</li>
            <li>The musk scent is very nice, not overbearing like a lot of fragrances used in other products.</li>
            <li>This Saxon Golden Musk Aftershave Cream makes shaving on sensitive skin so much more of a pleasure than a chore.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Fans of the old Saxon may want to try all-natural Men&#x27;s Stock &amp;#34;Spice Island&amp;#34; by Aubrey Organics, found in many whole food / organics type stores.</li>
            <li>Most of my female friends , noticed it right away..</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;change it back &amp;#34; , they say.. ;~}  I may order more..</li>
            <li>, so we always go back for more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was a problem at the seller&#x27;s end or one that occurred in shipping, but it did detract from a totally positive review.</li>
            <li>The new golden musk formula is just too flowery and fruity smelling for my taste and</li>
            <li>They have changed the formula and the fragrance, which used to be a pleasantly mild, masculine and woodsy spice scent, that refreshed the face and soothed after shaving.</li>
            <li>This is not the old Saxon Golden Musk.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>I did order  Musk because they did not have Woodspice what which I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I have been using Saxon Golden Musk for nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li>We both really like it</li>
            <li>I have been using the original formula Saxon for almost 30 years, but then it disappeared from stores, only to be found online now.</li>
            <li>New scent is OK, but not worth anywhere near the $30</li>
            <li>No mention on the container that this is a new version.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy the new product again.</li>
            <li>Woodspice has not been available in a long long time</li>
            <li>This new version comes in the exact same bottle as the old, yet is totally different.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy 10 bottles at a time -- enough to last him the whole year</li>
            <li>Last year I found it on-line several places for $11 a bottle -- which I thought was high.  </li>
            <li>I still have a few drops left in my last old bottle, so I know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>

            <li> as close to the what I used to get 30 years ago.  Very mild sweet scent, no hint of any musk scent which i dislike anyway.</li>

            <li> This is not the old Saxon Golden Musk.  I did read other reviews other than those here, so I knew this was the case.  I liked the old Golden Musk that I used almost non-stop for 30+ years, so much so that I took a chance.  This new version comes in the exact same bottle as the old, yet is totally different.  I don&#x27;t think it is musk at.  Isn&#x27;t this fraud?  No mention on the container that this is a new version.  New scent is OK, but not worth anywhere near the $30 or so I spent to get it. I still have a few drops left in my last old bottle, so I know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  The old scent was one of the nice things in my life, and others liked it a lot, too.</li>

            <li> Love this on my husband. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> I ordered four bottles as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my husband.  One of the bottles leaked during shipment.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a problem at the seller&#x27;s end or one that occurred in shipping, but it did detract from a totally positive review.</li>
            <li> Not the same wood spice Saxon from years gone by. I have been using the original formula Saxon for almost 30 years, but then it disappeared from stores, only to be found online now. CVS used to carry it with the shaving supplies. They have changed the formula and the fragrance, which used to be a pleasantly mild, masculine and woodsy spice scent, that refreshed the face and soothed after shaving. The new golden musk formula is just too flowery and fruity smelling for my taste and my wife&#x27;s too. It&#x27;s got to pass the &amp;#34;wife test&amp;#34;, right? It&#x27;s also less viscous (thick/creamy) and seems watery and thin. It&#x27;s also crazy expensive now. What the heck happened over there at Saxon? This falls solidly into the category of why did they &amp;#34;fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34;?!? I won&#x27;t buy the new product again. Fans of the old Saxon may want to try all-natural Men&#x27;s Stock &amp;#34;Spice Island&amp;#34; by Aubrey Organics, found in many whole food / organics type stores.</li>
            <li> I did order  Musk because they did not have Woodspice what which I really wanted. I did not like the Musk fragrance I like the Woodspice much better. Woodspice has not been available in a long long time</li>
            <li> Not the fragrance I was looking for.  Couldn&#x27;t find woodspice listed but do not know why.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED IT BEFORE AND LIKED THE SOOTHING FEELING ON HIS FACE.  i LIKE THE AROMA WHEN HE USES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I order this for my FIL, because he can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Got it here fast and in good shape.  I have been using Saxon Golden Musk for nearly 20 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t consider using any other!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. We both really like it</li>
            <li> Liked the Saxon Woodspice much better but can&#x27;t find it anymore</li>
            <li> The product itself is a 5 star.  This product is one that my husband has used for a long time.  In the past several years, I have had problems finding it.  I used to find it in drug stores and even Walmarts.  Last year I found it on-line several places for $11 a bottle -- which I thought was high.  Little did I know I would have to pay $22.99 EACH this year.  Cost-wise -- a 1 star! I used to buy 10 bottles at a time -- enough to last him the whole year (he used it every day.  He likes the soothing feel to his face after shaving and feels it protects his face from getting dry or chapped..  This year he only got 3.</li>
