            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING quality and besides calling it a Len wig when it&#x27;s a Rin wig..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I promise all Rin cosplayers you will never find a wig this cheap with free shipping and is excellent quality.</li>
            <li>well liked.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and seller is very nice!</li>
            <li>but the hairs fall out as easily as my own (very easily).</li>
            <li>THe wig is of good quality and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and the color is perfect for the character I&#x27;m cosplaying (Rin Kagamine).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and super</li>
            <li>it makes it look very smooth :)</li>
            <li>this is such a great wig!!</li>
            <li>I was a bit weary about this wig being so cheap, but it&#x27;s become one of my favorites to wear, and it gets a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li>but over all i love it.</li>
            <li>The color was definitely a bit darker than in the picture, but its perfect for my Rin cosplay! ^^</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this wig and I am glad i bought it</li>
            <li>i love it to death.</li>
            <li>i also love the color blending in it</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more orange/yellow than in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t stretch to hold onto the head better as I&#x27;m used to and</li>
            <li>Does she love vocaloid?</li>
            <li>i love the wig and the quality, but it has ends that stick up so its not what it says it is</li>
            <li>she had one more</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>I recommend getting this wig :-)</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But it just lovely.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great wigs, I am totally satisfied with every one!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig the quality is amazing and the exact color as in the picture.</li>
            <li>came in early and in great shape~&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It is perfect for her Kagamine Rin cosplay and it arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much shorter than pictured, but still  a good wig</li>
            <li>For the price, very worth it :)</li>
            <li>Other then that, it was an awesome wig!</li>
            <li>All the other wigs from this seller are supercheap, no shipping, and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>But other than that its a wonderful wig!</li>
            <li>Other then that perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of the best quality, it looks authentic and the ends are already styled which saves me the trouble of styling them.</li>
            <li>but once you do its easy to work with.</li>
            <li>but  it was  easy to fix.</li>
            <li>i love the wig but when i first got it was really wavy on the bottom but after straightening it look really good</li>
            <li>This wig is very nice and super soft.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fantastic wig nevertheless</li>
            <li>And for only $9.36?!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing my mom ordered it today i cant wait it will be my First true wig :D</li>
            <li>It really really likes to curl in or out and has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>This wig is really cheaply made...</li>
            <li>the hair began to fall out as soon as I opened the package, and it didn&#x27;t even fit my head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and the color is accurate.</li>
            <li>The product arrived securely and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>The wig is great and just a warning it is flippy in the back.</li>
            <li>Its not the correct color, I was going to use this for Rin on Vocaloid, but it was more of a golden color for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>longer than expected, but good fit!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, you can&#x27;t see through it and the hair holds very nicely.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  </li>
            <li>It was soft and a nice color and came fairly quick.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t specify which part of the wig was the front and it kind of liked to shed a little bit so the fibers caught on to my clothes a bit.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is generally to my liking, but putting the wig ON is kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li>the wig itself is soft and smooth, and although it&#x27;s much shorter than expected the color is perfect!</li>
            <li>Your latest review has just gone live on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the wig is SUPER durable and worth its money.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>worth the money~â™¡</li>
            <li>came right on time (about a month after ordering it) and wasn&#x27;t messed or tangled from shipping.</li>
            <li>Color was right, came with two wig caps which is convenient.</li>
            <li>not bad, doesnt tangle really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute and adorable but it feels tight.</li>
            <li>i love this wig its nice and thick and no hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>soft and easy to take care</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a more yellow colour!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like in the picture</li>
            <li>Passed as my real hair!</li>
            <li>I got this wig for my sister and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was for my younger cousin, and it did fit her head.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this wig before and was expecting good quality, so I ordered it again for a different cosplay, but I got the opposite!</li>
            <li>But good enough to use for simple cosplay.</li>
            <li>Vow~ Rin cosplay and was hoping it&#x27;d look a little more like the picture (although I am fully aware that it will never look exactly like the picture).</li>
            <li>I have never seen such an amazing wig and I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li>The stocking cap was a much appreciated bonus.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really have no clue which vocaloid this goes to or who she cosplays.</li>
            <li>It fits REALLY well</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy and you should buy your own wig cap.</li>
            <li>it sucks good quality but doesnt look like rins hair.</li>
            <li>Good quality, thick wig.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>rather hard to part because of seams but other wise YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I absolutely love the wig.</li>
            <li>I love this but the white wig net keeps showing</li>
            <li>Very soft, like real hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My mom thought it was my actual hair at first!</li>
            <li>Its a very good wig there are some parts of it where i&#x27;m afraid it may come apart</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to find the part, but that is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>In the picture the top one is the one I bought a few months ago and</li>
            <li>As someone who mostly buys from Epic Cosplay Wigs, I was unsure if I should order this for a Kagamine Rin cosplay at such a low price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my big head very well, and kind of lumps up in a weird spot.</li>
            <li>It was a lot darker, and extremely thin, but for what your paying, it&#x27;s pretty good for a simple Rin cosplay!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality!</li>
            <li>It is very cute but the quality is very low for the price, the hair falls down on the touch, and dosen&#x60;t have enough hair to cover gaps</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble keeping the bangs out of my face, but a headband or bobby pin could easily fix that.</li>
            <li>this wig is okay, but kind of annoying to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my Daughter of Evil cosplay :)</li>
            <li>All I know is this wig was needed to complete her cosplay.</li>
            <li>for one thing, the wig hair falls out way faster and in larger quantities than a normal wig should.</li>
            <li>the only reason I had to dock a star was because it really was much shorter than expected and barely fits on my head.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I&#x27;m not sure if the haircut is very accurate of Kagamine Rin because of the many layers, and it&#x27;s slightly itchy compared to the wigs I usually wear.</li>
            <li>But for the overall quality of the wig, it&#x27;s soft to the touch</li>
            <li>It barely sheds unless you pull on the ends..</li>
            <li>The one I received today is thin and the netting is showing through on the top.</li>
            <li>a little bit thin and sheds a bit but its good for the low price</li>
            <li>Really thick and full.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this for my little sister since she really wanted to cosplay with me</li>
            <li>thing bad about it is that it&#x27;s hard to find the part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome wig!</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s a fantastic wig nevertheless</li>
            <li> And for only $9.36?!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing my mom ordered it today i cant wait it will be my First true wig :D</li>
            <li> It really really likes to curl in or out and has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> This wig is really cheaply made...</li>
            <li> the hair began to fall out as soon as I opened the package, and it didn&#x27;t even fit my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and the color is accurate.</li>
            <li> The product arrived securely and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> The wig is great and just a warning it is flippy in the back.</li>
            <li> Its not the correct color, I was going to use this for Rin on Vocaloid, but it was more of a golden color for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> longer than expected, but good fit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, you can&#x27;t see through it and the hair holds very nicely.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  </li>
            <li> It was soft and a nice color and came fairly quick.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t specify which part of the wig was the front and it kind of liked to shed a little bit so the fibers caught on to my clothes a bit.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is generally to my liking, but putting the wig ON is kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li> the wig itself is soft and smooth, and although it&#x27;s much shorter than expected the color is perfect!</li>
            <li> Your latest review has just gone live on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the wig is SUPER durable and worth its money.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> worth the money~â™¡</li>
            <li> came right on time (about a month after ordering it) and wasn&#x27;t messed or tangled from shipping.</li>
            <li> Color was right, came with two wig caps which is convenient.</li>
            <li> not bad, doesnt tangle really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and adorable but it feels tight.</li>
            <li> i love this wig its nice and thick and no hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> soft and easy to take care</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a more yellow colour!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like in the picture</li>
            <li> Passed as my real hair!</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my sister and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Luckily, it was for my younger cousin, and it did fit her head.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this wig before and was expecting good quality, so I ordered it again for a different cosplay, but I got the opposite!</li>
            <li> But good enough to use for simple cosplay.</li>
            <li> Vow~ Rin cosplay and was hoping it&#x27;d look a little more like the picture (although I am fully aware that it will never look exactly like the picture).</li>
            <li> I have never seen such an amazing wig and I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> The stocking cap was a much appreciated bonus.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really have no clue which vocaloid this goes to or who she cosplays.</li>
            <li> It fits REALLY well</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy and you should buy your own wig cap.</li>
            <li> it sucks good quality but doesnt look like rins hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality, thick wig.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> rather hard to part because of seams but other wise YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I absolutely love the wig.</li>
            <li> I love this but the white wig net keeps showing</li>
            <li> Very soft, like real hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My mom thought it was my actual hair at first!</li>
            <li> Its a very good wig there are some parts of it where i&#x27;m afraid it may come apart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to find the part, but that is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> In the picture the top one is the one I bought a few months ago and</li>
            <li> As someone who mostly buys from Epic Cosplay Wigs, I was unsure if I should order this for a Kagamine Rin cosplay at such a low price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my big head very well, and kind of lumps up in a weird spot.</li>
            <li> It was a lot darker, and extremely thin, but for what your paying, it&#x27;s pretty good for a simple Rin cosplay!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality!</li>
            <li> It is very cute but the quality is very low for the price, the hair falls down on the touch, and dosen&#x60;t have enough hair to cover gaps</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble keeping the bangs out of my face, but a headband or bobby pin could easily fix that.</li>
            <li> this wig is okay, but kind of annoying to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my Daughter of Evil cosplay :)</li>
            <li> All I know is this wig was needed to complete her cosplay.</li>
            <li> for one thing, the wig hair falls out way faster and in larger quantities than a normal wig should.</li>
            <li> the only reason I had to dock a star was because it really was much shorter than expected and barely fits on my head.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I&#x27;m not sure if the haircut is very accurate of Kagamine Rin because of the many layers, and it&#x27;s slightly itchy compared to the wigs I usually wear.</li>
            <li> But for the overall quality of the wig, it&#x27;s soft to the touch</li>
            <li> It barely sheds unless you pull on the ends..</li>
            <li> The one I received today is thin and the netting is showing through on the top.</li>
            <li> a little bit thin and sheds a bit but its good for the low price</li>
            <li> Really thick and full.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this for my little sister since she really wanted to cosplay with me</li>
            <li> thing bad about it is that it&#x27;s hard to find the part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome wig!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the part at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just too small for my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same color as shown, and it does tangle a little bit, but they can easily be brushed out with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of other ones in different colors and styles from this seller.  </li>
            <li> Second, it was a lot longer than the picture, going down to my shoulders, but a bit of trimming and styling will make it look just like her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told this is a big deal, so I just go along with it jumping up and down squeeing in glee...</li>
            <li> Lastly, its really hot, itchy, and uncomfortable to wear for longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> First off it had a bit of a green tint to it (not that bad, which happens even in real life to people when usuing blonde hair dye).</li>
            <li> The wig arrived around the day it was expected so it was on time and is neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> Product came as showed on picture minus the hair band.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good wig, i barley got it and its falling apart, its way to short, just looks like a Meiko wig dyed blond, and it doesn&#x27;t come with the bow</li>
            <li> Also, the bangs are way heavier than the back of the wig so its hard to clip them to the side.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the color being too yellow and too shiny, but the hair and color looks natural.</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll admit that when we looked at this picture, it appeared as if the wig would be shoulder length, but It was a little shorter than that.</li>
            <li> It was a little shorter than i wanted</li>
            <li> It was a little shorter than I wanted</li>
            <li> In the picture it was a light blonde, but when I received it, it was a nasty color of mustard yellow/orange-yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I may cut it to fix a few things.</li>
            <li> but I might be combing it too harshly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not having too much trouble..</li>
            <li> After Roxy became desperate for a new wig I chopped this one up into Dirk Strider.</li>
            <li> but the cap is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Alluring Secret ~Black</li>
            <li> The hair is rEALLY HARD TO CONTROL.</li>
            <li> A bit thin in some areas aswell.</li>
            <li> The quality is still seriously disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Alluring Secret ~Black Vow~ Rin cosplay and was hoping it&#x27;d look a little more like the picture (although I am fully aware that it will never look exactly like the picture). First off it had a bit of a green tint to it (not that bad, which happens even in real life to people when usuing blonde hair dye). Second, it was a lot longer than the picture, going down to my shoulders, but a bit of trimming and styling will make it look just like her. But for the overall quality of the wig, it&#x27;s soft to the touch but the hairs fall out as easily as my own (very easily). I will still use it. I don&#x27;t regret buying it~!</li>
            <li> this is such a great wig!! came right on time (about a month after ordering it) and wasn&#x27;t messed or tangled from shipping. the wig itself is soft and smooth, and although it&#x27;s much shorter than expected the color is perfect! the only reason I had to dock a star was because it really was much shorter than expected and barely fits on my head.</li>
            <li> My elder sister brought this for my for my birthday and I&#x27;ll admit that when we looked at this picture, it appeared as if the wig would be shoulder length, but It was a little shorter than that. I&#x27;m not complaining though, it&#x27;s a fantastic wig nevertheless and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and adorable but it feels tight. I get a headache everytime I wear it..</li>
            <li> I was a bit weary about this wig being so cheap, but it&#x27;s become one of my favorites to wear, and it gets a lot of compliments! It&#x27;s about the same color as shown, and it does tangle a little bit, but they can easily be brushed out with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this wig before and was expecting good quality, so I ordered it again for a different cosplay, but I got the opposite! The one I received today is thin and the netting is showing through on the top. It&#x27;s also a more yellow colour! In the picture the top one is the one I bought a few months ago and the one on the bottom is the one I just got.</li>
            <li> As someone who mostly buys from Epic Cosplay Wigs, I was unsure if I should order this for a Kagamine Rin cosplay at such a low price. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality! It&#x27;s very soft! I was afraid of the color being too yellow and too shiny, but the hair and color looks natural. The only thing is I&#x27;m not sure if the haircut is very accurate of Kagamine Rin because of the many layers, and it&#x27;s slightly itchy compared to the wigs I usually wear. The cut and style don&#x27;t look like the stock photo used. The haircut thins out at the end, and it&#x27;s already styled to flip out. I may cut it to fix a few things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and super soft!&lt;br /&gt;It also comed with a wig cap and it is adjustable</li>
            <li> Much shorter than pictured, but still  a good wig none the less. The color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I used this wig for a Rin Kagamine and a Roxy Lalonde cosplay and i loved it! the only problem was the thickness so you have to work with it a bit but over all i love it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, thick wig.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing bad about it is that it&#x27;s hard to find the part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome wig! Great color, and it actually came a bit longer than the picture. Awesome! :D</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it. Very soft, like real hair.</li>
            <li> Really loved the wig! It was soft and a nice color and came fairly quick. It looks exactly like in the picture but the cap is a bit small. Other then that, it was an awesome wig!</li>
            <li> Great quality but the package came ripped</li>
            <li> this wig is okay, but kind of annoying to wear. for one thing, the wig hair falls out way faster and in larger quantities than a normal wig should. Also, the bangs are way heavier than the back of the wig so its hard to clip them to the side. Lastly, its really hot, itchy, and uncomfortable to wear for longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice and super soft.  The color was definitely a bit darker than in the picture, but its perfect for my Rin cosplay! ^^ i love it.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived around the day it was expected so it was on time and is neatly packaged. I absolutely love this wig the quality is amazing and the exact color as in the picture. It was a little shorter than i wanted but it still pulled of the cosplay I was using it for and for the price its being sold for makes this a awesome deal. I really love this wig and I am glad i bought it</li>
            <li> I Can not wait to Get this! Mine is suppose to come january 4 2014 - JANUARY 28 2014 So i heard its good :D And for only $9.36?!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing my mom ordered it today i cant wait it will be my First true wig :D So please tell me if its good :D</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing. It&#x27;s of the best quality, it looks authentic and the ends are already styled which saves me the trouble of styling them. It&#x27;s kind of hard to find the part, but that is not a problem at all. I have never seen such an amazing wig and I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> the wig is SUPER durable and worth its money. i love it to death. perfect for cosplaying. only problem is the part..... rather hard to part because of seams but other wise YOU SHOULD BUY IT!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> i love this wig its nice and thick and no hairs fall out. i also love the color blending in it it makes it look very smooth :)</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this for my little sister since she really wanted to cosplay with me and I just recently bought a Megurine Luka wig.&lt;br /&gt;she used this wig to cosplay as Rin Kagamine.&lt;br /&gt;it came in early and in great shape~&lt;br /&gt;Very soft and easy to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;so worth the money~â™¡</li>
            <li> Really nice! Passed as my real hair! It&#x27;s perfect for my rin cosplay!</li>
            <li> This wig will be perfect for any Kagamine Rin cosplay! Fast shipping and seller is very nice! Glad I got it from this seller! &amp;#60;3  It&#x27;s great for my Daughter of Evil cosplay :)</li>
            <li> not bad, doesnt tangle really. a little bit thin and sheds a bit but its good for the low price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more orange/yellow than in the picture. The hair is rEALLY HARD TO CONTROL. It really really likes to curl in or out and has a mind of its own. I ended up turning it into a Kida Masaomi wig (because it just happened to be the perfect length for that)</li>
            <li> I like the wig, it was just a bit shorter then I thought it would be. Other than that, I absolutely love the wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is really cheaply made... the hair began to fall out as soon as I opened the package, and it didn&#x27;t even fit my head. Luckily, it was for my younger cousin, and it did fit her head. The quality is still seriously disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not a very good wig, i barley got it and its falling apart, its way to short, just looks like a Meiko wig dyed blond, and it doesn&#x27;t come with the bow</li>
            <li> In the picture it was a light blonde, but when I received it, it was a nasty color of mustard yellow/orange-yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and handling was easy and perfect, and came at the correct time.&lt;br /&gt;However, the picture wasn&#x27;t even close to the color of the actual wig I received.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble keeping the bangs out of my face, but a headband or bobby pin could easily fix that. My mom thought it was my actual hair at first! It&#x27;s smooth and the color is accurate. I strongly suggest getting this!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, you can&#x27;t see through it and the hair holds very nicely. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived securely and neatly packaged. The description of this great product was aptly appropriate. The stocking cap was a much appreciated bonus.</li>
            <li> It was a lot darker, and extremely thin, but for what your paying, it&#x27;s pretty good for a simple Rin cosplay!</li>
            <li> Its a rins wig not a len wig XD anyway its very nice but a prob is that hair keeps falling of the wig</li>
            <li> The wig is great and just a warning it is flippy in the back. I used it for roxy cosplay and all I did was trim the bangs. Also pictures with flash wont turn out so well.</li>
            <li> Great and comfortable wig, sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed everywhere at the slightest touch.</li>
            <li> I love this but the white wig net keeps showing so I have to find out how to fix that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t fit my big head very well, and kind of lumps up in a weird spot. But maybe I just got a dud, I don&#x27;t know...It&#x27;s really just too small for my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig. Sometimes the hair falls out a bit but I might be combing it too harshly. The cut is good but I don&#x27;t really recommend it. A bit thin in some areas aswell. But good enough to use for simple cosplay.</li>
            <li> Its not the correct color, I was going to use this for Rin on Vocaloid, but it was more of a golden color for me.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is generally to my liking, but putting the wig ON is kind of a hassle. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve only bought a handful of wigs prior but this doesn&#x27;t stretch to hold onto the head better as I&#x27;m used to and it feels like I&#x27;m wrestling it just to put it on over my wig cap.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  I bought a bunch of other ones in different colors and styles from this seller.  Super fast shipping and great wigs, I am totally satisfied with every one!</li>
            <li> Do you have a daughter that loves to cosplay? Does she love vocaloid? Then this would be a perfect buy. I really have no clue which vocaloid this goes to or who she cosplays. All I know is this wig was needed to complete her cosplay. I bought it and you would have thought I had just given her the keys to the a Veyron. I&#x27;m told this is a big deal, so I just go along with it jumping up and down squeeing in glee...</li>
            <li> Came in a week sooner than I thought which is really good. However, it didn&#x27;t specify which part of the wig was the front and it kind of liked to shed a little bit so the fibers caught on to my clothes a bit. Color was right, came with two wig caps which is convenient. For the price, very worth it :)</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing~! It fits REALLY well and I love the adjustable straps! It&#x27;s perfect for my cosplay and parting-wise.. I&#x27;m not having too much trouble..It&#x27;s AMAZING quality and besides calling it a Len wig when it&#x27;s a Rin wig.. It&#x27;s perfect! Good length.. great quality..and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We ordered several wigs at once, and this one is the only one that has held up well at all.</li>
            <li> Using it for a chica cosplay from FNAF and it worksperfectly</li>
            <li> i love the wig and the quality, but it has ends that stick up so its not what it says it is</li>
            <li> Out of all the wigs I&#x27;ve gotten, this one is the best. I promise all Rin cosplayers you will never find a wig this cheap with free shipping and is excellent quality. All the other wigs from this seller are supercheap, no shipping, and excellent quality.Get it now before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful RIN WIG! my daughter is creating her RIN cosplay for ComicCon and the wig was the final peice needed! THe wig is of good quality and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Your latest review has just gone live on Amazon. We and millions of shoppers on Amazon appreciate the time you took to write about your experience with this item. This the second item she got she had one more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wig for Rin and Roxy Lalonde. After Roxy became desperate for a new wig I chopped this one up into Dirk Strider. It&#x27;s a really good wig and it looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li> I knew this was Kagamine Rin&#x27;s hair from the image.  Product came as showed on picture minus the hair band.  Good wig for the price</li>
            <li> Love love love it, it&#x27;s amazing. I cosplay as rin all the time</li>
            <li> this was a gift. well liked.</li>
            <li> The wig came two days before the set time which was great! It&#x27;s incredibly soft and the color is perfect for the character I&#x27;m cosplaying (Rin Kagamine). It was a little shorter than I wanted but it still looks great! It&#x27;s hard to find the part at first but once you do its easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It is very cute but the quality is very low for the price, the hair falls down on the touch, and dosen&#x60;t have enough hair to cover gaps</li>
            <li> I received this wig on July 22 and it&#x27;s been 4 months now and I still have the wig! It in great condition. It barely sheds unless you pull on the ends.. Other than that, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! I use  it for a Roxy Lalonde, Rin Kagamine, and a Chica from Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s cosplay. I recommend getting this wig :-)</li>
            <li> Ordered this wig for a convention and a week or so after the order was processed it arrived. Perfectly styled and clean, no need for touch ups, even after the shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my sister and she absolutely loves it! It is perfect for her Kagamine Rin cosplay and it arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great for a Rin Kagamine cosplay! It is a bit heavy and you should buy your own wig cap. You will need to brush it often just so it wont tangle. But other than that its a wonderful wig!</li>
            <li> Wig is lovely! Really thick and full. It&#x27;s really great especially considering the price. I use it for Rin and Roxy Lalonde but it works good for others characters too.</li>
            <li> longer than expected, but good fit!</li>
            <li> it sucks good quality but doesnt look like rins hair.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It is not a Rin wig but it is a great wig for Roxy Lalonde. If your looking for a Rin wig this is not the one but it is a great wig and I love it.</li>
            <li> Just to tell people it doesnt come with the bow. But it just lovely. I bought it for my friend and i to cosplay together she is going to be rin and im gonna be len!</li>
            <li> Its a very good wig there are some parts of it where i&#x27;m afraid it may come apart but  it was  easy to fix.Other then that perfect.</li>
            <li> i love the wig but when i first got it was really wavy on the bottom but after straightening it look really good</li>
