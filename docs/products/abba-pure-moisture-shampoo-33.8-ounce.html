            <li>Greatest shampoo ever for dry hair and scalp!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have been using this shampoo for 20+ years.  </li>
            <li>It is fine though.</li>
            <li>This product works great in conjunction with the conditioner of the same name.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair was in big need of some help and was amaze how great these products worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it online and at the same price I was paying before.</li>

            <li>Used this shampoo for many years really like it</li>
            <li>If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone.</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I ended up with the new product for more money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos (including all-naturals) in my day and while my hair may feel and smell good, I&#x27;ve found that 95% of them leave my scalp dry and itchy, even with conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Good for dry and color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to throw away the bottle after the first use!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and detangled and healthy.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner somehow searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here.</li>
            <li>When I found Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo on sale at Harmon, I was excited because of the rave reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this.</li>
            <li>Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow</li>
            <li>Works with balance when also utilizing ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love it so much because of its moisturizing and natural.</li>
            <li>and I really like how it&#x27;s gentle but gets the hair clean.</li>
            <li>I have the thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, and it has been about 4 months.</li>
            <li>The real product is luxurious and smells of fresh mint.</li>
            <li>My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; when I flat iron!).</li>
            <li>In just one use my dry curly hair has become soft, frizz free and a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li>ABBA products are getting harder to find and this is the easiest and most economical way to get their products.  </li>
            <li>I really feel how much softer my hair is, after just first use</li>

            <li>[[ASIN:B000ZHEAMM ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner 6.76 oz.]]</li>
            <li>It was replaced by this Pure Moisture shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use this product along with ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I try a lot of sulfate-free shampoos, since I need to protect my red color-treated fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really moisturized the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very moisturizing with out making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and though the bottle itself is identical to the real product, that is where the familiarity ends.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very moisturizing and luxurious</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much but still cleans and leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li>You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you&#x27;re not rich.</li>
            <li>It shipped from New York to Arizona.  </li>
            <li>My mistake, but I thought this was the new Moisture Sensation line.</li>
            <li>note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo.</li>
            <li>Small bottles cost more and have to but them once a month.</li>
            <li>I prefer to only wash my hair one time, but with this shampoo, I have to wash with another shampoo first, then this one.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought it from the salon I frequent, but since the cost was a little out of my league, I searched for the shampoo online and found it here at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>really great for dry, thin hair.</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I guess that was too far for the cap to hold up and stay shut.</li>
            <li>and just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.</li>
            <li>I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying and trying out for dry frizzy hair that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li>Abba made a new line of shampoo and it does not have the same ingredients this is why I ordered it through Amazon</li>
            <li>I have alot of hair, but it is fine, and it is hard to find a hair product that keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft after using only a week.  </li>
            <li>I do not like it quite as much; but still prefer it to any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is only a little less potent.</li>
            <li>I love it for my thin dry hair.</li>

            <li> I prefer to only wash my hair one time, but with this shampoo, I have to wash with another shampoo first, then this one.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought it from the salon I frequent, but since the cost was a little out of my league, I searched for the shampoo online and found it here at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> really great for dry, thin hair.</li>
            <li> and this makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I guess that was too far for the cap to hold up and stay shut.</li>
            <li> and just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.</li>
            <li> I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying and trying out for dry frizzy hair that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Abba made a new line of shampoo and it does not have the same ingredients this is why I ordered it through Amazon</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair, but it is fine, and it is hard to find a hair product that keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft after using only a week.  </li>
            <li> I do not like it quite as much; but still prefer it to any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is only a little less potent.</li>
            <li> I love it for my thin dry hair.</li>
            <li> I also dont want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair</li>
            <li> Only a small dab suds up my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Not making any accusations, as I&#x27;m not sure where the breakdown took place, but this is NOT Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair got really dry and my scalp was itchy dry, especially in Colorado winter time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time but could no longer get it.  </li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair, this is the shampoo for you!  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was dry and not very manageable.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon it at a Walgreen&#x27;s when I lived in Colorado a few years back.</li>
            <li> When I see women with dried up hair, especially because of all the chemicals they&#x27;ve put in their hair..</li>
            <li> It is thin, very minty, -gone is the almond scent-</li>
            <li> Just a few washes in other brands of shampoos, itchy comes back.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but I ordered the wrong shampoo; I normally buy Abba Moisture Scentsation Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, coarse and curly hair that is hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> I can tell the lid is not the same as in the usual bottle as well.</li>
            <li> They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Abba-Moisture-Scentsation-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/</li>
            <li> Not the same formula that I have had in the past that had sage in it.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and only wash once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few years now.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I used another shampoo after this, and it left my hair dull and weak.</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter size amount in my palm, but because this shampoo has no sulfates included, I usually need to wash it twice to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> : I bought two, thinking they were the small size.  </li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of product even though my hair is just past chin length.  </li>
            <li> It cleans without stripping, which I find is very few shampoos succeed at.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling really soft, almost like I just conditioned, whereas a lot of sulfate free shampoos leave my hair feeling terrible and desperate for a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , I have thick course, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The problem is that the shampoo is EXTREMELY thick, and does not lather well.  </li>
            <li> but it just not working for me. :(</li>
            <li> Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell was so horrible</li>
            <li> It is watery and smells horrible.</li>
            <li> This product smells like a horrible chemical attempt to smell like mint.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The new formula doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the original but it still does a wonderful job, making hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a place to buy this. Small bottles cost more and have to but them once a month. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, coarse and curly hair that is hard to manage.  This shampoo is able to moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t strip the oils from my tresses and succeeds in taming those unruly locks of mine.  I use about a quarter size amount in my palm, but because this shampoo has no sulfates included, I usually need to wash it twice to get the desired results. This product was recommended by my hair stylist. I initially bought it from the salon I frequent, but since the cost was a little out of my league, I searched for the shampoo online and found it here at a much more reasonable price.  I think anyone who struggles with hair like mine could benefit from using Abba&#x27;s Moisture Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ABBA shampoo before and I really like how it&#x27;s gentle but gets the hair clean. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few years now. I stumbled upon it at a Walgreen&#x27;s when I lived in Colorado a few years back. My hair got really dry and my scalp was itchy dry, especially in Colorado winter time. Here comes Abba to the rescue! This shampoo really moisturized the hair and scalp. Just a few washes in other brands of shampoos, itchy comes back. This is a very nice moisturizer. I have the thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this is great. Get the conditioner too, it&#x27;s awesome. The mint in it is awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and only wash once or twice a week. I can feel it moisturize as soon as I put it on my hair. It smells great too! I do wish it came with a pump though.</li>
            <li> Yuk, yuk, yuk!  The smell was so horrible I had to throw away the bottle after the first use!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is simply amazing. In just one use my dry curly hair has become soft, frizz free and a lot more manageable. Totally worth buying and trying out for dry frizzy hair that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos (including all-naturals) in my day and while my hair may feel and smell good, I&#x27;ve found that 95% of them leave my scalp dry and itchy, even with conditioning.  I came across this shampoo in a salon/ salon supply store and bought both the shampoo and conditioner and have found it to be the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  With no sodium laurel/laureth sulfate, yucca, germanium, wild mint and 100% vegan, it give my hair great body a nice tingle to my scalp that prompted me to buy this online when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store where I originally purchased it.[[ASIN:B001E0W5RG Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo 8.45oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a moisturizing conditioner too, that a wonderful compliment to the shampoo. [[ASIN:B000ZHEAMM ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner 6.76 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but I ordered the wrong shampoo; I normally buy Abba Moisture Scentsation Shampoo.  xxx</li>
            <li> have used this and their conditoner for yars. I love it for my thin dry hair. It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Abba products for several years.  I always used the Scentsation Shampoo.  It was replaced by this Pure Moisture shampoo.  I do not like it quite as much; but still prefer it to any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful, I have thick course, wavy hair and this makes my hair soft and manageable.  Received the product quickly.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Works well on my deep curly hair. Makes the hair soft and smells great! I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Abba Moisture Shampoo has a pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;I am not allergic to this product. It works well for me. Many do not.</li>
            <li> great shampoo. really great for dry, thin hair. I have alot of hair, but it is fine, and it is hard to find a hair product that keeps my hair moisturized. love this shampoo, but it will burn your eyes. tingles when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I used another shampoo after this, and it left my hair dull and weak. this shampoo is the best!</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes my hair feel moisturized.  Only a small dab suds up my whole head.  Problem was bottle was leaking when I got it.  It shipped from New York to Arizona.  I guess that was too far for the cap to hold up and stay shut.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that leaves hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels good and smells good.  Leaves hair feeling soft and detangled and healthy. Works well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I found Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo on sale at Harmon, I was excited because of the rave reviews here on Amazon. However, the only thing I like about it is the yummy peppermint scent. My hair is Type 4, and it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo at a spa I go to, and loved it.  It cleans without stripping, which I find is very few shampoos succeed at.</li>
            <li> My scalp is even more irritated, I wanted to very much to like it because of the ingredients and the smell is very nice but it just not working for me. :(</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very moisturizing with out making my hair feel greasy. So far it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo ever for dry hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> I have been using Abba for years I still continue to love it I am happy with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product addict. Price doesnt matter to me, Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion. My fave hair serum is $5. My fave face cream is $200. I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer. But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this. I also dont want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner somehow searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here. My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; when I flat iron!). Soemtimes I dont even use the serum, and its still great.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!!  I took a chance and ordered it because I was looking for a substitute for the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner.  The minty smell is great and is very refreshing in the am.  My husband and children are even using this because they love the smell.  My hair is shiny and soft after using only a week.  Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Found this product just as good as salon one, and at a lower price. Also purchased abba conditioner and it was just as good.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the item on the picture and the description of the item is not the same of what I received. Abba made a new line of shampoo and it does not have the same ingredients this is why I ordered it through Amazon but I ended up with the new product for more money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and recommend it to anyone who cares about their hair. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo five stars. I think everyone would love this product. Try it you will love this product.</li>
            <li> This product works great in conjunction with the conditioner of the same name.  It has a minty quality to it.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.  If you like mint, then this product is a good buy.  I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, and it has been about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Not making any accusations, as I&#x27;m not sure where the breakdown took place, but this is NOT Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo. The bottle is the same, the lid is different, the texture is different, the smell is different. It is watery and smells horrible. The real product is luxurious and smells of fresh mint. This product smells like a horrible chemical attempt to smell like mint. I can tell the lid is not the same as in the usual bottle as well. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and though the bottle itself is identical to the real product, that is where the familiarity ends.</li>
            <li> Great smelling mint scent. Makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you&#x27;re not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Abba-Moisture-Scentsation-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B001DAUKG0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361383065&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;abba+mint+scentsation+shampoo</li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair, this is the shampoo for you!  I love the smell too.... try the conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo... I can&#x27;t find it locally, so it&#x27;s awesome that I can get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Years ago, my hair had been permed and colored so much that my hair was dead.  My dear salon owner, Christy Weeks, In St. Augustine, recommended Abba moisture shampoo.  It worked!  And I have continued using Abba, even though the only source at this time seems to be Amazon.com.  Thanks Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Note: I bought two, thinking they were the small size.  I&#x27;m 79.  I don&#x27;t need 67.6 ounces.  How do I return one unopened bottle?</li>
            <li> Great shampoo i ever had! I love it so much because of its moisturizing and natural. Really good for my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have relaxed hair - it&#x27;s probably great for any type of hair.  I am especially happy that I found the very large size to purchase.  I saved a lot of money.  I will continue to use Abba products going forward.  My hair consistently looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Good for dry and color treated hair.  Hair looks and feels better.  I use this product along with ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have been using this shampoo for 20+ years.  When I see women with dried up hair, especially because of all the chemicals they&#x27;ve put in their hair..I wish I had the courage to tell them how they would benefit from this shampoo and Abba&#x27;s moisture conditioner!</li>
            <li> I try a lot of sulfate-free shampoos, since I need to protect my red color-treated fine hair.  This leaves my hair feeling really soft, almost like I just conditioned, whereas a lot of sulfate free shampoos leave my hair feeling terrible and desperate for a conditioner.  The problem is that the shampoo is EXTREMELY thick, and does not lather well.  I have to use a lot of product even though my hair is just past chin length.  I prefer to only wash my hair one time, but with this shampoo, I have to wash with another shampoo first, then this one.  If you don&#x27;t mind the lack of lather, then I&#x27;d recommend this, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  If like me you prefer a lather, I&#x27;d suggest Pureology Hydrate Shampoo, which is also sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic shampoo it&#x27;s very moisturizing and luxurious</li>
            <li> I really feel how much softer my hair is, after just first use</li>
            <li> Not the same formula that I have had in the past that had sage in it. It is the one that I really like, it was perfect for my hair.  Miss the sage. It is fine though.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just what my scalp needed!  I have many allergies to shampoos and soaps, etc....This was recommended by my stylist and it works!</li>
            <li> Works with balance when also utilizing ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair was in big need of some help and was amaze how great these products worked for me.  My hair finally feels like silk and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Used this shampoo for many years really like it</li>
            <li> Good Product! Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> ABBA products are getting harder to find and this is the easiest and most economical way to get their products.  My scalp and hair hair always feel better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time but could no longer get it.  I was happy to find it online and at the same price I was paying before.</li>
            <li> My mistake, but I thought this was the new Moisture Sensation line. It is thin, very minty, -gone is the almond scent- and just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft. Will try Bed Head when I run out of this.</li>
            <li> I used this for years. Got it at the hairdresser. They stopped selling it. I HAD to find it somewhere. I noticed my hair was dry and not very manageable. It is PH balanced and I am soooo happy to find it at such a good price. My hair is happy and I am happy. I bought 2 and they will last me close to a year. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell.  It arrived in 2 days. It doesn&#x27;t lather much but still cleans and leaves my hair very soft</li>
