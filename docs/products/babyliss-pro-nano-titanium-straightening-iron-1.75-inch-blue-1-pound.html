            <li> - my only complaint is that the temperature settings are too high for the iron itself and the silver plating is popping off...</li>
            <li> I have long, curly(frizzy) hair which I&#x27;d been wearing in a bun for the past month or so</li>
            <li> It has cut my time in half that it takes me to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> cuts my straightening time in half</li>
            <li> The highest temperature it reaches is 450 and is the one I use on my thick, long hair without damage or burns.</li>
            <li> this gives out in a few years, I will order again.</li>
            <li> i have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I returned it was a fake, had bubbles in the plates and had sharp ridges that pulled my hair.</li>
            <li> Im serious about Babyliss</li>
            <li> The iron matetial bad</li>
            <li> because I hate the time-consuming hassle of straightening after every wash.</li>
            <li> Ladies, Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
