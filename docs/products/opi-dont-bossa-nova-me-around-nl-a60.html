            <li>I thought it was, but it goes on nicely and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a very unique polish.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, classy, elegant.</li>
            <li>This color was more of a light mauve shade than nude.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s a great look for the entire year if you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>I ordered with free shipping and it still came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>Love love this classic looking color!</li>
            <li>Light pinkish</li>
            <li>Great product, especially when using two coats.</li>
            <li>the polish went on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I have light- medium skin.</li>
            <li>lol - disregard the kind of messy paint job.</li>
            <li>It looks like the picture must have some shiny top coat on because I am looking at my nails right now</li>
            <li>the color is exactly as pictured!!</li>
            <li>Awesome everyday color!</li>
            <li>It will greatly compliment any skin color from light to dark.</li>
            <li>OPI nail colors and gels are great; however gel in DON&#x27;T BOSSA NOVA ME is brighter pink than it looks here, not for me.</li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t chip so quickly.</li>
            <li>They are well worth trying</li>
            <li>Good quality which is expected from this brand.</li>
            <li>So pretty and perfect for everyday wear, this color does look different depending on the angle and your skin tone.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first about how it will look on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Young nieces will enjoy.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using OPI nail polishes</li>
            <li>either way i love the color just the same.</li>
            <li>Plus Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li>i really like neutral shades.</li>
            <li>More lavender than the pink</li>
            <li>First this is a perfect formula, 2 coats and easy to work with if you polish slow, but not so thin that it goes everywhere.</li>
            <li>In the right light it pulled slightly pink.</li>
            <li>the color was lighter than the original one of the same that i had gotten @</li>
            <li>Not exactly as I thought it would look, but still ok..</li>
            <li>Just put a clear top coat on after and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be a little more on the nude side</li>
            <li>but I know it&#x27;s not equivalent to the kind of dark that fits my personal description!</li>
            <li>Not too light, not too dark.</li>
            <li>Kind of a grayish pale pink.</li>
            <li>This is a beautifully soft and feminine shade of pink unlike any other I have ever seen (and I am a huge light pink nail color wearer).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased them both from Amazon and have received more compliments on these two nail colors in the past two weeks than I have in years of wearing polish.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever, especially with OPI base and top coats, nice color, needs 2 coats.</li>

            <li> hard to find the right neutral color.</li>
            <li> Love this color.. not a candy pink, not too pale, opaque..slightly pale grey/lilac..</li>
            <li> Pros is the long lasting of the nail polish, I did a pedicure with it</li>
            <li> I used that &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; polish that goes on between coats and it was a little old.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> but overall its a nude-ish pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li> The nail polish arrived on the last expected day of shipment and</li>
            <li> I am black, brown skin, tone is very similar to singer Aaliyah.</li>
            <li> The cons is it did become a little yellow after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had the polish on for about 4 days so its a little darker than it was initially.</li>
            <li> If you are pale/ have pink undertones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nude with a slight slight pink hint to it.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I look at reviews on here for nail polishes, the reviewers are mentioning that they&#x27;re dark with olive undertones....</li>
            <li> but it is a pale purple color.</li>
            <li> Very hard to describe, maybe a grey nude?</li>
            <li> But in the wrong light it looked grey and sickly.</li>
            <li> Was not pleased and I will not be using this polish.</li>
            <li> awful color, looks pink in photos</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> awful color!!!</li>

            <li> the color was lighter than the original one of the same that i had gotten @ my salon!</li>

            <li> Looks so great on my hands and feet</li>
            <li> Only &amp;#34;pink &amp;#34;  I like on my skin tone, which is tan/sallow.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want something to look too bubble gum at my age.  This is gorgeous, almost a beige/pink, matte color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find the right neutral color.</li>
            <li> this color is so gorgeous. I was hesitant at first about how it will look on my skin tone. Omg get this color it&#x27;s so pretty. I posted a couple photos.</li>

            <li> Acolor must have its great salmon color</li>
            <li> Love the color and the quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey with a hint of purple. OPI - great quality as always.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully soft and feminine shade of pink unlike any other I have ever seen (and I am a huge light pink nail color wearer). It will greatly compliment any skin color from light to dark. If you like this color you may also want to try OPI You&#x27;re Such a Budapest. I recently purchased them both from Amazon and have received more compliments on these two nail colors in the past two weeks than I have in years of wearing polish. They are well worth trying and I have no doubt will become two of your favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s a great look for the entire year if you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth!  It&#x27;s a nude with a slight slight pink hint to it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using OPI nail polishes and I could see pros and cons. Pros is the long lasting of the nail polish, I did a pedicure with it and it lasted for more than 2 weeks. The cons is it did become a little yellow after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the shipping and handling it was great I had no problems.</li>

            <li> This color is perfect. Not too light, not too dark. Just wish it didn&#x27;t chip so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it! The nail polish arrived on the last expected day of shipment and the color is exactly as pictured!! It looks like the picture must have some shiny top coat on because I am looking at my nails right now and they are not as shiny as the picture.

            <li> Like the service and packaging.  The price was good and color was perfect.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> awful color, looks pink in photos but it is a pale purple color. Requesting to send it back.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, classy, elegant.</li>
            <li> another great shade. i thought it would be a little more on the nude side but it looks pinkish when it&#x27;s on my nails. either way i love the color just the same. i really like neutral shades.</li>
            <li> Color is completely different than what is on the picture. Was not pleased and I will not be using this polish.</li>
            <li> This is just the perfect shade, my new go to color. Very hard to describe, maybe a grey nude? I think it also depends on skin tone. Perfect for all seasons.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brand and I scored big for christmas. She loves the coverage and color. I think it made her christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique polish. First this is a perfect formula, 2 coats and easy to work with if you polish slow, but not so thin that it goes everywhere. This polish sometimes looked ashy on my yellow undertones. I have light- medium skin. In the right light it pulled slightly pink. But in the wrong light it looked grey and sickly. If you are pale/ have pink undertones this would probably be the perfect neutral polish for you.</li>
            <li> great color. Kind of a grayish pale pink.</li>
            <li> Amazing Color. Good quality which is expected from this brand. Love it.</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS!! :) Plus Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> This color was more of a light mauve shade than nude. It went on well but required multiple coats.</li>
            <li> More lavender than the pink I thought it was, but it goes on nicely and smooth.</li>
            <li> The color looks just as pictured. Kind of a darker nude. Goes on great. Two coats and it&#x27;s perfect. Just put a clear top coat on after and it lasts a very long time. I ordered with free shipping and it still came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> I love it. ...absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> awful color!!! and unlike pictures. I am very disappointed:(</li>
