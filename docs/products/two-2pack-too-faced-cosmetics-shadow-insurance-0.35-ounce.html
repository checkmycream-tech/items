            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>This is great value, working good too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Great product and fantastic price/deal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product .</li>
            <li>I have oily eyelids and some primers crease on their own before I even put on eye make-up</li>
            <li>I used to purchase from Sephora at the mall but found this to be a much better deal, price wise.</li>
            <li>Has nice silky finish and stays put too.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product and the seller, I got these very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love love this product</li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow primer.  </li>
            <li>, now I shall be wearing more eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>but I was ok with that for the price.</li>
            <li>After using it I fell in love and needed to stock up ... not a crease in my shadow since I started using it ♡</li>
            <li>This smooth eye shadow primer is one of my top drawer products.</li>
            <li>This product has made a HUGE difference in how well my eye shadow goes on and stay on.  </li>
            <li>Originally I got it in a set .</li>
            <li>I was when I first discovered it!</li>
            <li>So far, though, I love it.</li>
            <li>I think some people are just born lucky and without this problem, but my face produces an abundance of oil and this product does wonders at keeping it contained so that my eye shadow stays exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>authentic  product same size and price for one at Ulta/Sephora</li>
            <li>but this one is worth it because it really does make a difference when applying eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>You do have to apply a reasonable coat, as you&#x27;re essentially prepping a canvas for paint, and make sure you get the corner creases of the eye.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff for way cheaper than the company&#x27;s amazon storefront is selling it for.</li>
            <li>It holds up very well all day.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy as well.  </li>
            <li>The product is NOT the same as the original.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it enhances your eye shadow and helps it last all day long.</li>
            <li>It might not make a difference if you just need an eyelid primer and other brands have worked fine for you</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have purchased from an actual makeup store just without the price markup that a retail store can give you.</li>
            <li>(obviously my lids are clean and dry when it&#x27;s applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw this used frequently on YouTube makeup tutorials and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>So far, this dramatically lessens that effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Wording on the boxes is different - on the counterfeit it says it lasts &amp;#34;up to 24 hours&amp;#34;; the real product leaves off the &amp;#34;up</li>
            <li>I have even woken up the next day with my eye makeup still looking professionally applied!</li>
            <li>you only need a little, its not too oily or too dry, i just love it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried tons of them, cheap and expensive, and none of them work like the real</li>
            <li>The real product&#x27;s box is a little longer&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This doesnt even dry after  </li>
            <li> this is one of the only products i have actually finished, and a small tube used every day lasted me like two years.</li>
            <li> and i plan to, after i use up all my other primers.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I do notice I have to let the product sit longer than other primers</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for this primer, I use a small amount and smear it over my eyelids and my shadows stay put.</li>
            <li> When lounging around the the house makeup-free on the weekend I will often still apply Shadow Insurance just to keep my my natural skin oils at bay and out of my eyes (no more late night stinging eyeballs)!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of having my eyeshadow crease up over the course of a workday.</li>
            <li> I also believe that this is a fake product as well.</li>
            <li> This is a fake!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of the only products i have actually finished, and a small tube used every day lasted me like two years. you only need a little, its not too oily or too dry, i just love it and i would recommend it, and yes i would buy it again and i plan to, after i use up all my other primers. also, no eye irritation!</li>
            <li> Love love this product</li>
            <li> This is the best eye primer I have ever used, I never have creased when I use this product. This is exactly what I have purchased from an actual makeup store just without the price markup that a retail store can give you.</li>
            <li> It works but you have to give it some time to learn how to make it work</li>
            <li> Love this eye shadow primer.  You only need a small amount and it lasts all day.  Great value for money</li>
            <li> I saw this used frequently on YouTube makeup tutorials and thought I would try it. This price was excellent. The product itself creases on my eyelid before I even put the shadow on. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again and will give one of the tubes away.</li>
            <li> This is a fake! The product is NOT the same as the original. I want my money back! The packaging and product consistency is not the same.</li>
            <li> It is the best out there, and this was a great deal for the 2, I equated vs the one and costs and good price.  I have also checked around and done hours of research to confirm this is the best out there, now I shall be wearing more eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it enhances your eye shadow and helps it last all day long. A great buy for your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of having my eyeshadow crease up over the course of a workday. So far, this dramatically lessens that effect.

            <li> This is the real stuff for way cheaper than the company&#x27;s amazon storefront is selling it for. It didnt come in a box but I was ok with that for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and fantastic price/deal. A little goes a long way for this primer, I use a small amount and smear it over my eyelids and my shadows stay put. 2 tubes will last me forever. Very satisfied with the product and the seller, I got these very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is COUNTERFEIT. It might not make a difference if you just need an eyelid primer and other brands have worked fine for you but I&#x27;ve tried tons of them, cheap and expensive, and none of them work like the real Too Faced Shadow Insurance does for me. I have oily eyelids and some primers crease on their own before I even put on eye make-up (obviously my lids are clean and dry when it&#x27;s applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post photos of the boxes from this product versus the product I got at Sephora afterward.&lt;br /&gt;The differences are that:&lt;br /&gt;- The boxes are a different blue (slightly)&lt;br /&gt;- The real product&#x27;s box is a little longer&lt;br /&gt;- Wording on the boxes is different - on the counterfeit it says it lasts &amp;#34;up to 24 hours&amp;#34;; the real product leaves off the &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real product is what you want if you have had problems finding primers that work in the past.</li>
            <li> Have been using the stuff for years now, but still remember how in awe I was when I first discovered it! I truly thought I as doomed to bear the dreaded &amp;#34;eye shadow crease line&amp;#34; for the rest of my makeup wearing days and assumed anyone else who didn&#x27;t was a freak of nature. How in the world did they keep their eye shadow from softening up over the course of the day and collecting in the crease line of their upper lids? I think some people are just born lucky and without this problem, but my face produces an abundance of oil and this product does wonders at keeping it contained so that my eye shadow stays exactly as it should. I have even woken up the next day with my eye makeup still looking professionally applied! When lounging around the the house makeup-free on the weekend I will often still apply Shadow Insurance just to keep my my natural skin oils at bay and out of my eyes (no more late night stinging eyeballs)! I used to purchase from Sephora at the mall but found this to be a much better deal, price wise.</li>
            <li> This is great value, working good too.</li>
            <li> My favorite primer!!!! Excellent price! Bigger tubes! Arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I dont get the eyeshadow crease I do when I dont use it.  The deal for 2 is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Yeah I have used this brand for a while #1 the consistency of the actual primer is not the same and neither is the color. I also believe that this is a fake product as well. This doesnt even dry after  you put it on!!</li>
            <li> This smooth eye shadow primer is one of my top drawer products. You can apply either powder or cream eye shadow over it. Has nice silky finish and stays put too.</li>
            <li> authentic  product same size and price for one at Ulta/Sephora</li>
            <li> This product has made a HUGE difference in how well my eye shadow goes on and stay on.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It holds up very well all day.  I never have problems with creasing or fading eyeshadows.  It is very creamy as well.  I do notice I have to let the product sit longer than other primers but this one is worth it because it really does make a difference when applying eye shadow.  It works well with all of my eye shadows as well.  Very good product and a great price!</li>
            <li> Amazing product . Originally I got it in a set . After using it I fell in love and needed to stock up ... not a crease in my shadow since I started using it ♡</li>
