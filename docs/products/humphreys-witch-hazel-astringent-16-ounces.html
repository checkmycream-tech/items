            <li>Good price &amp; delivered to my door..</li>
            <li>Good quality product, but the top of one of the bottles was damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li>Depending on your usage, this could be a good product at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>An old fashioned medication that is the best.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel has so many uses and Humphreys is by far the best!</li>
            <li>So be patience :)&lt;</li>
            <li>it reminds me of tea tree oil and its multi purpose use. :)</li>
            <li>As an astringent it gets the job done, my favorite Witch Hazel Astringent is from Primavera.</li>
            <li>Many people are deceived by the label of 100% Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great and has many other uses.</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my face (with cotton balls) and the amount of dirt that comes of is amazing.</li>
            <li>I wish this product didn&#x27;t smell so strongly of alcohol.</li>
            <li>none of them smell as strongly as this one.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine for that.</li>
            <li>I have been very thrilled with this product, it is soothing and does what needs to be done for the skin of a senstitive individual.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a straightforward product, so</li>
            <li>add it to my son&#x27;s bath water to calm his eczema</li>
            <li>what i like about it is that it&#x27;s very gentle, but i dont think it did anything to my face</li>
            <li>It is indeed ethyl alcohol and safe for topical use</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I received my shipment, and items are exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottles where,good deal</li>
            <li>some on a cloth lay one eyes obviously closed and they give that refreshing feel</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure of this, as all other witch hazel products I&#x27;ve seen on the market are ISOPROPYL based, which cannot be consumed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is what I used while I was pregnant and after childbirth to relieve hemorrhoids and the key word for containing alcohol should be &amp;#34;Distilled&amp;#34; That word alone means there is alcohol used in the process.</li>
            <li>I make sure to always have a few bottles laying around.</li>
            <li>, toner could be applied on dry skin because most of the time it doesnt have alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Astringent is the same time as toner but since it contains alcohol, its helps with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have done a lot of research on finding the right products for my facial skin care.</li>
            <li>unfortunately it&#x27;s not labelled properly in the advertising.  </li>
            <li>packs, bottles are pretty big.  </li>
            <li>website gives a clear picture of Witch Hazel and its toxins and alcohol content.</li>
            <li>Chemicals are absorbed through the skin, so if it&#x27;s not safe to eat, I&#x27;d be reluctant to put it on skin, too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ... and so for the price, I&#x27;m quite happy with it. I got a 4-pack cheaper than I could have bought four bottles at the store, so it worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been very thrilled with this product, it is soothing and does what needs to be done for the skin of a senstitive individual.</li>
            <li> i just read the review from march 2010, it has 14% alcohol... unfortunately it&#x27;s not labelled properly in the advertising.  i was going to use it for hemorrhoid treatment but it&#x27;s of no use with the alcohol.  i&#x27;ll have to use it for acne or as a skin conditioner.  it&#x27;s \\&quot;let the buyer beware.\\&quot;  i of course read the product description as anyone would, it&#x27;s a straightforward product, so why read the review ?  i even entered in the search engine for amazon--pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li> what i like about it is that it&#x27;s very gentle, but i dont think it did anything to my face, i however prefer its smell to that of dickinson</li>
            <li> I have braids so I pour it on my head&#x27;s itchy parts and the cooling is immediate. I also use it to clean my face (with cotton balls) and the amount of dirt that comes of is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has been used in my family for three generations! &amp;#34;Agua Maravilla&amp;#34; - indeed!</li>
            <li> I called Humphreys to inquire whether the alcohol used in this product was ethanol, and was told it is indeed ethyl alcohol (same thing.)  I wanted to make sure of this, as all other witch hazel products I&#x27;ve seen on the market are ISOPROPYL based, which cannot be consumed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this product does not label itself for internal consumption, and probably warns to not consume it. But, for my uses, I do intend to consume this (very very small amounts.) Also, I do not like applying to my skin, anything I would not consume either. Chemicals are absorbed through the skin, so if it&#x27;s not safe to eat, I&#x27;d be reluctant to put it on skin, too.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of research on finding the right products for my facial skin care. Being combination (oily and dry) it was so hard to know if i&#x27;m using the right products.&lt;br /&gt;After researching a ton of stuff about the different needs my combo skin needs, some  of the things were  astringent and toner.&lt;br /&gt;These were the things i never had in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, toner could be applied on dry skin because most of the time it doesnt have alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Astringent is the same time as toner but since it contains alcohol, its helps with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily routine are&lt;br /&gt;cleanser&lt;br /&gt;toner (dry skins)&lt;br /&gt;astringent (oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;moisture my face.&lt;br /&gt;sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;Night is the same routine but i would exfoliate every other day, exclude sunscreen and replace the moisture with night-cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a big difference from the last 10+ years of scaring since i used the product. Less acne and scars. All of this takes time. So be patience :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be used for other purposes including ingrown nails,  blistered skin etc. seriously, just look it up. it reminds me of tea tree oil and its multi purpose use. :)</li>
            <li> Good quality product, but the top of one of the bottles was damaged in shipping. Other than that I have had no problems with it. I use it on my face everyday, and in some of my homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> Great value for the product.  Save 50% by ordering online. Does a great job of eliminating ingrown hairs, skin blemishes, and improving skin quality.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellant and they ship nationwide since they do not have witch hazel here. I use it as a base for deodorizer and as a make up cleaner and toner.</li>
            <li> I wish this product didn&#x27;t smell so strongly of alcohol. All the witch hazel products I use have about 14 per cent alcohol yet none of them smell as strongly as this one. As an astringent it gets the job done, my favorite Witch Hazel Astringent is from Primavera.</li>
            <li> I use it as an astringent. Works great, smells great and has many other uses. I make sure to always have a few bottles laying around.</li>
            <li> There was no product discription and no reviews to read so I bought a pig in a poke. This witch hazel contains 14% alcohol. Not for internal use. But I will use it for shaving refreshment. Gave it one star because of insufficient info. The service was very good.</li>
            <li> http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/science-publications-and-resources/resources/canadian-medicinal-crops/medicinal-crops/hamamelis-virginiana-l-witch-hazel/?id&#x3D;1300905460520&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This website gives a clear picture of Witch Hazel and its toxins and alcohol content. For those suffering from hemorrhoids, the 14% alcohol is not going to hurt, or sting like one would think. This is the proper cure for them. It is indeed ethyl alcohol and safe for topical use but still I would never swallow Witch Hazel itself, unless it was a tea form made from the leaves. Pick up the edible form at the Health Food Stores because &amp;#34;astringents&amp;#34; should never be put in your mouth. This is what I used while I was pregnant and after childbirth to relieve hemorrhoids and the key word for containing alcohol should be &amp;#34;Distilled&amp;#34; That word alone means there is alcohol used in the process.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottles where,good deal though.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for your eyes in the morning&lt;br /&gt;Pour some on a cloth lay one eyes obviously closed and they give that refreshing feel&lt;br /&gt;Good for face and doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like them other products</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; delivered to my door.. how could I be disappointed?? ;)</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk. Witch hazel has so many uses and Humphreys is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome! I had clear skin within just a few days of using it! You will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Depending on your usage, this could be a good product at a cheap price. But beware that it does contain alcohol and is not pure witch hazel, making it unusable for general things like a face toner.&lt;br /&gt;We add it to my son&#x27;s bath water to calm his eczema and it seems to work fine for that.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment, and items are exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 packs, bottles are pretty big.  Got it for a homemade product that I needed to make.</li>
            <li> An old fashioned medication that is the best.</li>
            <li> Many people are deceived by the label of 100% Witch Hazel. This product does contain 14% alcohol. According to the manufacture: \\&quot;Ingredients: Distilled Certified Organic Extracts of Witch Hazel, Containing Certified Organic Alcohol 14%.\\&quot; See [...]</li>
