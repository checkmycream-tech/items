            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>bioré shine control oil blotting sheets work better for me, but they&#x27;re trickier to find nowadays.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have tried a dozen brands of these.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it absorbs the oil just as it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I also love the size of the sheets and the amount that are in the pack.</li>
            <li>Took a chance on these and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I think I like them better than the Proactiv sheets.  </li>
            <li>Oh I love it</li>
            <li>They work ok</li>
            <li>but I have to use more than one sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I love these MK Beauty Blotters.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these absorning tissues.</li>
            <li>the amount inside is great, so that I don&#x27;t run out of them really fast.</li>
            <li>For less than the others , the Mary Kay ones (which also come with more per pack) work just as great!!!!</li>
            <li>AND REALLY DOES DO A NICE JOB OF TAKING AWAY THE SHINE WITH NO BUILD UP.  </li>
            <li>after using Clean&amp;Clear decided to try something new, and pretty happy about this buy so far.</li>
            <li>However, Mary Kay blotters are bigger in dimension, which is nice.</li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t my favorite oil absorbing sheets, but they do the job,  I&#x27;d rather buy the clean and clear sheets</li>
            <li>A must have for me especially in the summer when I shine the most and don&#x27;t want to continue powdering my face.</li>
            <li>Definitely takes the oil and shine off your face without having to cake on more powder on those areas that are prone to oil.</li>
            <li>The clean and clear blue ones are way better.</li>
            <li>The clean and clear ones have always been my favorit and nothing</li>
            <li>The reason I gave these blotters 4 stars is because they do not work as well as Palladio face blotters, which are thicker than Mary Kay&#x27;s (which has the feel of a toilet seat liner paper), so the Palladio face blotters absorb more oil</li>
            <li>Took out too much oil (?) -</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin...especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>These are okay, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Each sheet is twice as big as clean an clear and does the job.</li>
            <li>pro: the flap closes into the package easily, unlike a lot of other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;con: the sheet doesn&#x27;t absorb as much oil as some of the others do.</li>

            <li> after using Clean&amp;Clear decided to try something new, and pretty happy about this buy so far. Each sheet is twice as big as clean an clear and does the job.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost is more expensive than the actual cost. Sob! Sob! Other than that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this product!</li>
            <li> pro: the flap closes into the package easily, unlike a lot of other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;con: the sheet doesn&#x27;t absorb as much oil as some of the others do. bioré shine control oil blotting sheets work better for me, but they&#x27;re trickier to find nowadays.</li>
            <li> Simply, they work. Removes grease sheen / layer without removing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Other brand I used for a time actually affected appearance of face. Took out too much oil (?) - but after a year I was looking old.&lt;br /&gt;So, returned to beauty blotters - 20 years now (?).  Am in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have tried a dozen brands of these. The clean and clear ones have always been my favorit and nothing compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great if looking for a better prices alternative! For less than the others , the Mary Kay ones (which also come with more per pack) work just as great!!!! They remove any excess oil without taking off my makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it absorbs the oil just as it is supposed to do and it doesn&#x27;t take off your makeup.  I also love the size of the sheets and the amount that are in the pack.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactiv oil blotter sheets for years.  I am not a Proactiv member so I had to order from Amazon or some other marketplace.  It was time to reorder, and I could not find them anywhere.  Took a chance on these and boy am I glad I did.  These are great! I think I like them better than the Proactiv sheets.  There are fewer in the box, BUT they&#x27;re thicker and I only need one at a time vs. 2 and 3 to get the job done.  Also, I like the fact that they matte the skin, but do not leave a powdery look.  I may be switching to these for now on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know I needed them until I got them.  It soaks up oil off my skin and keeps my makeup looking good throughout the day. Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh I love it,I share it with everyone I see that has oily skin to me.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> works great. does the job. doesnt ruin make up. (tip: blot dont wipe. hence the name blotters.)</li>
            <li> These papers make a lot of noise.  They work ok but I have to use more than one sometimes.  The clean and clear blue ones are way better.</li>
            <li> As a photographer, I keep these with me to help clients control their shine.  They are awesome and men don&#x27;t mind using them.  Men don&#x27;t like to use powder!  LOL!</li>
            <li> These are okay, but not worth the money. The Clean&amp;Clear blotters are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE LARGER SIZE AND REALLY DOES DO A NICE JOB OF TAKING AWAY THE SHINE WITH NO BUILD UP.  WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t my favorite oil absorbing sheets, but they do the job,  I&#x27;d rather buy the clean and clear sheets</li>
            <li> Product delivered as promised. I&#x27;m a IBC but didn&#x27;t have it in stock. Amazon prime shipping was awesome.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin...especially in the summer. I go through a face blotter every 1-3 hours. These do the job without leaving any residue, which some blotters have a powder. The reason I gave these blotters 4 stars is because they do not work as well as Palladio face blotters, which are thicker than Mary Kay&#x27;s (which has the feel of a toilet seat liner paper), so the Palladio face blotters absorb more oil and I use less blotter paper than I do with Mary Kay. However, Mary Kay blotters are bigger in dimension, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I love these MK Beauty Blotters. They are perfect for my oily forehead and nose. I use a couple sheets a day at work. One around late mornings and another towards the end of the day. They do not disturb my make-up and looks like I&#x27;ve applied powder after using. A must have for me especially in the summer when I shine the most and don&#x27;t want to continue powdering my face.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes the oil and shine off your face without having to cake on more powder on those areas that are prone to oil.</li>
            <li> great price, works well</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these absorning tissues. I carry them in my purse and use one in the middle of the day as a I have oily skin. They work great at removing the excess oil from my face.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Removes the oil, gives your skin a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I like these Oil Blotter Sheets the amount inside is great, so that I don&#x27;t run out of them really fast.</li>
