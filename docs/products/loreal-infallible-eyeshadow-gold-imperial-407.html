            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t believe what a beautiful gold</li>
            <li>This gold eye shadow color was easy to apply, had the right sparkle under the lights and was easy to wash off!!!</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow is a very pretty shade, and the color is definitely as bright as I needed it to be, but I would like a better consistency.</li>

            <li>im glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This color is so fabulous!</li>
            <li>.This is lovely.</li>
            <li>but ,for longer wear (more than 6 hours)it did seem to transfer everywhere when I didn&#x27;t use primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love Love LOOOOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more is the to say?</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>its stunning.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to all my girlfriends. :)</li>
            <li>It is just a lovely shimmery gold that makes your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeshadow :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>...trust me you will love this product if you buy it</li>
            <li>Very nice, this adds so much glow with the gold color</li>
            <li>Super gold and dense pigmentation, my favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture: Let me describe it the best way I can, it&#x27;s somewhere in between loose pigment and cream?</li>
            <li>I used this for color for the young girls in my dance company and it was a hit, even the parents thought it was great.</li>
            <li>its not its powder u just have to smooth it out some and it will be ok</li>
            <li>Imperial is truly a special color!</li>
            <li>Have not found a true gold gold until this!</li>
            <li>This shadow goes on smoothly and is very saturated with bright gold color.  </li>
            <li>just go easy.</li>
            <li>you can put on too much easily.</li>
            <li>, it has a creamy texture so it doesnt fall off easy</li>
            <li>stays on well and comes off easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine without any</li>
            <li>So I ended up using my fingers and that was fine.</li>
            <li>Lovely item, quick shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li>Its light and goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheap powder that you can&#x27;t see once applied.</li>
            <li>This L&#x27;Oreal Infallible eyeshadow Gold Imperial 407 is a very sparkley warm gold color.  </li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>I have light brown eyes and this looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I must say, I have never been more satisfied with a product color in my whole life.</li>
            <li>i would have liked it to be more dark gold but its still nice</li>
            <li>Some fall out but color is worth it!</li>
            <li>but i love that the transaction was super fast and smooth.....</li>
            <li>The gold color is exactly what I wanted - more sunny golden than orange.  </li>
            <li>Very metallic and shiny just like most infallible eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>TRUE TO SIZE</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get better the whole day.  </li>
            <li>that really goes to show how much I love this eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even used eyelid primer that I know to be great with my other shadows</li>
            <li>and it is SUPER shiny.  </li>
            <li>Super convient I just apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Super sparkly gold eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Its not as bold as what I was looking for</li>
            <li>makes it look much more vibrant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So I offered it to my college aged daughter, and she was just THRILLED!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shadow.</li>
            <li>its not flashy at all!</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t as excited for it at first</li>
            <li>That with a little eyeliner and mascara look great.  </li>
            <li>Go on smooth and packaging really has kept them from drying out.</li>
            <li>I realized after applying it to my middle aged eyes, however, it is not the best look for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful.  </li>
            <li>WOW, I love the color, goes on like cream.</li>
            <li>I honestly looked at it several times before buying and</li>
            <li>pretty pretty pretty !!</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of Urban Decay Eye shadow, but I say some amazing reviews on L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The gold is true gold and it is very shinny...</li>
            <li>so it stays on better on your eyes because it is a fine powder that doesn&#x27;t stick as well as it could, but that&#x27;s expected with something like this.  </li>
            <li>and it goes great with blue eyes (i have blue eyes).</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>This gold shadow is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>I love gold eyeshadow *yellow or bronzy* colors.</li>
            <li>it is like applying gold leaf to your eyelid, so it isn&#x27;t exactly fitting for a mid thirties mom to wear to church or the PTA or grocery store, etc.</li>
            <li>Ive used lots of golds from all different brands and im in love with this one.</li>
            <li>I love the color, so I wish it was different.  </li>
            <li>I love gold eyeshadows, but I&#x27;m only going to buy this one again.</li>
            <li>It was EXACTLY the color of eyeshadow</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s a lovely gold which accentuates your lids, prior to adding a darker accent color on the outer edge.</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well with primer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am assuming this is do to the glitter other than that it is really nice</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that loose glitter elegant shine look, you&#x27;ve found it right here.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived, the product was like pure butter.</li>
            <li>&quot; so that it doesn&#x27;t move around everywhere (smart idea).</li>
            <li>I think if it wasn&#x27;t for the powder or pigment press, the eyeshadow would lean more towards \\&quot;loose pigment.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So hard to find a good gold glitter metallic eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I was on a crazy makeup spree when I came across this, and it was the absolute best makeup purchase I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li>very gold shadow.</li>
            <li>I use it to highlight my eyes and it really makes them pop.</li>
            <li>The color fits me very well, and it wouldn&#x27;t drop to my face.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped fast and the product was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Really gold, just a pictured.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not even a high end name brand!</li>
            <li>For the price, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much</li>
            <li>I really like this gold.</li>
            <li>nice but can get messy</li>
            <li>It is more of a white gold than a yellow.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve replaced a lot of my high end shadows for these.</li>
            <li>To picture what the eyeshadow looks on, imagine Cinna from the Hunger Games eyeliner or a high fashion gold foil eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>im 15 in high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is right up there with MAC, Sephora, Lorac, Naked, etc.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a reasonably priced GOLD eyeshadow (no not burnt gold, bronze, or copper...GOLD!).</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a good yellow gold eye shadow  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>its also very soft of a color..</li>
            <li>First affordable cream eyeshadows I have owned that really do stay on all day with no creasing, fading or looking dry and cakey.</li>
            <li>You can pack  it on for an intense color or sheer it out as a wash.</li>
            <li>I know have almost every color that this line offers.  </li>
            <li>WOW, my mind was blown.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much fallout (especially when I pat it on with my brush) and patting it on</li>
            <li>SO MANY compliments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a LITTLE bit for a glow look (I call it the J-LO look) or a lot of it for a more dramatic look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is bold and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what i wanted and it stays on long!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure how many of you have had the same problem as I did.</li>
            <li>Eyelids w/ a dark grey above it, for awhile now, &amp; got more compliments on it.</li>
            <li>This a very high pigmented single.</li>
            <li>Love the shimmer but packaging leaves the powder messy and I avoid using it vs my other eyeshadow pallets that are</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and lasts a really long time especially with a primer.</li>
            <li>but I barely use it.  </li>
            <li>I have a pot in amber rush color that is over a year old and still same consistency and wear.</li>
            <li>If I were a teen with a flashy outfit wanting to go clubbing, to a party or on a date with a really hot guy I might enjoy using it a lot.  </li>
            <li>It applys on a little flakey are first, but then you find yourself getting used to the application.</li>
            <li>It has a nice little plastic disc inside to keep the powder packed down firm.</li>
            <li>Use your fingertips and you can add as little or as much as you like to your eyelids.</li>

            <li> I think its amazing.</li>
            <li> It is very sparkly and perfect for holiday looks.</li>
            <li> i liked the eyeshadow its nice</li>
            <li> It goes on kind of clumped, in one concentrated space.</li>
            <li> and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap!</li>
            <li> but it was a nice settle gold to my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s BY FAR the best gold I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> The makeup is smooth and looks good on.</li>
            <li> Perfect shimmer, without looking glittery or young.  </li>
            <li> and ........ LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t believe what a beautiful gold</li>
            <li> This gold eye shadow color was easy to apply, had the right sparkle under the lights and was easy to wash off!!!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is a very pretty shade, and the color is definitely as bright as I needed it to be, but I would like a better consistency.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly love the fact i didnt pay shipping the product itself</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow.</li>

            <li> This color is so fabulous!</li>
            <li> .This is lovely.</li>
            <li> but ,for longer wear (more than 6 hours)it did seem to transfer everywhere when I didn&#x27;t use primer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love Love LOOOOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li> its stunning.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to all my girlfriends. :)</li>
            <li> It is just a lovely shimmery gold that makes your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeshadow :)</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> ...trust me you will love this product if you buy it</li>
            <li> Very nice, this adds so much glow with the gold color</li>
            <li> Super gold and dense pigmentation, my favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture: Let me describe it the best way I can, it&#x27;s somewhere in between loose pigment and cream?</li>
            <li> I used this for color for the young girls in my dance company and it was a hit, even the parents thought it was great.</li>
            <li> its not its powder u just have to smooth it out some and it will be ok</li>
            <li> Imperial is truly a special color!</li>
            <li> Have not found a true gold gold until this!</li>
            <li> This shadow goes on smoothly and is very saturated with bright gold color.  </li>
            <li> just go easy.</li>
            <li> you can put on too much easily.</li>
            <li> , it has a creamy texture so it doesnt fall off easy</li>
            <li> stays on well and comes off easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine without any</li>
            <li> So I ended up using my fingers and that was fine.</li>
            <li> Lovely item, quick shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> Its light and goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheap powder that you can&#x27;t see once applied.</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal Infallible eyeshadow Gold Imperial 407 is a very sparkley warm gold color.  </li>
            <li> Smooth application.</li>
            <li> I have light brown eyes and this looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I must say, I have never been more satisfied with a product color in my whole life.</li>
            <li> i would have liked it to be more dark gold but its still nice</li>
            <li> Some fall out but color is worth it!</li>
            <li> but i love that the transaction was super fast and smooth.....</li>
            <li> The gold color is exactly what I wanted - more sunny golden than orange.  </li>
            <li> Very metallic and shiny just like most infallible eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> TRUE TO SIZE</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get better the whole day.  </li>
            <li> that really goes to show how much I love this eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even used eyelid primer that I know to be great with my other shadows</li>
            <li> and it is SUPER shiny.  </li>
            <li> Super convient I just apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Super sparkly gold eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Its not as bold as what I was looking for</li>
            <li> makes it look much more vibrant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So I offered it to my college aged daughter, and she was just THRILLED!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite shadow.</li>
            <li> its not flashy at all!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t as excited for it at first</li>
            <li> That with a little eyeliner and mascara look great.  </li>
            <li> Go on smooth and packaging really has kept them from drying out.</li>
            <li> I realized after applying it to my middle aged eyes, however, it is not the best look for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I love the color, goes on like cream.</li>
            <li> I honestly looked at it several times before buying and</li>
            <li> pretty pretty pretty !!</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of Urban Decay Eye shadow, but I say some amazing reviews on L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The gold is true gold and it is very shinny...</li>
            <li> so it stays on better on your eyes because it is a fine powder that doesn&#x27;t stick as well as it could, but that&#x27;s expected with something like this.  </li>
            <li> and it goes great with blue eyes (i have blue eyes).</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> This gold shadow is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> I love gold eyeshadow *yellow or bronzy* colors.</li>
            <li> it is like applying gold leaf to your eyelid, so it isn&#x27;t exactly fitting for a mid thirties mom to wear to church or the PTA or grocery store, etc.</li>
            <li> Ive used lots of golds from all different brands and im in love with this one.</li>
            <li> I love the color, so I wish it was different.  </li>
            <li> I love gold eyeshadows, but I&#x27;m only going to buy this one again.</li>
            <li> It was EXACTLY the color of eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a lovely gold which accentuates your lids, prior to adding a darker accent color on the outer edge.</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty well with primer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am assuming this is do to the glitter other than that it is really nice</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that loose glitter elegant shine look, you&#x27;ve found it right here.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived, the product was like pure butter.</li>
            <li> &quot; so that it doesn&#x27;t move around everywhere (smart idea).</li>
            <li> I think if it wasn&#x27;t for the powder or pigment press, the eyeshadow would lean more towards \\&quot;loose pigment.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So hard to find a good gold glitter metallic eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I was on a crazy makeup spree when I came across this, and it was the absolute best makeup purchase I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> very gold shadow.</li>
            <li> I use it to highlight my eyes and it really makes them pop.</li>
            <li> The color fits me very well, and it wouldn&#x27;t drop to my face.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped fast and the product was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Really gold, just a pictured.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even a high end name brand!</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much</li>
            <li> I really like this gold.</li>
            <li> nice but can get messy</li>
            <li> It is more of a white gold than a yellow.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve replaced a lot of my high end shadows for these.</li>
            <li> To picture what the eyeshadow looks on, imagine Cinna from the Hunger Games eyeliner or a high fashion gold foil eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> im 15 in high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is right up there with MAC, Sephora, Lorac, Naked, etc.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a reasonably priced GOLD eyeshadow (no not burnt gold, bronze, or copper...GOLD!).</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a good yellow gold eye shadow  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> its also very soft of a color..</li>
            <li> First affordable cream eyeshadows I have owned that really do stay on all day with no creasing, fading or looking dry and cakey.</li>
            <li> You can pack  it on for an intense color or sheer it out as a wash.</li>
            <li> I know have almost every color that this line offers.  </li>
            <li> WOW, my mind was blown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much fallout (especially when I pat it on with my brush) and patting it on</li>
            <li> SO MANY compliments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a LITTLE bit for a glow look (I call it the J-LO look) or a lot of it for a more dramatic look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is bold and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what i wanted and it stays on long!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how many of you have had the same problem as I did.</li>
            <li> Eyelids w/ a dark grey above it, for awhile now, &amp; got more compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This a very high pigmented single.</li>
            <li> Love the shimmer but packaging leaves the powder messy and I avoid using it vs my other eyeshadow pallets that are</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and lasts a really long time especially with a primer.</li>
            <li> but I barely use it.  </li>
            <li> I have a pot in amber rush color that is over a year old and still same consistency and wear.</li>
            <li> If I were a teen with a flashy outfit wanting to go clubbing, to a party or on a date with a really hot guy I might enjoy using it a lot.  </li>
            <li> It applys on a little flakey are first, but then you find yourself getting used to the application.</li>
            <li> It has a nice little plastic disc inside to keep the powder packed down firm.</li>
            <li> Use your fingertips and you can add as little or as much as you like to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> eventhough its in a very small package its worth it</li>
            <li> Last set all day &amp; it lastest a long time, so you&#x27;re not buying it every month</li>
            <li> Its highly pigmented, loose powder add a little or alot depending on the look you are going for.</li>
            <li> Instead of being loose powder or cream, this seemed to be somewhere in the middle...</li>
            <li> You can use it as regular eyeshadow or wet the tip of an eye shadow brush and coat it with this product to make eye liner that pops.</li>
            <li> I tried using different brushes and it only makes a mess and won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t quite come loose like loose pigment or loose eyeshadow does.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; part is the packaging, which seems to be upside down to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to the urban decay collection from Sephora, if not better.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t behave as I expected</li>
            <li> The color payout wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> BUT the Eyeshadow is messy and will smear on your eyelids after long wear....</li>
            <li> It can be hard for me to wear some golds because they can come out to be brassy, but this is completely different than any gold e/s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Once on my eyes I could use other eye shadow colors with the brushes and it didn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> and it was less than in Walmart.  </li>
            <li> it was like thick powder that was just wet enough to clump together and make it hard to put on.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Minimal mess.</li>
            <li> The product is packed in tightly by a \\&quot;press\\</li>
            <li> I apply using my little finger.  </li>
            <li> A little messy going on</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated I finally decided to pay a bit extra and buy it</li>
            <li> It looks kinda small</li>
            <li> but as soon as I twisted that cap open and took off the color press...</li>
            <li> I usually buy at least one of them to try them out.</li>
            <li> I hardly had to put any on my eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li> All I could find were dull, burnt, orange-ish, yellow-ish colors.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes not give this 5 stars is the consistency of the powder seems a little wierd like a cream base but</li>
            <li> and I use it for almost every event now, difficult to apply though.</li>
            <li> At  such an affordable price how could you go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> but it was just flaking off onto my cheeks bad.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing though because once applied...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color.  I would suggest using this with a primer so it stays on better on your eyes because it is a fine powder that doesn&#x27;t stick as well as it could, but that&#x27;s expected with something like this.  With a primer it stays on amazingly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly love the fact i didnt pay shipping the product itself is gorgeous  i lub it would definetely recomend</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. The only products (drug store) that I can use are Almay and L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow. The color is beautiful and it came fast :D</li>
            <li> A little messy going on but I love the color</li>
            <li> Awesome creamy product that leaves a lovely even metallic finish on my eyes.  The only &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; part is the packaging, which seems to be upside down to me.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is a very pretty shade, and the color is definitely as bright as I needed it to be, but I would like a better consistency. Instead of being loose powder or cream, this seemed to be somewhere in the middle... it was like thick powder that was just wet enough to clump together and make it hard to put on.</li>
            <li> very gold shadow. good staying power.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. Nice color!</li>
            <li> just go easy. you can put on too much easily.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow I found on preen.com when browsing. It is amazing and is very bright glittery true to color gold.</li>
            <li> I bought this and OMG! I get SO MANY compliments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a LITTLE bit for a glow look (I call it the J-LO look) or a lot of it for a more dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;Either way it&#x27;s BY FAR the best gold I have ever seen. I have bought 3 more in case they ever discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow</li>
            <li> absolutely love this eyeshadow. its shimmery and bright. stays on. eventhough its in a very small package its worth it</li>
            <li> I love the color of the eye shadows, and the quality is also excellent. Perfect for night makeup, it looks very nice.</li>
            <li> I had cataract surgery 2 years ago and since then simply didn&#x27;t even try to wear eye makeup because I have to use eye drops often during the day.  Powder eyeshadow was always causing me distress when it ended up getting in my eyes or on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;THIS eyeshadow goes on creamy, lasts all day and NEVER gets in my eyes even when I use eyedrops.  I use two different colors, a darker one in the corner and one to spread over the rest of the eyelid.  I apply using my little finger.  Lovely colors.</li>
            <li> This is a beautif gold color with lots of sheen and some glitter...I realized after applying it to my middle aged eyes, however, it is not the best look for me.  So I offered it to my college aged daughter, and she was just THRILLED!</li>
            <li> Very nice, this adds so much glow with the gold color, it has a creamy texture so it doesnt fall off easy and it stays in place.</li>
            <li> It can be hard for me to wear some golds because they can come out to be brassy, but this is completely different than any gold e/s I&#x27;ve tried. It is very sparkly and perfect for holiday looks. It is more of a white gold than a yellow. Very metallic and shiny just like most infallible eyeshadows. I love this one.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Gold Color!!!</li>
            <li> This gold shadow is really pretty. It is bold and long lasting. I use it to highlight my eyes and it really makes them pop. It is the perfect gold and the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li> A bit too glittery for my taste. Amazing price compared to drugstore. If u r glittery, then u need this</li>
            <li> Very pigmented! Love this</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE....REALLY BEAUTIFUL COLOR PERFECT PRICE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND....LOOKING FORWARD TO PURCHASING MORE COLORS....TRUE TO SIZE</li>

            <li> I love this eyeshadow!! It makes my blue eyes pop. It stays on pretty good. I get lots of compliments. It&#x27;s not the cheap powder that you can&#x27;t see once applied. Very good product.</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal Infallible eyeshadow Gold Imperial 407 is a very sparkley warm gold color.  That with a little eyeliner and mascara look great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good! It&#x27;s useful.  The color fits me very well, and it wouldn&#x27;t drop to my face. So I like it!</li>
            <li> Very good pigment, a true gold shadow which I had to find on line to get... Some fall out but color is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes twinkles with this gorgeous one xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your finger when you put on this on your eyes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful color. Smooth application. Great looking eyes.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t tell if I like it or not.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 mos but I barely use it.  it seems like quality powder but it doesn&#x27;t behave as I expected and it is SUPER shiny.  If I were a teen with a flashy outfit wanting to go clubbing, to a party or on a date with a really hot guy I might enjoy using it a lot.  it is like applying gold leaf to your eyelid, so it isn&#x27;t exactly fitting for a mid thirties mom to wear to church or the PTA or grocery store, etc.</li>
            <li> WOW, I love the color, goes on like cream. The makeup is smooth and looks good on. The seller shipped fast and the product was packaged well. I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Used this for prom and I use it for almost every event now, difficult to apply though.</li>
            <li> This a very high pigmented single. Just like the picture. Stays on all day and actually lives up to the name; infallible.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, arrived on time, the color ir perfect and rasonable price, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted this gold color and it was less than in Walmart.  I stopped buying department store eyeshadow when I discovered this Infallible brand.  This shadow goes on smoothly and is very saturated with bright gold color.  I know have almost every color that this line offers.  The best your money can buy!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color!! Very pigmented and lasts a really long time especially with a primer.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I&#x27;m a freelance MUA and I&#x27;ve replaced a lot of my high end shadows for these. This is right up there with MAC, Sephora, Lorac, Naked, etc. If you&#x27;re looking for that loose glitter elegant shine look, you&#x27;ve found it right here. I love them!</li>
            <li> Ive used lots of golds from all different brands and im in love with this one. I honestly looked at it several times before buying and im glad I did. Its highly pigmented, loose powder add a little or alot depending on the look you are going for. Great when paired with a bronzy summer glow</li>
            <li> The gold color is exactly what I wanted - more sunny golden than orange.  However, I wear contacts, and every time I wear this eyeshadow, my eyes are red and bleary within an hour of application.  It doesn&#x27;t get better the whole day.  I love the color, so I wish it was different.  Maybe this is inherent to metallic shadows?</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s looks amazing !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This color is so fabulous! I have a hard time finding a good yellow gold eye shadow  .This is lovely. It has a nice little plastic disc inside to keep the powder packed down firm. I hardly had to put any on my eye shadow brush.I would however ,recommend using primer or even white eyeliner to keep it in place for a longer time.It&#x27;s fine without any but ,for longer wear (more than 6 hours)it did seem to transfer everywhere when I didn&#x27;t use primer.</li>
            <li> JUst what I wanted. Really gold, just a pictured.  Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> LOVE this gold shimmer shadow! If you want that &amp;#34;real housewife&amp;#34; shimmery sparkly eyelid - this product rocks and it&#x27;s not even a high end name brand! If you want to experiment with gold shimmery shadow this is a good start!</li>
            <li> I used this for color for the young girls in my dance company and it was a hit, even the parents thought it was great. This gold eye shadow color was easy to apply, had the right sparkle under the lights and was easy to wash off!!! At  such an affordable price how could you go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> I was on a crazy makeup spree when I came across this, and it was the absolute best makeup purchase I have made on Amazon. For the price, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much but when it arrived, the product was like pure butter. Just touching the cap leaves your finger covered in this beautiful coat of gold. It&#x27;s very similar to the urban decay collection from Sephora, if not better. I love gold eyeshadows, but I&#x27;m only going to buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. It was EXACTLY the color of eyeshadow she was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love it! To picture what the eyeshadow looks on, imagine Cinna from the Hunger Games eyeliner or a high fashion gold foil eye makeup. It&#x27;s fantastic! If you have Black/brown skin, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not showing up because it won&#x27;t dissapoint. You can use it as regular eyeshadow or wet the tip of an eye shadow brush and coat it with this product to make eye liner that pops.</li>
            <li> nice but can get messy</li>
            <li> First affordable cream eyeshadows I have owned that really do stay on all day with no creasing, fading or looking dry and cakey. Always get compliments when I wear them too. Perfect shimmer, without looking glittery or young.  Go on smooth and packaging really has kept them from drying out. I have a pot in amber rush color that is over a year old and still same consistency and wear. Super convient I just apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Another beautiful color in the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Eyeshadow line.  This one&#x27;s a lovely gold which accentuates your lids, prior to adding a darker accent color on the outer edge.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOOOOVE it. The color won&#x27;t wear out. I put it on my lids at 8 am and washed it off at 11 pm, and all the while it had its shimmery, brilliant gold glow. Highly recommended. It&#x27;s AWESOME. Love it</li>
            <li> One of the best gold eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love it. The color is so beautiful!</li>
            <li> i liked the eyeshadow its nice i would have liked it to be more dark gold but its still nice</li>
            <li> Super sparkly gold eyeshadow. What more is the to say? It&#x27;s beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> Really beautiful and sparkly. The color does migrate, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Looks like gold dust.</li>
            <li> Lovely item, quick shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> I think its amazing. So hard to find a good gold glitter metallic eyeshadow This was exactly what i wanted and it stays on long!</li>
            <li> The color payout wasn&#x27;t what I expected. But it&#x27;s doable.</li>
            <li> You must be patient with this makeup though because you will have to use your fingertips to blend it in. I tried using different brushes and it only makes a mess and won&#x27;t work. Use your fingertips and you can add as little or as much as you like to your eyelids. Very cute gold color though. I have blue eyes so gold colors work for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. this shade is amazing!!!! i get compliments on it all the time. im 15 in high school. i wear it evry day. its not flashy at all! and it goes great with blue eyes (i have blue eyes). its stunning. its also very soft of a color.. i would recommend using a brush.. it doesent come with any applicater..</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes not give this 5 stars is the consistency of the powder seems a little wierd like a cream base but its not its powder u just have to smooth it out some and it will be ok I am assuming this is do to the glitter other than that it is really nice I am over all happy with everything!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on the way I imagined. It goes on kind of clumped, in one concentrated space.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of Urban Decay Eye shadow, but I say some amazing reviews on L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Eyeshadow. So, I thought I would give it a try and ........ LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I think it actually stays on longer than UD. I would recommend this to all my girlfriends. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for those with hazel eyes and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap! Perfect</li>
            <li> I like the color. Its not as bold as what I was looking for but it was a nice settle gold to my eyes.</li>
            <li> If I could give 6 stars I would! pretty pretty pretty !! Have not found a true gold gold until this! Couldn&#x27;t find at stores either. Stays on pretty well with primer. gives a wonderful glow</li>
            <li> I really like this gold. It is just a lovely shimmery gold that makes your eyes pop. It arrived on time which was like 10 days or so from the time I ordered it. It looks kinda small but now that I&#x27;ve used it I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be used up anytime soon!  A little goes a long way. I tried to use my makeup brushes to apply the eye shadow but it was just flaking off onto my cheeks bad. So I ended up using my fingers and that was fine. Once on my eyes I could use other eye shadow colors with the brushes and it didn&#x27;t make a mess. The color is just beautiful!  I would buy again and I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> the product is just like the picture. stays on well and comes off easy. its a gorgous color. i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this color on my. Eyelids w/ a dark grey above it, for awhile now, &amp; got more compliments on it. Last set all day &amp; it lastest a long time, so you&#x27;re not buying it every month</li>
            <li> The gold is true gold and it is very shinny...I love the color BUT the Eyeshadow is messy and will smear on your eyelids after long wear....I even used eyelid primer that I know to be great with my other shadows and it still smeared across my eyelid...</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous!!! I feel like queen with gold flakes for eyeshadow. Very very happy. My favorite eyeshadow :)</li>
            <li> Love this. I have light brown eyes and this looks fabulous. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very nice eyeshadow i just received it and i couldnt stop smiling when i was putting it on..i was eveen dancing too thats how beautiful it is...trust me you will love this product if you buy it looks just like the pic in a nice beautiful container</li>
            <li> Super gold and dense pigmentation, my favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> My Favorite eye shadow and color of all time!!</li>
            <li> Love! Gorgeous color. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how many of you have had the same problem as I did. I searched high and low for a reasonably priced GOLD eyeshadow (no not burnt gold, bronze, or copper...GOLD!). All I could find were dull, burnt, orange-ish, yellow-ish colors. However, I wanted a bright beautiful Egyptian goddess gold! Well this was it, a friend had told me about it and I could never find it in stores. I was so frustrated I finally decided to pay a bit extra and buy it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I must say, I have never been more satisfied with a product color in my whole life. I received this promptly in the mail and I wasn&#x27;t as excited for it at first but as soon as I twisted that cap open and took off the color press...WOW, my mind was blown. I gave it a swatch and I really couldn&#x27;t believe what a beautiful gold it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Let me describe it the best way I can, it&#x27;s somewhere in between loose pigment and cream? The product is packed in tightly by a \\&quot;press\\&quot; so that it doesn&#x27;t move around everywhere (smart idea). I think if it wasn&#x27;t for the powder or pigment press, the eyeshadow would lean more towards \\&quot;loose pigment.\\&quot; Also, when I dip my make up brush into it, it doesn&#x27;t quite come loose like loose pigment or loose eyeshadow does. This is why I think it somewhat resembles cream eyeshadow. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing though because once applied...it blends so well! I don&#x27;t get much fallout (especially when I pat it on with my brush) and patting it on makes it look much more vibrant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeshadow has been added to my all time favorites which include lots of luxury and high-end brands as well -so that really goes to show how much I love this eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Imperial is truly a special color!</li>
