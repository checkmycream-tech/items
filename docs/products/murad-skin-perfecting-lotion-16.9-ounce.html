            <li>I love this moisturizer, it feels like a bit much when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I loved the price for this quantity, more than purchasing a small tube every time I ran out (I use it 2x/day).</li>

            <li>I very much like this product, I&#x27;ve being using it for over twenty years.  </li>

            <li>However, what I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that it wasn&#x27;t sealed so you can&#x27;t be 100% certain that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not positive this item was authentic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great that might skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel heavy like some moisturizers can.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling sensation and that deep down clean feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and gets dry easily so it was tough finding a good product.</li>
            <li>My skin is 58 years old and very oily and acne prone.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and fast supplier.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combo/acne prone skin and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. This is a universal lotion, and I highly recommend it for all skin types. It leaves the skin smooth and hydrated without being greasy. And I love that it has anti-aging and anti-acne benefits.</li>
            <li> Been using Murad for 6 months now.  It doesnt remove eye makeup well but removes foundation ( weird I know)  I love the cooling sensation and that deep down clean feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li> I have used Murad products for a couple of years now and love them. This product had great reviews. The first day I used it no problem. The second day my face started swelling and itching . I know products work differently for everyone. I would not order the large bottle until you use the product for a few days. It seems to have a delayed effect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried that many skin products, but this one I can see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive this item was authentic. I had tried the three day sample and was won over. This arrived in the mail and I was so excited to use it. My skin reacted quite differently. It helped with chronic dryness and scaly patches but it also brought on some pretty deep blemishes that I haven&#x27;t dealt with in years.</li>
            <li> This lotion is an excellent product for a great price. I have used Murad for a couple of years after having discovered it in the business class bags on Cathay Pacific. I think most of their products are great. If you already use this product, this large size professional bottle is an extremely good price.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally oily and prone to breakouts. This and Clinique are the only moisturizers that work for me. This feels lighter, yet still substantial as a moisturizer. I finally bought the large version and it&#x27;s been lasting forever!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it feels like a bit much when you first put it on but it gradually soaks in and makes your skin feel great. As I have started using it during our Chicago winter it&#x27;s great that might skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel heavy like some moisturizers can. We will see it may be too moisturizing for the humidity of summer, but I doubt it since it absorbs so well. I am prone to breakouts around my chin and have had no issues what so ever with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will be what I use from now on!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect perfection, be patient and you will notice improvement.  I have a lot of sun damage and I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. My skin is extremely sensitive and gets dry easily so it was tough finding a good product. It&#x27;s a tad expensive but buying the 16.9 ounce bottle is definitely worth it and will save you a ton compared to the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Murad is a product I have been using for years. After spending years trying to find the right products for my skin, I have definitely found it!</li>
            <li> i changed to this lotion after using another for 20 years&lt;br /&gt;i had an allergic skin reaction&lt;br /&gt;severe itching and swollen face&lt;br /&gt;had to go to the Dr and do a 1 week streroid regimen&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend you do not use this product</li>
            <li> I knew this lotion from my beauty salon. It has the creamy texture without being sticky or too heavy.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product,  good buy from amazon</li>
            <li> This is a favorite product of mine. Light weight on the skin, absorbs fast ,you can apply your make up minutes after applying the lotion. Good after tanning &amp; before bed also. I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> A truly wonderful product , love All Dr Murads products. Perfecting Day Lotion is wonderful for teenagers</li>
            <li> love this lotion. feels good on my face. i wish it had sunblock in it!!!</li>
            <li> I very much like this product, I&#x27;ve being using it for over twenty years.  However, I didn&#x27;t like the fact the the packaging was not seal by the manufacture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.  It keeps my skin clear.  My skin is 58 years old and very oily and acne prone.  This keeps the oil controlled.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion as a moisturizer every day for a while now, but I would buy the smaller tubes at Sephora. I&#x27;m so thankful I found this on Amazon because this thing is HUGE!! So the price you pay for the giant bottle is totally worth it. For the small bottle you are paying $19.17 per ounce, ($33 for 1.7 ounces), whereas this one you are averaging around $5 per ounce (approx $90 for 16.9 ounces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to order this in the future.</li>
            <li> huge bottle but not sure on the lotion</li>
            <li> The best facial lotion your skin just drinks it up. Feels extremely soft and smooth a two drops can moisturize your entire face.</li>
            <li> I loved the price for this quantity, more than purchasing a small tube every time I ran out (I use it 2x/day). However, what I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that it wasn&#x27;t sealed so you can&#x27;t be 100% certain that its the legitimate product. But, it feels and smells similar to the product sold in smaller tubes.</li>
