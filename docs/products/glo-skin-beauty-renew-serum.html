            <li>I was about to spend about $150 on a Lancome serum and then decided to go with this one because my dermatologist suggested her mother used it and liked it.  </li>

            <li>Bottle Top Broke, Product All Over Inside Of box</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was so glad I found it on Amazon, because the cost is 1/2 of what it is in most salons.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>I am greatly pleased with the results and will continue to use this every night before bed.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum every day for 2 months, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Love love this product</li>
            <li>, it seems like pomegranites or something kind of sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>I was able to notice a huge difference after a week.</li>
            <li>This smells funny and kind of burns my skin, I&#x27;ve bought from the salon before and it didn&#x27;t have this smell or burn.</li>
            <li>Thus is a fantastic product for someone with fine wrinkles and acne.  </li>
            <li>Light serum, works well.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>She reiterated what I knew to be true.  </li>
            <li>I always put it at night, and my skin is nice and soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really seems to be improving my skin by limiting the # of blemishes I have.  </li>
            <li>however it appears to me that you need to use it daily for good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but it does take some time getting accustomed to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a certain companies $80 serum (eeh-hmmmlancomefromparis), and it was nowhere near as good as this.  </li>
            <li>I can see the mild exfoliation and &amp;#34;skin renewal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Consistent use of this syrum has transformed my acne prone skin, won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing the next day.</li>
            <li>In my effort to try to be better informed about serums for my aging sking (58 years old) I spoke to my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>This product is great--it makes my skin have a nice glow and the occasional blemish is gone virtually overnight!  </li>
            <li>You should definitely try this product if you want a nice serum that packs a punch.</li>
            <li>I still have my acne scars that I&#x27;m hoping will fade over time, but I am so happy to have my clear skin back.</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price).</li>
            <li>A year ago when I was using my first bottle, I was applying this right after I had used Glo-Therapeutic&#x27;s Anti-Blemish Treatment.</li>
            <li>asking, &amp;#34;what happened to your eye?&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more products in the future on here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first noticeable thing about this product is its smell and color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate regularly, this serum will not work as good if you don&#x27;t help rid the dead skin off of your face.</li>
            <li>I would get those huge cystic type pimples that would last for weeks and leave scars.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my facial expert who has fabulous skin.  </li>
            <li>and I must say it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum for a while now &amp; it has really helped fade out my sun &amp; age spots</li>
            <li>To much surpise</li>
            <li>voila... molted skin right smack near the windows to the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected it arrived really quick!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think i will reorder again.</li>
            <li>I began to notice my skin was looking firmer and had more moisture retention, giving it a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin; there were no eczema spots, there was no itching, or any other problems.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that people go get a facial first as they really helped me figure out what I should do to help my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s way more gentle than the harsher and more expensive versions by company&#x27;s like Natura Bisse!</li>
            <li>Went without for around one month, and jumped right back in.</li>
            <li>I just now ordered my 2nd bottle, my first bottle lasted 3 months</li>
            <li>After a week or so, my zits would stop hurting and stop getting bigger, but the red bumps would still be on my face for up to a full month afterward.</li>
            <li>I like this serum for clear complexion &amp; it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use this product once a week and to maintain a clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply it near your eyes at all</li>
            <li>You will be surprised.  </li>
            <li>(But I don&#x27;t use this every night).&lt;br /&gt;3. 1% retinol in such a reasonably priced product is unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne and bought this product as a hopeful solution.</li>
            <li>there is a slight sting after you prep your face, but its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Use it slowly at first to introduce the active ingredients to your skin if you&#x27;re not exfoliating much - 2 times a week for the first 2 weeks and work your way up to every other night.</li>
            <li>I got introduced to this product two years ago, when I had a facial at a new salon.  </li>
            <li>I generally move from product to product but have stuck with the acne cleanser and renew serum for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the only thing to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>I went to get a professional facial and was introduced to Glo therapeutics from my aesthetician.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the salon or the aesthetician, but I loved the serum they used</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>I usually apply one drop for each area (forehead, left cheek, right cheek, chin and nose).</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s a long time for me!</li>
            <li> No more acne, and my skins complexion is glowing and clear.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little off the product so the bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a medicinal yellow with the typical medicine type smell.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of not buying this directly from glo, but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My skin has a glow that was missing before and my pores are noticeably smaller.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for a few years since the esthetician used it during a facial.</li>
            <li> and yup, it dried it out, turned it a bit red, and</li>
            <li> Return is not free as this is a third party seller.</li>
            <li> Within a few days you will notice firmer skin and smaller pores.</li>
            <li> Bottle seems to be almost empty.  </li>
            <li> There was minimal peeling and no redness or itching.</li>
            <li> timely and items were as expected</li>
            <li> Having oily, olive complexed skin, with monthly breakouts (ugh), black heads on my nose, slight age spots on my checks, and a dull complexion (really, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hideous</li>
            <li> My skin cleared slightly, and didn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I use this every other night</li>
            <li> It helps diminish the appearance of wrinkles and dark spots too.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to have cleared up some of the blemishes and slight imperfections in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it pays to return.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for the cosmetic counters even when I know that the ingredient is what I should be looking for.  </li>
            <li> I would always have at least 3 or 4 at a time and as soon as one would heal, another would come.</li>
            <li> This product works without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> the price (we all know how expensive retinol can be)</li>
            <li> My skin is not flaky anymore and no more break outs!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be very unhappy if they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying it under my eye like a moron</li>
            <li> It was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I find the smell terrible though.</li>

            <li> Great product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for the cosmetic counters even when I know that the ingredient is what I should be looking for.  Chemicals are chemicals and don&#x27;t change.  In my effort to try to be better informed about serums for my aging sking (58 years old) I spoke to my dermatologist.  She reiterated what I knew to be true.  Look for the proper ingredients and don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I was about to spend about $150 on a Lancome serum and then decided to go with this one because my dermatologist suggested her mother used it and liked it.  The dermatologist carried the line and told me if I did not like it I could bring it back.  I used the product at night for 7 days and love it.  It definitely makes my skin feel smoother.  It also seems to have cleared up some of the blemishes and slight imperfections in my skin.  I also like the smell, it seems like pomegranites or something kind of sweet smelling.  The price is much better than the cosmetic counter products and it was recommended by a dermatologist and it works.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product. Helps  control acne and oily skin. Have been using for a year and has helped decrease breakouts.</li>
            <li> Consistent use of this syrum has transformed my acne prone skin, won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> This smells funny and kind of burns my skin, I&#x27;ve bought from the salon before and it didn&#x27;t have this smell or burn. I think it&#x27;s a knock off</li>
            <li> Enhances skin&#x27;s appearance and helps to diminish wrinkle after several applications. I will buy more...</li>
            <li> It exfoliates skin and leaves skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few years since the esthetician used it during a facial.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I order it every month. Makes your skin glow. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Light serum, works well. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years. Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my facial expert who has fabulous skin.  I grilled her on all things facial related and she swears by the Renew Serum.  Having oily, olive complexed skin, with monthly breakouts (ugh), black heads on my nose, slight age spots on my checks, and a dull complexion (really, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hideous but I need all the help I can get skin wise).  So I gave this a try.  I have to say this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve come across (and I&#x27;m a beauty product freak).  It helps the overall look of my skin - smoother and glowing skin.  I would highly recommend that people go get a facial first as they really helped me figure out what I should do to help my skin.  This was their best recommendation for me.  I have to warn you though, for people with dry/sensitive skin, I&#x27;m thinking this may aggregate you.  Don&#x27;t apply it near your eyes at all or you might regret it (can&#x27;t have people looking at you asking, &amp;#34;what happened to your eye?&amp;#34;).  I made the mistake of applying it under my eye like a moron and yup, it dried it out, turned it a bit red, and voila... molted skin right smack near the windows to the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price (we all know how expensive retinol can be), this was a steal and I&#x27;d be very unhappy if they discontinued it.  I&#x27;ve tried a certain companies $80 serum (eeh-hmmmlancomefromparis), and it was nowhere near as good as this.  So, it&#x27;s a part of my daily routine and I thought I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using that serum for about three years now and I must say it really works. I always put it at night, and my skin is nice and soft in the morning. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for a while now &amp; it has really helped fade out my sun &amp; age spots</li>
            <li> Love this product. The only product that actually works. I was able to notice a huge difference after a week. I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I loe goo-therapeutics products. It seems to be the only thing to keep my face clear. I break out a lot and I&#x27;ve even been depressed because of it. My sister introduced me to these products and now I use them religiously. I have tried so many products and have even been prescribed medication but somehow this it the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> Looking at good reviews, I purchased it. I never applied around eyes but it still caused burning in my eyes. Also, it didn&#x27;t show any good results on face, it rather worsened my acne. Might have worked for others but it did not suit my skin. Return is not free as this is a third party seller. I got this in an envelope which was not properly sealed. Normally such items arrive in boxes.</li>
            <li> This serum solved my never ending problems. My skin is not flaky anymore and no more break outs!!!!! Not once ever since I started applying this serum. Use it slowly at first to introduce the active ingredients to your skin if you&#x27;re not exfoliating much - 2 times a week for the first 2 weeks and work your way up to every other night. Follow with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Notice effects almost immediately.  Within a few days you will notice firmer skin and smaller pores. I use this product every night and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I use this every other night &#x3D;) I usually apply one drop for each area (forehead, left cheek, right cheek, chin and nose). I can see the mild exfoliation and &amp;#34;skin renewal&amp;#34;. Perfect for those blackheads &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Bottle Top Broke, Product All Over Inside Of box</li>
            <li> finished this bottle. I think it&#x27;s a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think i will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product arrived damaged.  Bottle seems to be almost empty.  Not sure if it pays to return.</li>
            <li> It made me break out, I felt that quilts wasn&#x27;t the same as I purchased at the salon</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Went without for around one month, and jumped right back in. I feel the improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> This product works without irritating my skin. There was minimal peeling and no redness or itching. The pores by my nose appeared smaller and my skin was smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really seems to be improving my skin by limiting the # of blemishes I have.  It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to this product two years ago, when I had a facial at a new salon.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the salon or the aesthetician, but I loved the serum they used and I bought a bottle to try.  I was so glad I found it on Amazon, because the cost is 1/2 of what it is in most salons.  This product is great--it makes my skin have a nice glow and the occasional blemish is gone virtually overnight!  It helps diminish the appearance of wrinkles and dark spots too.  You should definitely try this product if you want a nice serum that packs a punch.</li>
            <li> This product and cleansing acne wash are two that I will continue to buy. I generally move from product to product but have stuck with the acne cleanser and renew serum for almost a year now. That&#x27;s a long time for me!</li>
            <li> I never suffered with acne until two years ago when I turned 28. It was AWFUL. I would get those huge cystic type pimples that would last for weeks and leave scars. I would always have at least 3 or 4 at a time and as soon as one would heal, another would come. I finally went to a med spa to get a chemical peel and the aesthetician told me about this stuff. She said to exfoliate every night and then apply this renew serum and it would help with the acne and the scarring.  I started using this renew serum just since October and I am acne free!! I still have my acne scars that I&#x27;m hoping will fade over time, but I am so happy to have my clear skin back. I just now ordered my 2nd bottle, my first bottle lasted 3 months (so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price). I saved $12 dollars ordering it here on amazon instead of buying it from the med spa.  It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate regularly, this serum will not work as good if you don&#x27;t help rid the dead skin off of your face. But exfoliating and this renew serum together are like magic!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to help fade pigmentation on my face. I tried so many products.  I went to get a professional facial and was introduced to Glo therapeutics from my aesthetician. I am greatly pleased with the results and will continue to use this every night before bed. there is a slight sting after you prep your face, but its not bad at all. I have seen a difference on my face and the pigmentation is lighter. Finally a product that says what it does and does it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum if you are looking to unearth your best skin for a reasonable price and it&#x27;s way more gentle than the harsher and more expensive versions by company&#x27;s like Natura Bisse!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of not buying this directly from glo, but I was pleasantly surprised! The product was exactly what I expected it arrived really quick! My skin looks great and I love it. I will be buying more products in the future on here.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference however it appears to me that you need to use it daily for good results.</li>
            <li> I like this serum for clear complexion &amp; it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman, and was introduced to this serum in 2010 by my sister. Let me tell you, I was scared that it would not work on my skin, which is oily and acne prone. To much surpise I LOVE LOVE this serum. Glow skin, glow. No more acne, and my skins complexion is glowing and clear. You will be surprised.  Great product.</li>
            <li> *take my review with a grain of salt. I do use other skin care products in my routine that works for me and everyone has different skin and different products that works wonders for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first noticeable thing about this product is its smell and color. It&#x27;s a medicinal yellow with the typical medicine type smell. It&#x27;s not bad but it does take some time getting accustomed to. A year ago when I was using my first bottle, I was applying this right after I had used Glo-Therapeutic&#x27;s Anti-Blemish Treatment. I began to notice my skin was looking firmer and had more moisture retention, giving it a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin; there were no eczema spots, there was no itching, or any other problems. Overall, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week and to maintain a clear complexion.  It goes on really silky and has a great scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum every day for 2 months, it&#x27;s just ok. My skin cleared slightly, and didn&#x27;t dry out. I find the smell terrible though. I was hoping for a little more exfoliation. I&#x27;ll use this until it&#x27;s out, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> timely and items were as expected</li>
            <li> Thus is a fantastic product for someone with fine wrinkles and acne.  It helps a great deal with both without over drying your skin.  It only takes a little off the product so the bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to your skincare regime. It&#x27;s a serum used at night to revitalize and renew the skin. I saw results from this within a week.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it has 3 important ingredients in one bottle to keep your skin looking good.</li>
            <li> 1. My skin looks amazing the next day. If I have an upcoming event this goes on the night before!&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not dry out my skin (But I don&#x27;t use this every night).&lt;br /&gt;3. 1% retinol in such a reasonably priced product is unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;4. My skin literally \\&quot;Glo\\&quot;s after use.&lt;br /&gt;5. Pores get smaller after use&lt;br /&gt;6. Has glycolic &amp; salacylic acid mixed in as well&lt;br /&gt;7. Keeps acne at bay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne and bought this product as a hopeful solution. I used it for 3 months, and it definitely made my face feel softer and fresher. However, it did not help with my acne. I was still having big, sore zits form on my face, and the serum was not helping them go away. After a week or so, my zits would stop hurting and stop getting bigger, but the red bumps would still be on my face for up to a full month afterward. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a way to freshen up their face, but not for an acne solution.</li>
            <li> Love love this product</li>
