            <li> Removed surface stains really well.</li>
            <li> These are very old and dried out.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it does what it says but it&#x27;s not good on sensitive teeth such as mine.</li>
            <li> It was old and hard and I could not use it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times as I don&#x27;t want to wear away enamel (which was mentioned in other reviews) and I already see stains going away.  </li>
            <li> I have a few teeth which get stained even though I don&#x27;t drink black coffee or tea.  </li>
            <li> It was all dried up when I received it.</li>
            <li> Very small pkgs.</li>
            <li> Dried Out completely useless</li>
            <li> Was too dry and impossible to get out of small cups, bad taste.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>

            <li> Was too dry and impossible to get out of small cups, bad taste. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Now I can polish my teeth just like the Dentist!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Dried Out completely useless</li>
            <li> on time and as described.  This is just like the hygenist uses, and with my sonic toothbrush seems to polish my tooth nicely.</li>
            <li> It was all dried up when I received it. Useless.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times as I don&#x27;t want to wear away enamel (which was mentioned in other reviews) and I already see stains going away.  If I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t wear away enamel I would rate it 5 stars</li>

            <li> Tooth polish that you can use at home, just like the polish your dentist uses. Very small pkgs. Works well.</li>
            <li> These are very old and dried out. I will not purchase again.</li>

            <li> I love this product!!!! I am very pleased!!</li>
            <li> it is not the product that you find at your dentist..not even close</li>
            <li> Works awesome at removing stains. I give it 4 stars because it does what it says but it&#x27;s not good on sensitive teeth such as mine. Had to stop using it cause it made them hurt.</li>
            <li> works beautifully. I mix the material that comes with it, plus &amp;#34;super smile&amp;#34; paste...my teeth are shiny and pearly white.</li>
            <li> I have a few teeth which get stained even though I don&#x27;t drink black coffee or tea.  This worked great to polish off a stain.  I used this in combination with an oral-b powered toothbrush, and it would probably work fine with a sonicare.</li>
