            <li> N4 is my favorite hair products.  My sister-in-law turned me on to it a few years ago and I&#x27;ve used it ever since</li>
            <li> The best shampoo out there. Beautifully packaged abd works as advertised</li>
            <li> I really see the difference! I start getting compliments about my hair day 1 I started using it. Hair feels smooth, squeecky clean, light, silky and added some shine into my blond color treated hair as well as volume. It became easy to style and after styling it adds up volume (I have very thin hair). I noticed, if I shampoo my hair and let the foam seat for awhile it gives me a more pronounced result. At first, I was concerned about the high price and wasn&#x27;t sure if it is worth it. So, I purchased the 8.5 oz shampoo bottle and didn&#x27;t order hair conditioner. But even using only shampoo and other brand conditioner I got a result! Very happy! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly.........But will buy it anyway, just trying to use as little at the time as possible, though previously I was very generous with other brands, which do not cost nearly as much. I will definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and paraben free.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product.  I bought this for her.</li>
            <li> I prefer N4 compared to any hair products. They are great for color treated hair. Will purchase again; great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my fine, thin hair..</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I only bought the travel size of the hydrating shampoo and conditioner. It stinks!  I only use it because I bought it. The conditioner makes my hair a little limp too.  I love the volumizing set, reminds me a bit of the fragrance L&#x27;air du temps..  I wish they would make all the sets with this scent.  Oh yes, and my hair looks good too. I dye my hair blonde so wanted some moisture but I compromise with coconut oil once a week.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair looks so healthy. I have short, thick, but fine hair and this shampoo is moisturizing. However, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  Lots of volume!  Smells great too.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I feel it is overpriced.  I only use a dime-sized amount and it lathers my full head of hair so, hopefully this bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo !  My hair is shiny, light, clean &amp; smells great!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I love the woodsy scent.  It&#x27;s light weight and leaves no residue.  I like that it&#x27;s paraben and sulfate free. It is spendy, but a nice treat to indulge in.</li>
            <li> i have really coarse, dry hair and sensitive skin. this stuff makes my hair so soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t freak my skin out. fan for life !</li>
            <li> Yes you will notice your hair is slinkier, but like most shampoos and romance, it wears off. It just doesn&#x27;t perform as well. It helps to use a cheaper product once in a while to spice things up, like suave or Vo5. This strips the build up off for a clean slate. Only do this once a month or your hair will dry out. Previously I used Biolage before and loved it just as much as Number 4 and a fraction of the price.  But they changed the ingredients after selling it to another company, and it&#x27;s not quite the same. But so much cheaper than this product! I have admit, I would spend the $75 again (25 fl oz). It did last a year, I used it every three days gingerly and I have a lot of hair, and long.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and body wash all in one. Makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and still love it and the conditioner. When I ran out my hair didn&#x27;t look so good.</li>
            <li> Who buys stuff that costs this much? Just once I wanted to see if there was difference. I actually think maybe there is. I am not sure it is worth the price, but it is a pleasure to use. The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great rates!</li>
            <li> Great for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. Smells great and really makes my hair soft in conjunction with the conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t ever feel as if it strips my hair. I have color treated hair that is really thick and can be really frizzy at times. Have purchased it 3 times so far and will continue to buy it. I also really love the smell as well!</li>
