            <li>I was really impressed with how long the polish lasted and that it did not chip within the first 4 days.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product and very long wearing without chipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing too much of the excess polish drying up around the top of the bottle and the applicator brush remains clean</li>
            <li>just a very nice grey, not too charcoal though.&lt;br /&gt;it seems to just go with everything !!</li>
            <li>The polish is very easy to smooth over my short nails, no dragging or brush lines.</li>

            <li>this will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I think its well worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good black but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money</li>
            <li>but i would tell anyone to get this if you like a nice black or just nail polish in general!!! :)</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Only needed one coat and shines a brilliant black color.</li>
            <li>To me its just as good as the more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>its amazing, nice and dark black like i wanted it</li>
            <li>Smooth app and lasting</li>
            <li>Luckily, the rich black hides any evident imperfections of my clumsiness.</li>
            <li>I love this black.</li>
            <li>In my area the color if black nail polish is $7.00 or more.  </li>
            <li>Its a okay nail polish you need about 2-3 coats to get that xtreme black</li>
            <li>it was only right</li>
            <li>the grey is my absolute favorite.&lt;br /&gt;it is a true grey.  </li>
            <li>I only took off one star because sometimes the overwhelming amount of crusty nail polish near the top makes it difficult to open.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this polish to anyone who is looking for lasting color without chipping or breaking!</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep this polish in high regard.</li>
            <li>its  very nice black color, its very pigmented as well an expensive brend</li>
            <li>I have Palmar Hyperhidrosis, which leaves me with soft nails that generally reject nail polish.</li>
            <li>Nothing really adheres for very long.</li>
            <li>True blue color will last about 7 days with two coats no clear needed have 43 of this product in different colors</li>
            <li>Very shiny and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and exact bottle of black nail polish for a while now.</li>
            <li>You can totally get by with a single quick coat, regardless of what some other reviewer said.</li>
            <li>I like to do 2 coats with a clear top coat &amp; it comes out fantastic...until I smudge them in my hair or something lame.</li>

            <li> Two coats and my nails are super black!!!!</li>
            <li> My bottle is a few weeks old, &amp; I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times.</li>

            <li> its  very nice black color, its very pigmented as well an expensive brend it drys very fast and the tip of the brush is really nice too. i definatelly recomenend it</li>
            <li> luv luv luv ~ i keep going back to this polish.  the grey is my absolute favorite.&lt;br /&gt;it is a true grey.  no sparkle.  note matte.  just a very nice grey, not too charcoal though.&lt;br /&gt;it seems to just go with everything !!&lt;br /&gt;long lasting.  it finally warmed up here enough so that my feet could withstand a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;ve been in socks for over 3 weeks.  polish still held up.  i can&#x27;t wait for warmer weather&lt;br /&gt;so i can put this back on my toes !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset I bought this! In stores like Target it&#x27;s half the price..( I paid about $5 with shipping). It was horribly watery and thin! I wish I could rate this a zero!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, good color, shipped quick and Sally Hansen makes really good products anyways. Would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and exact bottle of black nail polish for a while now. It works great and doesn&#x27;t chip as long as it has a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this black. Very shiny and long lasting. It is great quality, which I have come to expect from Sally Hansen products. I know every time I purchase a Sally Hansen product I am going to be pleased with the results, and this was another great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is Super Richly pigmented, I love it. I have Palmar Hyperhidrosis, which leaves me with soft nails that generally reject nail polish. Even extra hard nail polish will crack when my soft nails bend. Nothing really adheres for very long. I have managed to make this last for several days without peeling or chipping. That is a big deal for me. The polish is very easy to smooth over my short nails, no dragging or brush lines. My bottle is a few weeks old, &amp; I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times. I&#x27;m not seeing too much of the excess polish drying up around the top of the bottle and the applicator brush remains clean (I&#x27;m a bit of a slob). It&#x27;s so densely colored. You can totally get by with a single quick coat, regardless of what some other reviewer said. She/he must have gotten a bad batch or something. I like to do 2 coats with a clear top coat &amp; it comes out fantastic...until I smudge them in my hair or something lame. Every. Time. Luckily, the rich black hides any evident imperfections of my clumsiness. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Works great &amp; looks great</li>
            <li> Can be kinda shear but two coats gets the job done! Smooth app and lasting</li>
            <li> i am a gay man and i love this nail polish its a kinda shiney black but i would tell anyone to get this if you like a nice black or just nail polish in general!!! :)</li>
