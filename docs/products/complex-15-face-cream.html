            <li>If you have a DISCOVER CARD you can link your cash back bonus points to Amazon and pay for your Amazon purchases - or part of them - very easily!</li>
            <li>My skin is 63 years old, kind of oily/dry in winter.  </li>
            <li>Complex 15 Face Cream is the BEST I have found in my 80 years.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved this product so much she was experiencing total shock to see what was a $36 for 6 tubes (2.5 oz) (April 2014) to 10 times more costly today.</li>
            <li>light, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it because it&#x27;s so light and makes my face soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>However, if you do not have acne prone skin, it did moisturize well &amp; would be worth trying.</li>
            <li>A nice gentle moisturizer for my sensitive, rosacea prone skin.</li>
            <li>I wear it right under my make-up</li>
            <li>put it on right before bed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin and for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used this product and I have used it for about 10 days now.  </li>
            <li>It has several comedogenic ingredients, notably myristyl myristate.</li>
            <li>It is great for the whole family for dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for sensitive skin or for those adverse to stripping or harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I now use a combination of rose water, argan oil, and Complex 15 Face Cream to keep my face smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and it does not cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>All you need is a dime size of the product and it spreads really well</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the simple packaging, and it is nice but not critical that it is unscented.</li>
            <li>My face started to dry out more after getting older and every day washing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to use in the summer time, also effective enough to moisturizer well during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty clean with professional quality, hydrates without leaving your skin oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>It was not a thick cream like I expected, and It burned my daughters dry skin, so overall it is a fine cream, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Have been disappointed when I could not find it locally...but DELIGHTED with Amazon solved my problem!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with Complex 15.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>Complex 15 is my favorite face cream.....</li>
            <li>I used it on my body just to not let it go to waste, and I found it to be a bit light for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I love complex 15..</li>
            <li>Most face creams are too thick for me and cause skin problems.</li>
            <li>This product does not have that burning sensation that most moisturizers leave me with due to the extreme dryness of my eczema.</li>
            <li>After reading some other reviews, I see that&#x27;s true of a couple other people as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not one of the higher ranking ingredients, but for me it was enough, probably in combination with the larger amounts of the less comedogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is the only face cream I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; that is soaked up by the skin with little effort.</li>

            <li> This cart broke down when I was walking with my grocerys not stabled at all poor poor</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for sensitive skin or for those adverse to stripping or harsh chemicals.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cream, but we think it has been discontinued.  We can&#x27;t find it anywhere -- except in a couple of places that charge an arm and a leg for it.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer for skin that is hypersensitive and prone to breakouts/reactions/everything. Have been using this for many years and this is a HG. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; that is soaked up by the skin with little effort. Well worth a try if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts and are looking for a non-greasy, lightweight moisturizer to keep your face looking and feeling healthy. I rid my cabinet of harsh chemicals a few years back, but came back to this item as well as Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream because of their results.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, light, moisturizer that absorbs well and leaves your face feeling fresh, moist, but not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that does not cause m skin to break out. Just moisture thats all. Probably the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Complex 15 for several years, but now having difficulty finding it in local stores. So glad to have found it through Amazon. It is light enough to use in the summer time, also effective enough to moisturizer well during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cream I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry or too oily. Not that I&#x27;m even still looking. I&#x27;m satisfied with Complex 15. Would recommend to anyone having facial skin issues.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and indeed the cream is very good. It absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin. Is very light and looks and feels like it&#x27;s not there. There is none better for us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped spending money on expensive designer moisturizers. I now use a combination of rose water, argan oil, and Complex 15 Face Cream to keep my face smooth. The combo works. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> This cream is light, not greasy, and a very effective moisturizer.  I use it everyday under my foundation, and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  My sons even use it after they shower.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first since it was such a low price. but that was what I was looking for. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer and hydrated throughout the day. It is not a &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cream. but it does do what it claims. I will purchase again when my tube is empty</li>
            <li> Ok light moisturizer for oily skin in the summer. Not moisturizing enough in the winter though.</li>
            <li> The most amazing light cream for your sensitive face, so sad to hear it is discontinued...and those crazy prices :-(</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I use it nearly every day. I&#x27;ve dealt with acne for the past 15 years, but this has drastically helped my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Most face creams are too thick for me and cause skin problems. This is the best I&#x27;ve found. It was recommended by my brother-in-law and I thank him for it!</li>
            <li> I have used Complex 15 for a number of years after a Doctor recommended it to me for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this product and I have used it for about 10 days now.  I refuse to buy the super pricey creams when something less expensive will do.  I have had favorites through the years that always seem to be discontinued.  I ordered this one because of the good reviews and I needed to add to my order to qualify for free shipping.  So far, I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and it does not cause breakouts.  It goes on evenly and works well under my foundation.  It does not burn my eyes.  It is not greasy.  I may order it again.  This tube will last for a long time.  By the way, I like the tube instead of sticking my finger in a jar.  My skin is 63 years old, kind of oily/dry in winter.  You can&#x27;t go wrong in trying it.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 Face Cream is the BEST I have found in my 80 years.  Have used it for many years.  Have been disappointed when I could not find it locally...but DELIGHTED with Amazon solved my problem!!  Thank you.  Mary Schwarz</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is my favorite face cream.....light, it soaks right in. A little goes a long way. I wear it right under my make-up&lt;br /&gt;or put it on right before bed.</li>
            <li> A very good facial moisturizer that should be applied to damp skin for maximum effectiveness.  A little goes a long way, so it is a good value for the price. I also appreciate the simple packaging, and it is nice but not critical that it is unscented. The body moisturizer also is a fine product. The local chain pharmacies do not carry Complex 15, and I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> The lotion felt very pleasant and was fine as a moisturizer--not greasy at all. Unfortunately, I found that it exacerbated my acne. It has several comedogenic ingredients, notably myristyl myristate. It&#x27;s not one of the higher ranking ingredients, but for me it was enough, probably in combination with the larger amounts of the less comedogenic ingredients. I could see it being a great moisturizer for someone with mature/non-acne-prone skin. I used it on my body just to not let it go to waste, and I found it to be a bit light for that purpose.</li>
            <li> My face started to dry out more after getting older and every day washing. I needed to find a face cream that&#x27;s good for my skin. I came across this product on line and after reading many reviews I decided to try it. I&#x27;m loving it because it&#x27;s so light and makes my face soft and natural looking. It&#x27;s so easy and quick to apply after the shower in the mornings. My face feels clean and non-greasy and it works for me. This is my second purchase of the face cream and I will stay with it for years to come. The best moisturizer for me so far.</li>
            <li> This product does moisturize, but it made my acne flare up. After reading some other reviews, I see that&#x27;s true of a couple other people as well. If you have acne prone skin, I would not recommend this product. However, if you do not have acne prone skin, it did moisturize well &amp; would be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I love complex 15..I used to find it at cvs but cannot anymore so I order it online..it is water based no perfume and inexpensive..perfect combo</li>
            <li> This is a great product, simple and effective. Don&#x27;t require me to add more words, I see no need to be more verbose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost twenty years.  It is great for sensitive skin and for very dry skin. It was recommended by a dermatologist as it hypo-allergic.  It is great for the whole family for dry facial skin. There is a also a body lotion.  I don&#x27;t use \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot; I only use this 365 days/year.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do,  moisturizer without grease or smell.  A bargain as well.  Given to friends as a find.</li>
            <li> Buying the product in Amazon was very comfortable and once I have used it, would it do again. It came prior announced date and everything ok. The product itself is wonderful - I love it. Simple recomendable.</li>
            <li> Great product, non greasy!</li>
            <li> I love Complex 15 as a base lotion and it&#x27;s pretty clean with professional quality, hydrates without leaving your skin oily and heavy. When mixed with my therapeutic essences at Licia atelier home products it the becomes a fabulous face cream. :)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and is super light without clogging pores. A nice gentle moisturizer for my sensitive, rosacea prone skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product so much she was experiencing total shock to see what was a $36 for 6 tubes (2.5 oz) (April 2014) to 10 times more costly today.</li>
            <li> It was not a thick cream like I expected, and It burned my daughters dry skin, so overall it is a fine cream, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Wonderful greaseless..makes my face feel great.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a light moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have acne, as well as an eczema patch on my chin. This product does not have that burning sensation that most moisturizers leave me with due to the extreme dryness of my eczema. Though I do need to use something different at night to take away the flakiness, I have not noticed any acne flare ups from use of this product.</li>
            <li> I  LIKE  COMPLRX  15  IT  KEEP  MY  SKIN  NICE  AND  SMOOTH..AND  SOFT&lt;br /&gt;ALL  SO  HELP  MY  SKIN  IN  SUN  WHEN  I  GO  OUT  SIDE.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist years ago.  Use it  day and night and like that it does not feel greasy after application.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using it for over 10 years. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, no perfumes, extremely light so you can apply it at night after you wash your make-up off, then again in the morning, before applying make-up as a base moisturizer. This size tube lasts me 4-6 months. All you need is a dime size of the product and it spreads really well, it&#x27;s very affordable, great for travel as well. If you have a DISCOVER CARD you can link your cash back bonus points to Amazon and pay for your Amazon purchases - or part of them - very easily! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Cream is not greasy and rubs in easily.  My skin is no longer dry and peeling.  I would recommend it.</li>
