            <li>Since I have purchased more for family, friends, and perfect gifts.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, wasn&#x27;t impressed at all</li>
            <li>No matter, it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>idea looks nice on ad.  </li>
            <li>It helped me polish my own nails without getting polish onto my cuticles and skin.  </li>
            <li>VERY cheap and not like as seen on TV.</li>
            <li>It was a very cheap looking product.</li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I should have know better...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more work than a cotton ball or paper towel, but when I try to use those I end up taking the polish off the tip of the nails on the hand I use to do the cleaning.</li>
            <li>sexy</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY CHEAP!  </li>
            <li>but otherwise it is okay.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this for more than $10.</li>
            <li>This is a good concept, but made very cheaply....don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li>not as sturdy or easy to use as I had hoped</li>
            <li>Super Cheap!  </li>
            <li>No instructions, cheap materials.</li>
            <li>And did I mention Cheap</li>
            <li>....Cheap Cheap.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and warbled as I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>none of the grooves fit my nails as it promises to, and I returned the product to the seller.</li>
            <li>ok, but not my right hand.  </li>
            <li>(esp the right hand, as is most people&#x27;s problem).  </li>
            <li>This product would be perfect for a child or a small person.</li>
            <li>That it all that this product is worth!</li>
            <li>so i decided to open it an look at them to make sure they were all age appropriate.  </li>
            <li>It would seem that it would fit a teenie bopper, but also tickles my fancy (more mature lady).</li>
            <li>Thought would have  been a better product not as easy to use as they show gave to my younger daughter</li>
            <li>It helped a little, but didn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li>Overall this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth 5 cents.&lt;br /&gt;1).</li>
            <li>Great for when you are in a hurry or putting on red!&lt;br /&gt;Three disks with different size openings for different size nails.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an O.K. product and works better with longer nails</li>
            <li>very uncool!</li>
            <li>you will be better off just doing them the regular way.</li>
            <li>(active length nails are harder to work with on Nail Perfect) and when all my nails were painted and dry, it did have a better end result.</li>
            <li>I am large with large fingers.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;high quality\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the first thing you think of when looking at it.  </li>
            <li>This had made it so much easier for her.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really thing</li>
            <li>It does ease the job of keeping the painting of the nails straight.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes it , but at 12 I think she thinks it&#x27;s cumbersome even though it works, so who knows how much use it&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>Yet I&#x27;ve heard that some people really like it.</li>
            <li>This was really too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>VERY DIS-SATISFIED  </li>
            <li>In fact she just got a professional manicure yesterday, so one more thing for the next garage sale.</li>
            <li>The material was very cheap plastic and did not fit together very well at all.</li>
            <li>The screw on top does not tighten all the way down to hold the disk in place.&lt;br /&gt;3).</li>
            <li>I have recently gotten into doing nail art and developed a huge collection of nail accessories.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - thanks for the simple buying experience.</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and I had it in nearly no time.  </li>
            <li>the description said new.</li>
            <li>This product was cheap, flimsy, and not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Made a huge mess because would not tighten.&lt;br /&gt;5).</li>
            <li>this was a christmas gift for my thirteen year old sister and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>So again it might not have worked well for her because she was so young.</li>
            <li>Now for the product; it seems this product is a great idea on paper but to actually use it seemed a bit awkward.</li>
            <li>It is a flimsy little thing that doesn&#x27;t even come in a pretty box, or with instructions!</li>
            <li>These really do the trick, just be careful cleaning them after.</li>
            <li>Poor shapes to fit nails!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not messy at all painting my left hand, but usually mess my right up because I don&#x27;t paint as well with my left.</li>
            <li>This strange little machine really works!</li>
            <li>When I received the product, it came in a white box with a printed little sheet of the real version of this product.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these to last very long.</li>
            <li> and I think it takes alot longer to do this because you have to wait for each nail to dry between coats as opposed to painting 1 coat on each nail before applying a second coat.  </li>
            <li> Useless, cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> So far, the few times I have tried using this gadget, it has been no help at all</li>
            <li> Holding a finger in place waiting for a nail to dry....</li>
            <li> Great idea put terrible design.</li>
            <li> The nail polish chair is helpful but if your using a bottle of polish that&#x27;s almost empty</li>
            <li> this item was  as expected</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I can usually polish my left hand</li>
            <li> A LESSON LEARNED  I will NEVER order from Amazoln again and will pass on to other viewers how Amazon  rips customers off after they get Credit Card Information ?</li>
            <li> I ordered this product late on Thursday and received it the next day</li>
            <li> very flimsy packaging small plastic pieces broken off, still works, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Save your money; not worth 10 cents let alone 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> You will be sorry if you do and the only thing on it that will last or is of any use is the little fingernail polish holder.</li>
            <li> i was a little irritated about</li>
            <li> I adore this little toy.</li>
            <li> A little girl just had to have it, so I thought,</li>
            <li> ---unfortunately, I wasted my money this time.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money,  and I think I got a used one and</li>
            <li> It is a little clumsy to use</li>
            <li> From miles away you could predict this was a bad version of the real product.</li>
            <li> Maybe she was too small (her hands), but it just wasn&#x27;t what we thought it be or do.</li>
            <li> and she does them in half the time she used to!!</li>
            <li> it can be hard to get it out when the bottle is tilted otherwise</li>
            <li> I may not have understood how to use it, but how hard could it be ?</li>
            <li> Hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> The base has a plastic nail in the center that does not go all the way down, so the discs do not stay in place at all.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work flimsy assembly and overpriced for paper thin plastic.</li>
            <li> thin very thin plastic&lt;br /&gt;4).</li>
            <li> But I unfortunately didn&#x27;t receive the Polish Chair.</li>
            <li> My wife is almost blind</li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unable to get ahold of Customer Service ??</li>
            <li> This was for a pre-teen girl who had seen it on TV and wanted it desperately, so I got it for her.</li>
            <li> i would not purchase this item again.very unhappy with this product, i would not recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing for me to pay and order a product ad receive a bad one.</li>
            <li> It was very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this crap...</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and was very disappointed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Awful quality!</li>

            <li> Did not work as advertised.  Gave it to the Goodwill.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, wasn&#x27;t impressed at all</li>
            <li> Super Cheap!  Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> idea looks nice on ad.  But received final product was thin cheap plastic. Doesn&#x27;t work flimsy assembly and overpriced for paper thin plastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product late on Thursday and received it the next day and I didn&#x27;t pay anything extra for expedited shipping. I was very impressed as well as excited to use Nail Perfect.  Now for the product; it seems this product is a great idea on paper but to actually use it seemed a bit awkward. You have to paint one nail 2-3 coats all at once or you run the risk of smudging your handywork as you move on to do another nail and I think it takes alot longer to do this because you have to wait for each nail to dry between coats as opposed to painting 1 coat on each nail before applying a second coat.  Pulling out your nail from the nail disk proved to be a bit tricky but maybe with time and practice this trick can be mastered. Overall it&#x27;s an O.K. product and works better with longer nails (active length nails are harder to work with on Nail Perfect) and when all my nails were painted and dry, it did have a better end result.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and I had it in nearly no time.  It is made of \\&quot;melmac\\&quot; type plastic, so \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the first thing you think of when looking at it.  However, functionally, it is a great product and delivers the results promised.  I was looking for a way to save money on manicures, and this is it.  It helped me polish my own nails without getting polish onto my cuticles and skin.  I took it with me and polished my nails in the car while I waited to pick up my son from one of his activities.  It saves time and does the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who loves to paint her nails but always gets it all over her finger. This had made it so much easier for her. There a three disks. One for kids nail, one for adult/ teenager nails and one for toe nails. I don&#x27;t really thing I would you use this for my toe nails but I might. The nail polish chair is helpful but if your using a bottle of polish that&#x27;s almost empty it can be hard to get it out when the bottle is tilted otherwise the chair thing is great.Overall this is an amazing product. I was skeptical at first but I am so glad I got it. Since I have purchased more for family, friends, and perfect gifts.</li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift for my thirteen year old sister and she loves it.  she hates getting polish all aver her skin so this worked great.  one thing i was a little irritated about is when i went to wrap the gift it said 200+ nail decals so i decided to open it an look at them to make sure they were all age appropriate.  there was one tiny sheet of decals with about twenty decals on it.  the rest had been removed before being shipped.  very uncool!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it helps you put on polish without smudging. Great for when you are in a hurry or putting on red!&lt;br /&gt;Three disks with different size openings for different size nails. But I unfortunately didn&#x27;t receive the Polish Chair. No matter, it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> Useless, cheap and flimsy.  This is a good concept, but made very cheaply....don&#x27;t buy it.  You will be sorry if you do and the only thing on it that will last or is of any use is the little fingernail polish holder.</li>
            <li> VERY cheap and not like as seen on TV.</li>
            <li> I adore this little toy. It would seem that it would fit a teenie bopper, but also tickles my fancy (more mature lady). It does ease the job of keeping the painting of the nails straight. One has to practice a bit to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> My wife is almost blind so I bought this hoping it would help me when I did her nails.  It helped a little, but didn&#x27;t work that great. In fact she just got a professional manicure yesterday, so one more thing for the next garage sale.</li>

            <li> This is a great invention.  I can usually polish my left hand ok, but not my right hand.  This works terrific on both hands.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was for a pre-teen girl who had seen it on TV and wanted it desperately, so I got it for her.

            <li> I have fibromyalgia and thought this might help when I&#x27;m trying to do my nails (esp the right hand, as is most people&#x27;s problem).  I have recently gotten into doing nail art and developed a huge collection of nail accessories.  So far, the few times I have tried using this gadget, it has been no help at all and I have had an easier time without it---unfortunately, I wasted my money this time.</li>

            <li> This was a Christmas gift and I wish I could return it. Great idea put terrible design. No instructions, cheap materials. Save your money; not worth 10 cents let alone 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Sucks. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I should have know better...but of course...I just had to buy it.  Holding a finger in place waiting for a nail to dry....not my idea of getting my nails done faster and neater....you will be better off just doing them the regular way. This was really too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It was a very cheap looking product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. Used it 1 time and put it away. I may not have understood how to use it, but how hard could it be ?</li>
            <li> This might work if you are a male to female transexual or a girl with man hands. I was totally pissed off. This product BLOWS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not messy at all painting my left hand, but usually mess my right up because I don&#x27;t paint as well with my left. These really do the trick, just be careful cleaning them after. I use a Q-tip, it&#x27;s more work than a cotton ball or paper towel, but when I try to use those I end up taking the polish off the tip of the nails on the hand I use to do the cleaning.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a present for my wife. She loves it!! Her nails look beautiful&lt;br /&gt;and sexy and she does them in half the time she used to!!</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money. Bulky, takes up room, and only works okay. I&#x27;ve gone back to just wiping my nails with q-tips as I did before.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY CHEAP!  I don&#x27;t expect these to last very long. Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth 5 cents.&lt;br /&gt;1). No instructions&lt;br /&gt;2). The screw on top does not tighten all the way down to hold the disk in place.&lt;br /&gt;3). It is made of flimsy plastic...thin very thin plastic&lt;br /&gt;4). Made a huge mess because would not tighten.&lt;br /&gt;5). And did I mention Cheap....Cheap Cheap.</li>
            <li> No direction, copied graphics.  Still do not know how to open drawer.  But I have one!  A little girl just had to have it, so I thought, so now she has it.</li>
            <li> Thought would have  been a better product not as easy to use as they show gave to my younger daughter she plays with it !</li>
            <li> It is a little clumsy to use but otherwise it is okay.  it does help with polishing your nails though</li>
            <li> This product would be perfect for a child or a small person. I am neither. I am large with large fingers. There just was not enough choices for me.</li>
            <li> VERY DIS-SATISFIED  with this order ? I ordered &amp;#34;Hollywood Nails As Seen On TV&amp;#34; and received Nails&lt;br /&gt;Perfect As Seen On TV&amp;#34; Completlely Different Package ???  Unable to get ahold of Customer Service ??&lt;br /&gt;The product sent out was completely different than what was ordered ?? A LESSON LEARNED  I will NEVER order from Amazoln again and will pass on to other viewers how Amazon  rips customers off after they get Credit Card Information ? Amazons Rating Is &amp;#34;ZERO&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;lawrencefolk@yahoo.ca</li>
            <li> This strange little machine really works!</li>
            <li> I did not like this.  It is cheap and warbled as I tried to use it.  none of the grooves fit my nails as it promises to, and I returned the product to the seller.</li>
            <li> Awful quality! Do not buy it</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and was very disappointed when it arrived. The material was very cheap plastic and did not fit together very well at all. It was very awkward to use. directions were nowhere to be found. This product was cheap, flimsy, and not worth purchasing. I can not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this for more than $10. That it all that this product is worth! It is a flimsy little thing that doesn&#x27;t even come in a pretty box, or with instructions! I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this crap...</li>
            <li> Hard to use.  I gave it away.  Poor shapes to fit nails!</li>
            <li> This was just as they state on T.V.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, it came in a white box with a printed little sheet of the real version of this product. From miles away you could predict this was a bad version of the real product. It&#x27;s really disappointing for me to pay and order a product ad receive a bad one. The base has a plastic nail in the center that does not go all the way down, so the discs do not stay in place at all.  I don&#x27;t recommend this seller at all.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  This is a waste of money,  and I think I got a used one and the description said new.</li>
