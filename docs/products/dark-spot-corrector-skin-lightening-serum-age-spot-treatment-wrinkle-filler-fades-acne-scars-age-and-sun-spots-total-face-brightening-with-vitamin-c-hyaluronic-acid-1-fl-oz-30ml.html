            <li>My skin has more of a glow, and it feels more smooth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SELLER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>It is also fragrance free, so my skin is more receptive to it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and makes my skin feel tighter .  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference very quickly when I started using this product.</li>
            <li>A product I can easily give 10 stars to if I could.</li>
            <li>I love the way it absorbs quickly..</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to leaving my house with no foundation and feel comfortable in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will keep ordering my skin looks refresh and smooth</li>
            <li>and I can already feel such a great improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>Just received the product today tonight I used it it made my face feel so smooth since I just recieved it</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that this product is vegan, cruelty-free and fragrance free</li>
            <li>They asked her if her mother was available</li>
            <li>it seems like it doesn&#x27;t absorb and just sits right on top of my skin idk..</li>
            <li>You must clean your face twice a day even if it&#x27;s a light cleansing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie who is always trying out new products, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, have been using for a few weeks, skin feels great!</li>
            <li>When I first ordered the serum I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about it</li>
            <li>I am getting more and more confident with going out in public without makeup on (something I would never do before!)</li>
            <li>The seller was quick to respond to my questions and concerns before I purchased, and the product shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>I put the Vitamin C Brightening Serum on the burn and it seemed to significantly speed up the healing process.  </li>
            <li>I feel a lot more naturally pretty.</li>
            <li>It’s also not greasy – it absorbs really fast and feels very light.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim because they had a special offer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My skin definitely looks more smooth and a couple of darker spots have lightened!  </li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer from this point forward.</li>
            <li>Also, the product arrived quickly and they follow up with helpful tips</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Yesterday  I needed to run a quick errand</li>
            <li>This is the VERY FIRST review I have ever written.</li>
            <li>This is a great dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>It comes out easy and not too much 2 squirts does the job .</li>
            <li>I love the non-greasy feel, the non-stinging and the non-fragrance, but most of all I love that it plumps up my wrinkles and diminishes my dark spots – I am also very particular of the ingredients used.  </li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle of this amazing serum.</li>
            <li>but until recently Olay  stopped producing the amazing results I had grown accustomed too..  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading the amazing reviews and being fed up with a current breakout on my face.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews.  </li>
            <li>I learned that it is also good for first aid and wound healing, so I tried it out on a minor scrape on my son’s arm.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I put on at night with a light application of retin-A on top.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the way it made my face feel.i love this product</li>
            <li>I have a story for you I rarely drink .</li>
            <li>Today my daughter said I see u found the right Olay products again ..</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my results so far and would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I give it 3-stars because this will be the first time using it, hopefully by the time the bottle is finished I can say it&#x27;s worth 5-stars...</li>
            <li>My second bottle has already arrived and I can easily say, I will be a continuing customer of Lotus Flower and its products!</li>
            <li>But most importantly for me, it has greatly improved a few dark spots on my face that have been bothering me for a while.</li>
            <li>I know this post is pretty long but in summary in 2-3 day I had amazing results</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after finally giving this product a fair chance was the softness of my skin and how CLEAR the area around my nose and cheeks had gotten.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural product that would work for fine lines and hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>and it is really working!  </li>
            <li>Many people have actually commented on my skin and that I can pass for my 20s again!</li>
            <li>I do eat pretty well</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Lotus flower!</li>
            <li>skin definitely felt more hydrated after the steady use of the serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but so far I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>This one is alcohol free and does not dry my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I got email from Melissa, the owner, she recommended pure aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not only did the scrape heal quickly, but it didn’t even scar!  </li>
            <li>My whole face looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is gentle and has no adverse side effects</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This one is a pump bottle much nicer.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>I like that it does not feel greasy and really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I am not having to use as much</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, smoother and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I am very sceptical about skin products.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks Lotus Flower.</li>
            <li>My skin was very blotchy looking, but not now.</li>
            <li>and I have been searching for a skin product that would naturally smooth out my &amp;#34;life lines&amp;#34; and bring that youthful glow back to my skin!!!</li>
            <li>and my skin is much softer flowing ..</li>
            <li>This product is a real treasure.</li>
            <li>I tried it on a whim hearing so much about vitamin c</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and the bottle lasts a long time and the delivery was quick!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it, especially now at this time of the year, right between the fall and winter when my skin tend to become so dry, This serum saves me!</li>
            <li>This is the 5th bottle that I have purchased and I will continue to do so as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>My face was pretty clear to begin with in regards to acne.</li>
            <li>In just a month, I can honestly see a small difference already.</li>
            <li>but I needed to get rid of the pimples the small kind</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>PLEASE give this product a REAL try by using it day and night and using a full skin care regime a long with it.</li>
            <li>also love the label and packaging, it looks like fancy and expensive on my bathroom shelf :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise - My skin is more even, dark spots are lightening up,skin is brighter &amp; not a pimple in a week!</li>
            <li>( face had been dull and breaking out and Olay products were no longer effective for me</li>
            <li>When I started, I had some acne, which cleared up quicker than it normally would.  </li>
            <li>They go right away and haven&#x27;t left any marks after.</li>
            <li>and I just ordered a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I was an Olay Regenerist  Woman, but the serum now makes me break out and the new perfecting cream or</li>
            <li>Nope trying something new..  </li>
            <li>It is helpful for fine lines and dark spots</li>
            <li>Makes me skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It has diminished almost completely since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe the results so far!</li>
            <li>The breakouts that I have now are very few, and very teeny, like a pimple or two that isn&#x27;t HUGE.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much smoother and I noticed it fading dark spots as well as some redness right away.  </li>
            <li>Now I want to focus on keeping my skin clear and diminishing the acne scars.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as I feel it is beneficial and has not caused any type of irritation or reaction to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But so far, I like it</li>
            <li>It helped balance my skin out and brightened it up considerably</li>
            <li>It is very nourishing without being oily and I notice a difference overall on my face!!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks young and glowing</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it gives me a natural glow (not shiny)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients, so</li>
            <li>I thought I would try some Natural skin regimen..  </li>
            <li>However the true test came when I burned my neck slightly with the curling iron while styling my hair</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a severe burn but it certainly left a sizable red mark that looked very much like a hickey.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum to any woman who feels her skin could use some extra moisture.</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>As I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scents as well, I was a little concerned about using a new product, but have found it to be quite gentle with no noticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but there is less crows feet, and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later they are completely gone.</li>
            <li>they have  faded enough that I can now use a cover  stick and completely hide the spots.  </li>
            <li>I only want all natural ingredients.and</li>
            <li>they thought I was her older sister ..but not old enough to be her Guardian..</li>
            <li>Since I’ve started seeing wrinkles and dark spots, I’ve really been looking for a natural product that would actually work.  </li>
            <li>but I  normally have very  dry  </li>
            <li>Now I am really seeing the value of this product, not only for aging skin concerns, but for other uses as well.</li>
            <li>I have always spent a lot of money on my skin, especially as I’ve been getting older.  </li>
            <li>Have only used a couple times and has worked really well to lighten a couple of dark areas.</li>

            <li> When I added this serum to my facial cleansing routine I have been impressed.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and brighter for the most part.</li>
            <li> which is great for my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> What I can say so far is this product goes on easy and leaves my skin feeling wonderful and light.</li>

            <li> I love the way it absorbs quickly..</li>

            <li> I will keep ordering my skin looks refresh and smooth</li>
            <li> and I can already feel such a great improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> Just received the product today tonight I used it it made my face feel so smooth since I just recieved it</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that this product is vegan, cruelty-free and fragrance free</li>
            <li> They asked her if her mother was available</li>
            <li> it seems like it doesn&#x27;t absorb and just sits right on top of my skin idk..</li>
            <li> You must clean your face twice a day even if it&#x27;s a light cleansing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie who is always trying out new products, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, have been using for a few weeks, skin feels great!</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the serum I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about it</li>
            <li> I am getting more and more confident with going out in public without makeup on (something I would never do before!)</li>
            <li> The seller was quick to respond to my questions and concerns before I purchased, and the product shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li> I put the Vitamin C Brightening Serum on the burn and it seemed to significantly speed up the healing process.  </li>
            <li> I feel a lot more naturally pretty.</li>
            <li> It’s also not greasy – it absorbs really fast and feels very light.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because they had a special offer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely looks more smooth and a couple of darker spots have lightened!  </li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer from this point forward.</li>
            <li> Also, the product arrived quickly and they follow up with helpful tips</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Yesterday  I needed to run a quick errand</li>
            <li> This is the VERY FIRST review I have ever written.</li>
            <li> This is a great dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> It comes out easy and not too much 2 squirts does the job .</li>
            <li> I love the non-greasy feel, the non-stinging and the non-fragrance, but most of all I love that it plumps up my wrinkles and diminishes my dark spots – I am also very particular of the ingredients used.  </li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this amazing serum.</li>
            <li> but until recently Olay  stopped producing the amazing results I had grown accustomed too..  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the amazing reviews and being fed up with a current breakout on my face.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews.  </li>
            <li> I learned that it is also good for first aid and wound healing, so I tried it out on a minor scrape on my son’s arm.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I put on at night with a light application of retin-A on top.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the way it made my face feel.i love this product</li>
            <li> I have a story for you I rarely drink .</li>
            <li> Today my daughter said I see u found the right Olay products again ..</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my results so far and would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I give it 3-stars because this will be the first time using it, hopefully by the time the bottle is finished I can say it&#x27;s worth 5-stars...</li>
            <li> My second bottle has already arrived and I can easily say, I will be a continuing customer of Lotus Flower and its products!</li>
            <li> But most importantly for me, it has greatly improved a few dark spots on my face that have been bothering me for a while.</li>
            <li> I know this post is pretty long but in summary in 2-3 day I had amazing results</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after finally giving this product a fair chance was the softness of my skin and how CLEAR the area around my nose and cheeks had gotten.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product that would work for fine lines and hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> and it is really working!  </li>
            <li> Many people have actually commented on my skin and that I can pass for my 20s again!</li>
            <li> I do eat pretty well</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Lotus flower!</li>
            <li> skin definitely felt more hydrated after the steady use of the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but so far I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This one is alcohol free and does not dry my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I got email from Melissa, the owner, she recommended pure aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not only did the scrape heal quickly, but it didn’t even scar!  </li>
            <li> My whole face looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is gentle and has no adverse side effects</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This one is a pump bottle much nicer.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> I like that it does not feel greasy and really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not having to use as much</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, smoother and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I am very sceptical about skin products.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks Lotus Flower.</li>
            <li> My skin was very blotchy looking, but not now.</li>
            <li> and I have been searching for a skin product that would naturally smooth out my &amp;#34;life lines&amp;#34; and bring that youthful glow back to my skin!!!</li>
            <li> and my skin is much softer flowing ..</li>
            <li> This product is a real treasure.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a whim hearing so much about vitamin c</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and the bottle lasts a long time and the delivery was quick!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got it, especially now at this time of the year, right between the fall and winter when my skin tend to become so dry, This serum saves me!</li>
            <li> This is the 5th bottle that I have purchased and I will continue to do so as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> My face was pretty clear to begin with in regards to acne.</li>
            <li> In just a month, I can honestly see a small difference already.</li>
            <li> but I needed to get rid of the pimples the small kind</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> PLEASE give this product a REAL try by using it day and night and using a full skin care regime a long with it.</li>
            <li> also love the label and packaging, it looks like fancy and expensive on my bathroom shelf :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise - My skin is more even, dark spots are lightening up,skin is brighter &amp; not a pimple in a week!</li>
            <li> ( face had been dull and breaking out and Olay products were no longer effective for me</li>
            <li> When I started, I had some acne, which cleared up quicker than it normally would.  </li>
            <li> They go right away and haven&#x27;t left any marks after.</li>
            <li> and I just ordered a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I was an Olay Regenerist  Woman, but the serum now makes me break out and the new perfecting cream or</li>
            <li> Nope trying something new..  </li>
            <li> It is helpful for fine lines and dark spots</li>
            <li> Makes me skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It has diminished almost completely since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe the results so far!</li>
            <li> The breakouts that I have now are very few, and very teeny, like a pimple or two that isn&#x27;t HUGE.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much smoother and I noticed it fading dark spots as well as some redness right away.  </li>
            <li> Now I want to focus on keeping my skin clear and diminishing the acne scars.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as I feel it is beneficial and has not caused any type of irritation or reaction to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But so far, I like it</li>
            <li> It helped balance my skin out and brightened it up considerably</li>
            <li> It is very nourishing without being oily and I notice a difference overall on my face!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks young and glowing</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it gives me a natural glow (not shiny)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients, so</li>
            <li> I thought I would try some Natural skin regimen..  </li>
            <li> However the true test came when I burned my neck slightly with the curling iron while styling my hair</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a severe burn but it certainly left a sizable red mark that looked very much like a hickey.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum to any woman who feels her skin could use some extra moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scents as well, I was a little concerned about using a new product, but have found it to be quite gentle with no noticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but there is less crows feet, and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later they are completely gone.</li>
            <li> they have  faded enough that I can now use a cover  stick and completely hide the spots.  </li>
            <li> I only want all natural ingredients.and</li>
            <li> they thought I was her older sister ..but not old enough to be her Guardian..</li>
            <li> Since I’ve started seeing wrinkles and dark spots, I’ve really been looking for a natural product that would actually work.  </li>
            <li> but I  normally have very  dry  </li>
            <li> Now I am really seeing the value of this product, not only for aging skin concerns, but for other uses as well.</li>
            <li> I have always spent a lot of money on my skin, especially as I’ve been getting older.  </li>
            <li> Have only used a couple times and has worked really well to lighten a couple of dark areas.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot softer and my acne has gone down considerably!</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old afro american, and have always had acne prone skin, with dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> At 49 years old I started thinking about what the heck I was going to do about these wrinkles and dark spots I have been noticing on my face.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because my face gets really dry after using this.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t meet expectations, only made my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> so far it looks my my acne marks are fading a little I will be buying again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of much as far as visual results just yet, but I&#x27;m optimistic that those will come with time.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to talk about long term benefits.  </li>
            <li> I got my husband started on it as well because he has recently developed a few sun spots on his face that have been bothersome for him.</li>
            <li> I plan on using the anti-aging serum for a long time!</li>
            <li> Definetly earned my long time business!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long..</li>
            <li> I was meaning to ask you if everything was ok you had been looking tired lately.</li>
            <li> NOW, I still get minimal break outs, and my dark spots are still there and present, BUT the areas that aren&#x27;t in bad shape are BEYOND clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and no one ever believes that some usually say I look in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes and lips are starting to look less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, live in a dry climate and the last few years have suffered from acne.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried other serums that had alcohol in them and found that my skin would get dry and flake.  </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands trying to get my skin to a place of balance and health and</li>
            <li> The quality wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I had a few stress related acne scars that have started to lighten up by using this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I was fed up with my face looking so dull and tired all of the time.</li>
            <li> It is a delight to use and after 3 weeks my skin feels tighter and less dry.</li>
            <li> and I notice  that my skin seems less dry since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to anyone looking to try something different and bring a little glow to their skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and it only takes a few drops!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the past month as part of my nighttime beauty regimen and am definitely seeing results!</li>
            <li> I am using the product every other day @ night once after washing my face 2 squirts</li>
            <li> I am just working on getting the dark spots to fade.</li>
            <li> After using it after a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark spots on my face have lightened and that my face is tighter and is glowing.</li>
            <li> Also I have  dark spots on my face that I was thinking of having removed by laser but while the spots are still  visible,  </li>
            <li> I do hope it does get rid of some dark spots...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for a month now and the dark spots that I never thought would fade away</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter, my pores have shrunk and my dark spots have lightened.</li>
            <li> omg u gotta put that powder stuff on just to go down the street</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and ready for disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and I am noticing that I get it less often now and the post acne marks are diminished.  </li>
            <li> She says the discoloration of my skin is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> just seems less blotchy.</li>
            <li> Previous black head make are less noticeable ..</li>
            <li> I know have dark spots &amp; uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight when it goes on.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed my complexion is smoother and a little brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face, so I look forward to seeing what they look like a month from now!</li>
            <li> just a light layer of foundation is enough now that the base of my skin is brighter and smoother!</li>
            <li> but it was a few weeks out.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a few days, waiting for my skin to breakout or no change at all.  </li>
            <li> It seems like my skin doesn&#x27;t look as tired and that my pores are smaller as well.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not too sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I still struggle with a few bumps here and there</li>
            <li> I use this everyday...</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small for the price though.</li>
            <li> All of my dark spots have faded and I mean faded a lot for people to see a noticable diffrence.</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect</li>
            <li> I have had chronic skin problems for the past 10 years and I am turning 30 this year.</li>
            <li> Ive been suffering from breakouts in my late 30s for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Not magical</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look as dull and it seems brighter to me.</li>
            <li> Update, my daughter who is in her late 20&#x27;s is asking me what I am using on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> whatever it is called now is too thick ....</li>
            <li> The changes are subtle  </li>
            <li> Of course I shared my secret.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any break outs</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have to say after just a week I am noticing a difference.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THE SELLER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS FABULOUS. THE SERUM JUST DD NOT AGREE WITH MY SKIN TYPE. NOT SAYING AT ALL IT ISNT A GOOD PRODUCT. JUST NOT FOR ME!</li>
            <li> I just finished up my first bottle of the serum and LOVED it!  My skin definitely looks more smooth and a couple of darker spots have lightened!  My second bottle has already arrived and I can easily say, I will be a continuing customer of Lotus Flower and its products!</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 2 weeks now. I love the way it makes my skin feel!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because they had a special offer on Amazon.  I know Vitamin C serums are good for brightening skin.  I will be 53 in December and have no wrinkles.  Was not sure what to expect but I have to say after using it only 3-4 days (I apply at night before bed), I have noticed my complexion is smoother and a little brighter.  I will continue to use it as I feel it is beneficial and has not caused any type of irritation or reaction to my sensitive skin.  A good product to incorporate in your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 weeks now. I definitely see an immediate brightening to my skin tone when I put it on. I love it! I have dark spots on my face, so I look forward to seeing what they look like a month from now!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because my face gets really dry after using this. Otherwise, I like it and my boyfriend has said that my face does have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; now. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t meet expectations, only made my skin dry.  I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I must share my story! I rarely write reviews.  I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, live in a dry climate and the last few years have suffered from acne.  I know have dark spots &amp; uneven skin tone. At my last resort, I scheduled a dermatologist appt but it was a few weeks out.  In the meantime I did research, read reviews and gave this Vit C serum a try.  I got email from Melissa, the owner, she recommended pure aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil as a moisturizer. I was skeptical at first and ready for disappointment.  I gave it a few days, waiting for my skin to breakout or no change at all.  But to my surprise - My skin is more even, dark spots are lightening up,skin is brighter &amp; not a pimple in a week! Derm appt is now cancelled! If you have doubts, don&#x27;t!  You must try this!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in a month!  I am looking forward to leaving my house with no foundation and feel comfortable in my skin. Thank you Melissa!</li>
            <li> This is the VERY FIRST review I have ever written. I am 30 years old afro american, and have always had acne prone skin, with dark spots and blemishes. I have been using this product since September and I just ordered a new bottle. I have used EVERY topical cream, used every pill, used ProActiv, drug store drands, and brands on TV. Tons of money on prescriptions and co-pays, not to mention services not covered by insurance, chemical peels, and microderm. Literally a miracle in a bottle. NOW, I still get minimal break outs, and my dark spots are still there and present, BUT the areas that aren&#x27;t in bad shape are BEYOND clear and smooth. The first thing I noticed after finally giving this product a fair chance was the softness of my skin and how CLEAR the area around my nose and cheeks had gotten. My whole face looks refreshed. All of my dark spots have faded and I mean faded a lot for people to see a noticable diffrence. The breakouts that I have now are very few, and very teeny, like a pimple or two that isn&#x27;t HUGE. They go right away and haven&#x27;t left any marks after. My skin looks very healthy and even toned. I am just working on getting the dark spots to fade. PLEASE give this product a REAL try by using it day and night and using a full skin care regime a long with it. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in another month.</li>
            <li> Just started to use this product, so will know more as time goes by.  But so far, I like it and it agrees with my skin.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It is a delight to use and after 3 weeks my skin feels tighter and less dry.</li>
            <li> It helped balance my skin out and brightened it up considerably</li>
            <li> I love love love this serum! What a difference has made in my nightly routine. My skin is softer and it only takes a few drops! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like it and I think my complexion is brighter after using it. I also have been using clarisonic brush and toner so it could be a combination of all items.</li>
            <li> Too soon to talk about long term benefits.  However my skin feels and looks dewy (not greasy) and I have noticed some improvement in the texture.</li>
            <li> This is amazing I will keep ordering my skin looks refresh and smooth</li>
            <li> Have only used a couple times and has worked really well to lighten a couple of dark areas.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift, and my friend is delighted with the results. Her face is smoother and looks better, too.</li>
            <li> very nice product. My skin is tighter and smoother after I use it</li>
            <li> I love it.  It goes on easily and makes my skin feel tighter .  It is gentle and has no adverse side effects</li>
            <li> Love the product and the customer service from the seller! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a red spot on my face for months from a systic breakout that never emerged and just lingered and hurt for weeks. It left a scar like red spot on my cheek forever. It has diminished almost completely since I&#x27;ve been using this! I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is awesome! It has helped improve my over all skin tone and my face looks brighter since using it. But most importantly for me, it has greatly improved a few dark spots on my face that have been bothering me for a while. I got my husband started on it as well because he has recently developed a few sun spots on his face that have been bothersome for him. Since using he also has seen improvement. This is a great dark spot corrector. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this vitamin c and I can see my skin getting brighter and my spots reducing.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle. Same product as my last order but it was in a dropper bottle. This one is a pump bottle much nicer. Same serum same price</li>
            <li> Love it, but have not seen a difference.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is truly transforming my skin. I have had chronic skin problems for the past 10 years and I am turning 30 this year. I have spent thousands trying to get my skin to a place of balance and health and your serum has made a noticeable difference in just one month; my skin is clearer, softer, and more balanced. I think this product is wonderful and I am so grateful to have found it. I will be a loyal customer from this point forward.</li>
            <li> Nice, easy to use, makes a difference</li>
            <li> Used almost a month. No change</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I needed no adjustment peroid and has improved the appearace of my skin:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a short time, but my skin feels smoother.  As I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scents as well, I was a little concerned about using a new product, but have found it to be quite gentle with no noticeable fragrance.  I&#x27;m not sure of much as far as visual results just yet, but I&#x27;m optimistic that those will come with time.  Peggy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good serum. After I apply it, I use my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product that would work for fine lines and hormonal acne. This serum has done wonders for my skin!! I have got so many compliments about how my skin glows, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried combining the vitamin C serum with Retin-A. I used Retin-A at night and vitamin C in the morning and the combination works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the label and packaging, it looks like fancy and expensive on my bathroom shelf :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this serum for 3 months now and I have happy skin.  It is helpful for fine lines and dark spots and I&#x27;m noticing those starting to fade. It is very nourishing without being oily and I notice a difference overall on my face!!!!!</li>
            <li> The quality wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks, in the morning and evening.  When I started, I had some acne, which cleared up quicker than it normally would.  I really appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free.  It is also fragrance free, so my skin is more receptive to it.  I plan on using the anti-aging serum for a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I had a few stress related acne scars that have started to lighten up by using this product. I like that it does not feel greasy and really absorbs into the skin. This is the 5th bottle that I have purchased and I will continue to do so as long as it is available. I am a product junkie who is always trying out new products, but this is my favorite! I also like the information given about what to expect when using this serum, and how to achieve healthy skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I have always spent a lot of money on my skin, especially as I’ve been getting older.  Since I’ve started seeing wrinkles and dark spots, I’ve really been looking for a natural product that would actually work.  I’ve been using this serum for about a month now and it is really working!  My skin feels really soft and hydrated.  I like that it has natural and organic ingredients.  I’ve tried other serums that had alcohol in them and found that my skin would get dry and flake.  This one is alcohol free and does not dry my skin at all.  It’s also not greasy – it absorbs really fast and feels very light.  The wrinkles around my eyes and lips are starting to look less noticeable.  I occasionally get acne and I am noticing that I get it less often now and the post acne marks are diminished.  Also, the product arrived quickly and they follow up with helpful tips so you can understand  how to achieve good results.  I learned that it is also good for first aid and wound healing, so I tried it out on a minor scrape on my son’s arm.  Not only did the scrape heal quickly, but it didn’t even scar!  Now I am really seeing the value of this product, not only for aging skin concerns, but for other uses as well. I am very happy with my results so far and would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Shipped quickly and the product makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Great product, will order again.</li>
            <li> Screw top bottle has no tamper seal which means I cannot be sure of contents.  Nonetheless, I tried the serum and did not like the sticky feel at all after applying.</li>
            <li> Love it amazing product</li>
            <li> If you have had a laser resurfacing on your face as I did and have track marks or burns as I do try this product.  I have tried everything on the market from skin bleach, retin-A to Nerium.  This is the only product I put on at night with a light application of retin-A on top.  After 1 week I am seeing a difference in skin tone and the size of my pores.  I am not having to use as much make up to hide the discoloration of my skin.  Love this product.  Hope this helps.    Update, my daughter who is in her late 20&#x27;s is asking me what I am using on my face.  She says the discoloration of my skin is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the serum I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about it (I&#x27;m more of a CVS brand moisturizer kind of gal), but I have to say that I LOVE it. I have been using it for about a month now and my skin is just a lot smoother (my fiancee can vouch for this...he said something without having any idea I was doing anything different). I also noticed that the serum has helped a lot with the quality of my skin tone...just seems less blotchy. I would recommend this item to anyone looking to try something different and bring a little glow to their skin!</li>
            <li> Ive been suffering from breakouts in my late 30s for the past few years. I&#x27;ve tried every home remedy and acne wash out there... Within TWO days of using this serum they started clearing up. Two weeks later they are completely gone. My skin is brighter, smoother and looks so much healthier. I will use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have to say after just a week I am noticing a difference. Not magical but there is less crows feet, and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the past month as part of my nighttime beauty regimen and am definitely seeing results! I originally bought this because I was fed up with my face looking so dull and tired all of the time. In just a month, I can honestly see a small difference already. My face doesn&#x27;t look as dull and it seems brighter to me. I am getting more and more confident with going out in public without makeup on (something I would never do before!) I cannot wait to see how this product continues to improve the look of my face! Definitely worth buying!!</li>
            <li> I like the way it is working for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. Skin feels tight when it goes on. Also, skin is noticeably brighter. Can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like a month from now. Don&#x27;t forget to apply to your neck too</li>
            <li> My skin loves this and so do I. My skin looks young and glowing</li>
            <li> I just started using it and will see what it can do in a months time!</li>
            <li> Love it! Arrived quickly, have been using for a few weeks, skin feels great! Will likely order again!</li>
            <li> almost &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; noticeable  tightening and fine lines &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum. After using it after a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark spots on my face have lightened and that my face is tighter and is glowing. Many people have actually commented on my skin and that I can pass for my 20s again! It seems like my skin doesn&#x27;t look as tired and that my pores are smaller as well. I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing again! I haven&#x27;t tried other vitamin C serums out there yet, but since this is working so well for me (and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin in adult acne), I&#x27;m going to stick with it since it works so well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about three weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  I bought it because of all the wonderful reviews so I&#x27;m still going to use it and give it some time to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a couple of weeks but the results are amazing!! Would highly recommend this to anyone. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my face at all.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Use this after microneedling my face and it tightens and feels great.... The bottle is a little small for the price though.</li>
            <li> Makes me skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Still trying to see if it works</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this product. There is not sticky build up or residue and make-up glides on.</li>
            <li> I am very sceptical about skin products.  So many  make so many promises that don&#x27;t pan out.  But I have to say I have  definitely noticed a difference in my skin since I have  been  using this serum.  The changes are subtle  but I  normally have very  dry  skin  and I notice  that my skin seems less dry since I have been using this.  Also I have  dark spots on my face that I was thinking of having removed by laser but while the spots are still  visible,  they have  faded enough that I can now use a cover  stick and completely hide the spots.  I definitely could not do that before.  I will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks and I can already see the changes in my skin texture once I use moisturizer as the bottle suggests ..I give it 3-stars because this will be the first time using it, hopefully by the time the bottle is finished I can say it&#x27;s worth 5-stars...</li>
            <li> I started using this serum only a week ago and I can already feel such a great improvement in my skin texture. My skin feels so nice and smooth, I love it! I&#x27;m so glad I got it, especially now at this time of the year, right between the fall and winter when my skin tend to become so dry, This serum saves me! it׳s a keeper. It also arrived really fast. I highly recommend this serum to any woman who feels her skin could use some extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Just received the product today tonight I used it it made my face feel so smooth since I just recieved it I will update status later. I bought it because of acne marks and breakouts if it helps with that I will update with 4 stars instead. So far I like the way it made my face feel.i love this product so far it looks my my acne marks are fading a little I will be buying again</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this amazing serum. I noticed a difference very quickly when I started using this product. My face is brighter and the areas of discoloration have faded. In fact a friend that I had not seen in awhile asked me if I had been using Botox! Loved it. I use a derma roller several times a week but I apply the serum followed by a moisturizer nightly.</li>
            <li> I am using this and it does make my skin feel tighter. I haven&#x27;t used it very long..I do hope it does get rid of some dark spots...keep my fingers crossed. ..</li>
            <li> At 49 years old I started thinking about what the heck I was going to do about these wrinkles and dark spots I have been noticing on my face.  I wanted something that didn’t require needles and WA-LA…I found it!  Lotus Flower Vitamin C Serum.  I love the non-greasy feel, the non-stinging and the non-fragrance, but most of all I love that it plumps up my wrinkles and diminishes my dark spots – I am also very particular of the ingredients used.  I only want all natural ingredients.and I never support animal testing.  This product satisfies all of my needs.  Oh yeah, and the bottle lasts a long time and the delivery was quick!  Love that too.  Thanks Lotus Flower.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c brightening serum is wonderful! A product I can easily give 10 stars to if I could. I&#x27;ve only had the serum for 2 days, and I&#x27;ve been using it with a moisturizer (hope in a jar) and I can&#x27;t believe the results so far! My skin was very blotchy looking, but not now. In only two days the blotchy looking skin has smoothed out. Looks so much better!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;s going to look like in two weeks, even thirty days!! AWESOME! Will be getting more!</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin serum! I am a woman in my late 40&#x27;s and I have been searching for a skin product that would naturally smooth out my &amp;#34;life lines&amp;#34; and bring that youthful glow back to my skin!!! I finally found it! The seller was quick to respond to my questions and concerns before I purchased, and the product shipped quickly!  I also appreciate that this product is vegan, cruelty-free and fragrance free which is great for my sensitive skin!!! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because I just started using the product, so to claim anything one way or another would be premature. What I can say so far is this product goes on easy and leaves my skin feeling wonderful and light. I feel like it gives me a natural glow (not shiny) and it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients, so I love that. I would suggest this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It comes out easy and not too much 2 squirts does the job . I put it on after I wash my face while it&#x27;s still moist and I wait until it dries. 5-7 minutes Later I add my moisturizer and make up if I am leaving the house. I have oily acne prone skin. I did not break out . I have used it once a day for 3 day and my face is softer smoother and dewy. The seller is amazing . Quick delivery and she emails you tips on how to effectively use the product . She made some suggestions for an affordable and effective moisturizer aloe Vera and I think argan oil . I am going to try next week.. I will provide an update in two weeks. I am looking for reduced pores and that dewy well rested refreshed look ..  It said something about wrinkles and aging too so I am will check to see if my skin is firmer in two weeks . This serum tightens  you skin immediately after drying .. Also, it is not too sticky or too heavy. I love the way it absorbs quickly.. I was an Olay Regenerist  Woman, but the serum now makes me break out and the new perfecting cream or whatever it is called now is too thick ....it seems like it doesn&#x27;t absorb and just sits right on top of my skin idk.. I thought I would try some Natural skin regimen..  I use proactive as well but in cycles. I used olay like for 5 years . Then I tried a Mary Kay product called timewise but the gel made me break out and the day time moisturizer was ok but the nighttime one broke me out so I went back 2 Olay..  Oh let me give you some background information about me. I am 45 years old and no one ever believes that some usually say I look in my 20&#x27;s. I have a story for you I rarely drink . My family took me out for my bday and I wanted to try a  mojito.. I had to go back to the car and get my purse out the trunk because they wanted my ID. Also My daughter was 17 we went to the OB and We were in the waiting room .. They asked her if her mother was available they thought I was her older sister ..but not old enough to be her Guardian.. I do eat pretty well and I exercise but until recently Olay  stopped producing the amazing results I had grown accustomed too..  I Stopped using Olay products for 3 weeks the compliments I use to get about my skin and its flow ceased  u .. However I have good news. Yesterday  I needed to run a quick errand my hubby was like omg u gotta put that powder stuff on just to go down the street .. I did not put any make up on my face just liner and lip balm .. Today my daughter said I see u found the right Olay products again .. ( face had been dull and breaking out and Olay products were no longer effective for me tried them all)  told her Nope trying something new..  When I broke out I ordered proactive again the acne went away and I stopped using Olay... after I stopped using Olay I didn&#x27;t breakout anymore but I needed to get rid of the pimples the small kind but like a heat rash .. I had 2 blackheads and they caused scaring I will Let u know in two weeks if they brighten .. So I will see you in two weeks☺️.  I know this post is pretty long but in summary in 2-3 day I had amazing results I just edited this post because my neighbor said to me this evening &amp;#34; oh I see you are glowing again. I was meaning to ask you if everything was ok you had been looking tired lately. &amp;#34; her daughter said your skin looks amazing what are you using .. Of course I shared my secret. 😉  07.23 I am using the product every other day @ night once after washing my face 2 squirts and my skin is much softer flowing .. Previous black head make are less noticeable .. I have not experienced any break outs</li>
            <li> feels nice looking forward to results</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night.  My skin felt much smoother and I noticed it fading dark spots as well as some redness right away.  However the true test came when I burned my neck slightly with the curling iron while styling my hair (come on ladies, I can&#x27;t be the only one, LOL) It wasn&#x27;t a severe burn but it certainly left a sizable red mark that looked very much like a hickey.  GROSS!  I put the Vitamin C Brightening Serum on the burn and it seemed to significantly speed up the healing process.  My husband is now using it.  We LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this! I&#x27;ve used this serum for a month now and the dark spots that I never thought would fade away have started to noticeably go away! My skin is a lot softer and my acne has gone down considerably! I don&#x27;t have to pack my makeup on anymore, just a light layer of foundation is enough now that the base of my skin is brighter and smoother! I feel a lot more naturally pretty. This product is a real treasure. The delivery was the fastest I&#x27;ve experienced and the customer service was great! Definetly earned my long time business! Thanks Lotus flower!</li>
            <li> Tighten and lifts skin, de-puffs eyes.  One of the best serums I&#x27;ve tried.  Will definitely buy again and continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I tried it on a whim hearing so much about vitamin c and it&#x27;s skin benefits. I eat a plant based diet so I know I get enough vitamin c intake. When I added this serum to my facial cleansing routine I have been impressed. My skin is tighter, my pores have shrunk and my dark spots have lightened. I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and Caucasian. Its been about four weeks so I&#x27;m looking forward to further benefits. This product is reasonably priced and lasts a long time. Try it! You will be impressed! You must clean your face twice a day even if it&#x27;s a light cleansing in the morning. I use the serum at night; Works best for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the amazing reviews and being fed up with a current breakout on my face.  I now have been using this (and Retin-A)for about 8 weeks now. My skin is clearer and brighter for the most part. I still struggle with a few bumps here and there but nothing like before. I&#x27;ve received a couple compliments on my skin. Now I want to focus on keeping my skin clear and diminishing the acne scars. Hopefully after continued use the breakouts will be slim to none and my scars faded away. We shall see!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday...I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but so far I LOVE IT!!! My skin has more of a glow, and it feels more smooth.</li>
            <li> nice product... skin definitely felt more hydrated after the steady use of the serum.</li>
            <li> My face was pretty clear to begin with in regards to acne. I have a blotchy red complection though. Have used the product for over a week and I&#x27;ve several pimples come up now. This product is not for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Good for exfoliation and brightness of skin!</li>
