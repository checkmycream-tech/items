            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>soap acts as a potent degreasing agent.</li>
            <li>This soap is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it reminds me of camping when i was a kid.  </li>
            <li>I love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Many ticks here in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>my rule of thumb is that i can not use a soap whose ingredients have more than three syllables, unless of course we are talking about scientific names of plants.  </li>
            <li>the years I have given this soap to many people, men and women and they all have been converts.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for five years  and love everything about it, including the smell.</li>
            <li>I have reordered this product many times.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Also has a potent campfire/woodsy scent to it, which transforms your bathroom into a pseudo camping experience.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for our dry skin as well as good to shampoo.</li>
            <li>I always feel very clean and refreshed after showering with this.</li>
            <li>the best ever for dry skin</li>
            <li>Anyway, it keeps me clean and fresh, works well as a shampoo (yes the bar soap) and does a great job keeping my beard clean.  </li>
            <li>and I can happily say my PUPPP has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>This soap is the most cleansing, clearing without drying and comfortable soap.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the clean feeling when using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong when lathered up and applied though.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell (as in, you will smell it walking into your bathroom), but that strength doesn&#x27;t stay with you after you use it.</li>
            <li>The soap itself has a strong smell, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong sent on your body.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong at first (campfire and pine), but it quickly fades to a light pleasant woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>I love the soap as it does what it says, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed and helps smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes you smell like you just wrestled a bear and if your itchy from the rustling it fixes it quick!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell great, but not from several feet away like a strong cologne or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I am now free of any symptoms but this soap was just part of a regime of supplements and diet.</li>
            <li>Even the hypoallergenic soaps available at the grocery store seem to make my skin react.  </li>
            <li>Great for a Manly smell and for facial hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes me wonder what was in store-bought soap to be this effective in comparison..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, we received our order a couple of days ago, he used it a couple of times and so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, really has a clean feel.  </li>
            <li>Feel very clean and fresh when one takes a shower and uses this soap.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and the trial !</li>
            <li>how clean you feel and the soap smell</li>
            <li>The phrase squeaky clean comes to mind.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get used to the scent but it leaves your skin clean and squeaky.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product for beards and people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Gets you really clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin requires a mild, hypoallergenic, but effective soap.  </li>
            <li>This helped me when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I started using this soap early in the year and noticed such an incredible difference in my skin after just one use.</li>
            <li>Psoriasis cannot be cured, but it can be kept under control with different methods and this is definitely one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Pine Tar works really good for people with Dry Skin and Psoriasis as well.</li>
            <li>It helps keep the psoriasis calm.  </li>
            <li>great for peeling dead skin</li>
            <li>this soap has a not so nice smell only when you are using it</li>
            <li>My 4 and 5 year old kids like it too, mostly of color</li>
            <li>It smells like a campfire, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It works for my beard, rarely itches now.</li>
            <li>Nice lather, reduces my facial dermatitis and dandruff too.</li>
            <li>Love this product, all natural</li>
            <li>Overall, a good soap and the pack of 6 sold by Amazon.com is a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li>So no, you will not smell like freshly laid asphalt after showing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>My husband ordered me some right away.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, and our kids say it has helped with acne as well.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery of product.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, not strong.  </li>
            <li>We ordered a dozen more so that she could use it for the entire duration of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This brand has been my first choice for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Many fragrances and soaps can have chemicals that will affect our hormones, such as xeno-estrogens.  </li>
            <li>First off, the smell does get weaker the longer</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li>I started because after my first pregnancy, I got eczema on my face, and it can still come and go with hormone changes.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many people and they have found the same, that the smell gets lighter with use.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be buying the six pack if i hadn&#x27;t already tried the product and found it to be exactly what i need.  </li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders, or zinc shampoo works ok for me but only about three showers in a row.  </li>
            <li>It has been 9 days since I first used Grandpas Pine Tar Soap</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it all over my entire body, hair included.</li>
            <li>To me this soap smells to very close to freshly laid asphalt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me pretty</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right folks, it&#x27;s so good that standard English wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and I had to make up a word!</li>
            <li>Old time products are better than new stuff.</li>
            <li>Great soap, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>feels VERY clean the entire day.</li>
            <li>Leaves  your skin and hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It actually cleans surprisingly well and has NO xeno-estrogens, which no one wants but especially us men.  </li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and my skin goes through these &amp;#34;cycles&amp;#34; where it will be okay in the summer and really dry and patchy in the winter.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I really like the pine tar smell, reminds me of a simpler time when men were men, (in my imagination), and of camping.  </li>
            <li>then you should really try this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy trying out different soaps.</li>
            <li>It grew on me and now I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle on our skin too.</li>
            <li>&amp; it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It smells like tar and a real Christmas tree.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.</li>
            <li>You can use it for your whole body and when you are done you can use it to shave your face.</li>
            <li>I now use it to wash my whole body and hair.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than the local Natural Food stores</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad we did, within 1 week we could tell a significant difference, within a month, hardly any noticible eczema...</li>
            <li>The bulk-package pricing beat my other brick or mail-order sources by 30% or more.  </li>
            <li>Rinses off better than any other.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap to clean my beard initially, however, I&#x27;ve found that I like using it al over.</li>
            <li>My whole family used it up quick, will order multiple packs soon.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it is not very strong to me.</li>
            <li>I think 6 or 8, to get a decent deal.</li>
            <li>I still have 3 more bars left before I have to cross that bridge.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li>I use with a scrub brush and it has helped me clear up my back tremendously.</li>
            <li>The larger bars last longer but won&#x27;t fit in a soap dish for traveling.</li>
            <li>Soap so far is working for me!</li>
            <li>A few thin slices on your breakfast pancakes and your innards are clean for a month but don&#x27;t try that at home folks the smell is like napalm on the morning but is great at the same time you gonna&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other soaps.</li>
            <li>It can be used to wash hair but like most soaps, I find it hard to rinse completely out.</li>
            <li>My skin has started to clear up</li>
            <li>3 days into the process of taking 3-4 baths with this soap, itching was completely gone and 7 days no rashes were visible.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strange at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>I have used it for at least a decade, did I mention I love the smell?</li>
            <li>The smell is reminiscent of a campfire, which as another review stated gives it a very manly smell.</li>
            <li>It has what i would call a masculine scent, woodsy, not flowery.  </li>
            <li>If you have psoriasis or sensitive skin i would recommend giving this soap a shot.  </li>
            <li>In combination with removing a few food triggers from my diet i have been able to clear my skin almost entirely.</li>
            <li>We have tried every lotion, soap, salve, cream, old wive&#x27;s tail that you can imagine...</li>
            <li>By the way, I used to work on a road paving crew and I would not go so far as to equate the smell with asphalt.</li>
            <li>Nothing can clear it completely.  </li>
            <li>While the price is a bit much, and the lather is more of an off-white than a true white, and while it does smell pretty bad out of the box, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having to use it on my face was a little weird at first with the smell being so strong, but the more it was exposed to the water and air</li>
            <li>it were slightly cheaper, I&#x27;d bump this to a full five stars.</li>
            <li>I can live with the smell and the off-white lather because they don&#x27;t really matter once you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your body after leaving the shower and can be contained if the bar is kept in a plastic soap box (which I would recommend regardless to make it last as much as possible).</li>
            <li>Then I need to switch to a normal shampoo then back.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of being in a pine forest on a hot summer day, or a single malt scotch whisky such as Talisker.</li>
            <li>no dry skin in the winter for me!</li>
            <li>When I showed her the results just from using this soap she was absolutely amazed and is going to pass the word onto other women with PUPPP.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any skin issues (other than getting older</li>
            <li>Also the soap smells strong but after you dry off there is hardly any smell left on your skin .</li>
            <li>Being so heavily pregnant is hard enough without having to deal with the rash from hell.</li>
            <li>The bar seems to last longer than normal soap, I think due to how well this product lathers up.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> nice soap.</li>
            <li> Nice soap.</li>
            <li> It softens, cleans great, super sudsy,  and the smell is like a campfire on a warm summer evening.  </li>
            <li> Seller had the best price, was super prompt, and, unlike the seller I tried to get the body wash from,  filled my order.</li>
            <li> Very surprised, and happy!</li>
            <li> The bar itself smells VERY strong.  </li>

            <li> We love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> ($21 something) which was better than $6-7/each.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> soap acts as a potent degreasing agent.</li>
            <li> This soap is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it reminds me of camping when i was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Many ticks here in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> my rule of thumb is that i can not use a soap whose ingredients have more than three syllables, unless of course we are talking about scientific names of plants.  </li>
            <li> the years I have given this soap to many people, men and women and they all have been converts.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for five years  and love everything about it, including the smell.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product many times.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Also has a potent campfire/woodsy scent to it, which transforms your bathroom into a pseudo camping experience.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for our dry skin as well as good to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I always feel very clean and refreshed after showering with this.</li>
            <li> the best ever for dry skin</li>
            <li> Anyway, it keeps me clean and fresh, works well as a shampoo (yes the bar soap) and does a great job keeping my beard clean.  </li>
            <li> and I can happily say my PUPPP has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> This soap is the most cleansing, clearing without drying and comfortable soap.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the clean feeling when using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong when lathered up and applied though.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell (as in, you will smell it walking into your bathroom), but that strength doesn&#x27;t stay with you after you use it.</li>
            <li> The soap itself has a strong smell, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong sent on your body.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong at first (campfire and pine), but it quickly fades to a light pleasant woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> I love the soap as it does what it says, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed and helps smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like you just wrestled a bear and if your itchy from the rustling it fixes it quick!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell great, but not from several feet away like a strong cologne or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I am now free of any symptoms but this soap was just part of a regime of supplements and diet.</li>
            <li> Even the hypoallergenic soaps available at the grocery store seem to make my skin react.  </li>
            <li> Great for a Manly smell and for facial hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes me wonder what was in store-bought soap to be this effective in comparison..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, we received our order a couple of days ago, he used it a couple of times and so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, really has a clean feel.  </li>
            <li> Feel very clean and fresh when one takes a shower and uses this soap.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and the trial !</li>
            <li> how clean you feel and the soap smell</li>
            <li> The phrase squeaky clean comes to mind.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get used to the scent but it leaves your skin clean and squeaky.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product for beards and people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gets you really clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin requires a mild, hypoallergenic, but effective soap.  </li>
            <li> This helped me when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap early in the year and noticed such an incredible difference in my skin after just one use.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis cannot be cured, but it can be kept under control with different methods and this is definitely one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Pine Tar works really good for people with Dry Skin and Psoriasis as well.</li>
            <li> It helps keep the psoriasis calm.  </li>
            <li> great for peeling dead skin</li>
            <li> this soap has a not so nice smell only when you are using it</li>
            <li> My 4 and 5 year old kids like it too, mostly of color</li>
            <li> It smells like a campfire, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It works for my beard, rarely itches now.</li>
            <li> Nice lather, reduces my facial dermatitis and dandruff too.</li>
            <li> Love this product, all natural</li>
            <li> Overall, a good soap and the pack of 6 sold by Amazon.com is a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> So no, you will not smell like freshly laid asphalt after showing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered me some right away.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, and our kids say it has helped with acne as well.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery of product.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, not strong.  </li>
            <li> We ordered a dozen more so that she could use it for the entire duration of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This brand has been my first choice for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Many fragrances and soaps can have chemicals that will affect our hormones, such as xeno-estrogens.  </li>
            <li> First off, the smell does get weaker the longer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I started because after my first pregnancy, I got eczema on my face, and it can still come and go with hormone changes.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to many people and they have found the same, that the smell gets lighter with use.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be buying the six pack if i hadn&#x27;t already tried the product and found it to be exactly what i need.  </li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders, or zinc shampoo works ok for me but only about three showers in a row.  </li>
            <li> It has been 9 days since I first used Grandpas Pine Tar Soap</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it all over my entire body, hair included.</li>
            <li> To me this soap smells to very close to freshly laid asphalt.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me pretty</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right folks, it&#x27;s so good that standard English wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and I had to make up a word!</li>
            <li> Old time products are better than new stuff.</li>
            <li> Great soap, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> feels VERY clean the entire day.</li>
            <li> Leaves  your skin and hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It actually cleans surprisingly well and has NO xeno-estrogens, which no one wants but especially us men.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my skin goes through these &amp;#34;cycles&amp;#34; where it will be okay in the summer and really dry and patchy in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I really like the pine tar smell, reminds me of a simpler time when men were men, (in my imagination), and of camping.  </li>
            <li> then you should really try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy trying out different soaps.</li>
            <li> It grew on me and now I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle on our skin too.</li>
            <li> &amp; it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It smells like tar and a real Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.</li>
            <li> You can use it for your whole body and when you are done you can use it to shave your face.</li>
            <li> I now use it to wash my whole body and hair.</li>
            <li> The price was much better than the local Natural Food stores</li>
            <li> SOOOO glad we did, within 1 week we could tell a significant difference, within a month, hardly any noticible eczema...</li>
            <li> The bulk-package pricing beat my other brick or mail-order sources by 30% or more.  </li>
            <li> Rinses off better than any other.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to clean my beard initially, however, I&#x27;ve found that I like using it al over.</li>
            <li> My whole family used it up quick, will order multiple packs soon.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it is not very strong to me.</li>
            <li> I think 6 or 8, to get a decent deal.</li>
            <li> I still have 3 more bars left before I have to cross that bridge.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> I use with a scrub brush and it has helped me clear up my back tremendously.</li>
            <li> The larger bars last longer but won&#x27;t fit in a soap dish for traveling.</li>
            <li> Soap so far is working for me!</li>
            <li> A few thin slices on your breakfast pancakes and your innards are clean for a month but don&#x27;t try that at home folks the smell is like napalm on the morning but is great at the same time you gonna&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other soaps.</li>
            <li> It can be used to wash hair but like most soaps, I find it hard to rinse completely out.</li>
            <li> My skin has started to clear up</li>
            <li> 3 days into the process of taking 3-4 baths with this soap, itching was completely gone and 7 days no rashes were visible.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strange at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for at least a decade, did I mention I love the smell?</li>
            <li> The smell is reminiscent of a campfire, which as another review stated gives it a very manly smell.</li>
            <li> It has what i would call a masculine scent, woodsy, not flowery.  </li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis or sensitive skin i would recommend giving this soap a shot.  </li>
            <li> In combination with removing a few food triggers from my diet i have been able to clear my skin almost entirely.</li>
            <li> We have tried every lotion, soap, salve, cream, old wive&#x27;s tail that you can imagine...</li>
            <li> By the way, I used to work on a road paving crew and I would not go so far as to equate the smell with asphalt.</li>
            <li> Nothing can clear it completely.  </li>
            <li> While the price is a bit much, and the lather is more of an off-white than a true white, and while it does smell pretty bad out of the box, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having to use it on my face was a little weird at first with the smell being so strong, but the more it was exposed to the water and air</li>
            <li> it were slightly cheaper, I&#x27;d bump this to a full five stars.</li>
            <li> I can live with the smell and the off-white lather because they don&#x27;t really matter once you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your body after leaving the shower and can be contained if the bar is kept in a plastic soap box (which I would recommend regardless to make it last as much as possible).</li>
            <li> Then I need to switch to a normal shampoo then back.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of being in a pine forest on a hot summer day, or a single malt scotch whisky such as Talisker.</li>
            <li> no dry skin in the winter for me!</li>
            <li> When I showed her the results just from using this soap she was absolutely amazed and is going to pass the word onto other women with PUPPP.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any skin issues (other than getting older</li>
            <li> Also the soap smells strong but after you dry off there is hardly any smell left on your skin .</li>
            <li> Being so heavily pregnant is hard enough without having to deal with the rash from hell.</li>
            <li> The bar seems to last longer than normal soap, I think due to how well this product lathers up.</li>
            <li> The smell does last that long</li>
            <li> It works great in cold water, hard water, river water, rain water caught on a tarp.</li>
            <li> I came across this one while searching for a soap that wouldn&#x27;t further dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with my dry skin problem.  </li>
            <li> I had barely slept in over a week and my skin was red raw all over from scratching when a Google search led me to this soap as a possible cure.</li>
            <li> My mother credits it for her hair not going grey!</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry as it generally does.</li>
            <li> but has not scent after you dry off.</li>
            <li> My wife has now been using my Pine Tar Soap for almost a year and it helps her Dry Skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to have moderately dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Dry patches on my knees and elbows that I have had for years went away--something I was not expecting or even looking for in the soap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry.</li>
            <li> Dry scalp gone, acne gone, itchy skin gone.</li>
            <li> Even the women who may not particularly like the piney smell, say it is wondefrul for their hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;SMells aweful going on, like a wet bon-fire,</li>
            <li> It never really got rid of my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer from small dry patches or skin bumps, not really pimples.</li>
            <li> Smell weird first .  </li>
            <li> Grandpa&#x27;s soap helps both problems and is not drying like other soaps.</li>
            <li> wont use any other soap</li>
            <li> It seems to help with summertime itching due bug bites, pollen, seasonal allergies (except to pine trees -- why risk it), etc.  </li>
            <li> My family uses this soap and the other products every day.</li>
            <li> Very few simple ingredients that work.  </li>
            <li> Still use other products for that but much less (about twice a month instead of every other day).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find at local stores, but can find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My only complaint on it would have to be the cost of it.</li>
            <li> With each passing day the itching got less and less and the rash looked far less red and angry.</li>
            <li> However, even with that other soaps become a mushy mess at the end.</li>
            <li> it calmed down a bit.</li>
            <li> I then went down to 2 showers a day and am now down to 1.</li>
            <li> This one just shrinks down and fades away.</li>
            <li> I mean you can help yourself to using as regular soap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I like about this soap is it does not become a mushy mess at the end of its life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man&#x27;s man and don&#x27;t mess around with fancy lotions and soaps and all that stuff.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I came down with a severe case of PUPPP.</li>
            <li> I also notice less waste than with the bottled body wash.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer or was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Might leave a little stain in the shower (nothing that wouldn&#x27;t come out with the shower head).</li>
            <li> It seems to act as a bug repellant, helps with poison ivy, and it also helps with forms of dermatitis, like my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap(I just scrubbed a little on her head instead of using baby wash).</li>
            <li> A combination of this soap and skin lotion clears them up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who swears by it for uneven skin tones or acne.</li>
            <li> For 5 days I showered 3 times a day with this soap, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> I got Psoriasis and it helps keep it under control and less break outs !</li>
            <li> Usually follow with baby shampoo from Walmart for slight oder.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked by the smell.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap when I was a little boy staying with my grandparents up north, my grandfather used nothing but Pine Tar Soap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy again or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it daily if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> That leaves me with very few choices in the soap world.  </li>
            <li> and it slowly went up to $5 a bar.</li>
            <li> But addicted to it after a few days .  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not too overpowering, and is fairly subtle after you&#x27;ve rinsed off.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I hate more than getting out of a shower and my armpits still smell rank.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt that bad and goes away after you dry.</li>
            <li> If not you may find that irritating.  </li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I showered with it and immediately noticed that the itching decreased.</li>
            <li> This is not like axe soap or body spray people your buying this for the wrong reasons based on diluted reviewers .</li>
            <li> He has a terrible time with dry skin and it helps a lot.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband love them. Our bathroom smells like in the middle of the woods</li>
            <li> The bar itself smells VERY strong.  It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong when lathered up and applied though.  I have no problem with the smell personally.  Works and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Very good product, been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. I thought I would smell like a pine tree, but it leaves no lingering scent. We have super-hard water but this bar lathers great. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry as it generally does. My husband even washes his hair with it! Good all-purpose, no-nonsense soap with old-fashioned ingredients.</li>
            <li> My wife had pregnancy rash &#x27;pupps&#x27; and it was intolerable. She itched all day and night. We tried several treatments - itching creams, lotions, oat meal baths but nothing worked. Came across this soap and bought a couple just to try them out. 3 days into the process of taking 3-4 baths with this soap, itching was completely gone and 7 days no rashes were visible. This did wonders for her. We ordered a dozen more so that she could use it for the entire duration of pregnancy. This smells good too, so no need to apply anything on top of it.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin requires a mild, hypoallergenic, but effective soap.  This brand has been my first choice for 30 years.  The bulk-package pricing beat my other brick or mail-order sources by 30% or more.  Delivered on-time in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely not for everyone and it took me some getting used to as well but the soap itself leaves a great feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like you just wrestled a bear and if your itchy from the rustling it fixes it quick! Love this soap!!! Will buy again and again!!</li>
            <li> No girly-boy perfumed stuff here!  This is the real thing.  It works great in cold water, hard water, river water, rain water caught on a tarp.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a horrible acne problem i have tried everything from proactive to taking her to the dr. for help and no one or any product would help, all it done was make her face bleed. i read some reviews about this soap and said why not lets try it. this soap has cleared her face up i could not tell you how we feel, and how she is not embarrassed to go out anymore this soap has a not so nice smell only when you are using it but it works great who cares about the smell when washing.</li>
            <li> One month ago the price was $3 a bar and it slowly went up to $5 a bar. I have this stuff but I won&#x27;t be buying it again at this rip off price! Also the soap smells strong but after you dry off there is hardly any smell left on your skin . This is not like axe soap or body spray people your buying this for the wrong reasons based on diluted reviewers . This soap is meant for psoriasis or eczema . I mean you can help yourself to using as regular soap but if you think soap will make you manly you must be trying to make up for something ha</li>
            <li> Love this soap&lt;br /&gt;Love how clean you feel and the soap smell</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders on my eczema! I use this to help treat my condition, which I would consider to be moderate to severe eczema,  depending on the weather and my allergies. The scent is a bit strange at first, but you get used to it. My only complaint on it would have to be the cost of it. I had to buy a multi-pack of I think 6 or 8, to get a decent deal. ($21 something) which was better than $6-7/each.</li>
            <li> Lathers great and smells wonderful. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m one with the pine forest.</li>
            <li> I love the soap as it does what it says, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed and helps smooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;SMells aweful going on, like a wet bon-fire, but has not scent after you dry off.</li>
            <li> My order was just as it said it was. I started using this soap when I was a little boy staying with my grandparents up north, my grandfather used nothing but Pine Tar Soap! I started using it again about 4 years ago and it brings back memories of my grandpa. Pine Tar works really good for people with Dry Skin and Psoriasis as well. My wife has now been using my Pine Tar Soap for almost a year and it helps her Dry Skin. I got Psoriasis and it helps keep it under control and less break outs ! My 4 and 5 year old kids like it too, mostly of color and because it daddy&#x27;s soap, I let them think their sneaking my soap when they take their baths LoL.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell of this soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!  I have acne, and it works miracles clearing up my face.  I also use it as a body wash, and especially to prevent razor burn while shaving.  I also have psoriasis and it works so well on itchy skin.  I recommend this soap to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> While this soap may smell like campfires and swear words, it has been the best thing ever for my hands. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good soap.  Manly scent with a good lather for washing your hair and beard as well as body.  Dries up your skin a bit which is great if you have any sort of acne problems.  If not you may find that irritating.  It is a bit expensive and seems to go fast but with anti bacterial and anti fungal properties to me it seems worth it.</li>
            <li> It smells like a campfire, but it&#x27;s well worth it. It helps keep the psoriasis calm.  I tend to buy it bulk so that I don&#x27;t run out. The package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Smells like campfire and I love it. Worked great on my beard. Wish it lasted a little longer or was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I could find on this soap.  I really like the pine tar smell, reminds me of a simpler time when men were men, (in my imagination), and of camping.  It actually cleans surprisingly well and has NO xeno-estrogens, which no one wants but especially us men.  Many fragrances and soaps can have chemicals that will affect our hormones, such as xeno-estrogens.  Very few simple ingredients that work.  I use with a scrub brush and it has helped me clear up my back tremendously.</li>
            <li> nice soap. feels VERY clean the entire day. Might leave a little stain in the shower (nothing that wouldn&#x27;t come out with the shower head). HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> Good price and timely.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t have any skin issues (other than getting older :)) - I just love the smell!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it on my hair, beard, body.</li>
            <li> Great soap. It leaves no residue. The phrase squeaky clean comes to mind. I occasionally suffer from small dry patches or skin bumps, not really pimples. A combination of this soap and skin lotion clears them up in just a few days. Don&#x27;t let the initial smell put you off, it rinses off with the soap. I also notice less waste than with the bottled body wash.</li>
            <li> This soap is for my daughter and she loves this soap.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell does get weaker the longer it&#x27;s out of the package. I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now. I started because after my first pregnancy, I got eczema on my face, and it can still come and go with hormone changes. Having to use it on my face was a little weird at first with the smell being so strong, but the more it was exposed to the water and air it calmed down a bit. I now use it everywhere, and it&#x27;s great for everything. It seems to act as a bug repellant, helps with poison ivy, and it also helps with forms of dermatitis, like my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap(I just scrubbed a little on her head instead of using baby wash). I have recommended this to many people and they have found the same, that the smell gets lighter with use. I hope everyone will give Grandpa a chance!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, really has a clean feel.  I personally love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> Good soap, nice smoky scent.</li>
            <li> While the price is a bit much, and the lather is more of an off-white than a true white, and while it does smell pretty bad out of the box, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap acts as a potent degreasing agent. If you have oily skin, oily hair, or acne then you should really try this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were slightly cheaper, I&#x27;d bump this to a full five stars. I can live with the smell and the off-white lather because they don&#x27;t really matter once you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> This helped me when I was pregnant. I had severe itching  (pups) and in 2 days time it went away.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, we received our order a couple of days ago, he used it a couple of times and so far it&#x27;s good. He has a terrible time with dry skin and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This soap is quite enjoyable. Not only does it keep my skin from drying out, it also makes my shower smell like barbecue.</li>
            <li> Depending on the skin type, tar soap can make a big difference. Grandpa&#x27;s is very good example.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my skin goes through these &amp;#34;cycles&amp;#34; where it will be okay in the summer and really dry and patchy in the winter. I started using this soap early in the year and noticed such an incredible difference in my skin after just one use. Psoriasis cannot be cured, but it can be kept under control with different methods and this is definitely one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried. As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your body after leaving the shower and can be contained if the bar is kept in a plastic soap box (which I would recommend regardless to make it last as much as possible).</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who swears by it for uneven skin tones or acne.</li>
            <li> A few thin slices on your breakfast pancakes and your innards are clean for a month but don&#x27;t try that at home folks the smell is like napalm on the morning but is great at the same time you gonna&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> Love this soap. My skin has cleared up, my hair is dandruff-free and not greasy... wish I&#x27;d have found this years ago. It does have a strong smell (as in, you will smell it walking into your bathroom), but that strength doesn&#x27;t stay with you after you use it. You&#x27;ll smell great, but not from several feet away like a strong cologne or anything like that. The stuff&#x27;s perfect, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it reminds me of camping when i was a kid.  That aside, it does what it is supposed to do, and believe it or not I get complements on my &amp;#34;scent.&amp;#34;  Buy it if you want, things like soap (or anything these days)  are too subjective to review.  I have used it for at least a decade, did I mention I love the smell?</li>
            <li> I tend to have moderately dry skin in the winter. I try to moisture when I have time, but I don&#x27;t often have the time to wait for a  moisturizer to fully absorb before needing to get dressed. I also enjoy trying out different soaps. I came across this one while searching for a soap that wouldn&#x27;t further dry my skin. I&#x27;ll admit the name intrigued me. The smell is reminiscent of a campfire, which as another review stated gives it a very manly smell. But it&#x27;s not too overpowering, and is fairly subtle after you&#x27;ve rinsed off.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out, my skin is in the best condition it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my entire body, hair/head, face, &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Smell weird first .  But addicted to it after a few days .  It relieves my eczema skin rash .  My whole family used it up quick, will order multiple packs soon.  Worth the price and the trial !</li>
            <li> Will eventually build up in your sewage and clog the pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not make a difference.</li>
            <li> My husband has itchy skin and has psoriasis. Grandpa&#x27;s soap helps both problems and is not drying like other soaps.</li>
            <li> I use this for my psoriasis.  I am now free of any symptoms but this soap was just part of a regime of supplements and diet.</li>
            <li> This is good soap I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> wont use any other soap</li>
            <li> I work in a factory and this stuff removes all the dirt and grime that i miss after washing at work.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.  To me it has a pleasant piney smell.  My wife says it smells like Slim Jims; go figure.  Anyway, it keeps me clean and fresh, works well as a shampoo (yes the bar soap) and does a great job keeping my beard clean.  Good all purpose man soap (or woman soap).</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Great for showers and shaving</li>
            <li> We swear by this in the Ozarks. Many ticks here in the spring and summer. Friends who work for the conservation dept. told us this helps ward off some of them. We have used it for several years and it does seem to help, although one should still take the obvious precautions as well. It smells like a campfire when lathered but does not leave a lingering odor humans can detect on your skin. It is very gentle, and our kids say it has helped with acne as well. I like the way my skin feels after using it. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I will never need another brand of soap. The soap itself has a strong smell, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong sent on your body.</li>
            <li> Product and delivery as stated.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap has been a life saver for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t be buying the six pack if i hadn&#x27;t already tried the product and found it to be exactly what i need.  I suffer from psoriasis, so my rule of thumb is that i can not use a soap whose ingredients have more than three syllables, unless of course we are talking about scientific names of plants.  That leaves me with very few choices in the soap world.  Even the hypoallergenic soaps available at the grocery store seem to make my skin react.  This soap doesn&#x27;t.  Because of the same issues with chemicals in shampoo i also use this soap to wash my hair.  It has what i would call a masculine scent, woodsy, not flowery.  Not the chemical scents of commercial soaps and body sprays either.  If you have psoriasis or sensitive skin i would recommend giving this soap a shot.  In combination with removing a few food triggers from my diet i have been able to clear my skin almost entirely.</li>
            <li> Decided to try these out. At first I was shocked by the smell. It grew on me and now I really like it. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy again or not. I still have 3 more bars left before I have to cross that bridge.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this soap. Cleans extra well and the smell does go away.  Sometimes hard to find at local stores, but can find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell like a tall ship (they use pine tar in rigging).  We used to sail them so it is awesome to have the smell.  It is really gentle on our skin too.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews but in this case I feel that I should. Four of our six children have eczema. We have tried every lotion, soap, salve, cream, old wive&#x27;s tail that you can imagine... I read about this soap and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try... SOOOO glad we did, within 1 week we could tell a significant difference, within a month, hardly any noticible eczema... If you have similar issues, BUY THIS SOAP... It&#x27;s also great beard soap!</li>
            <li> Good soap. Leaves  your skin and hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get used to the scent but it leaves your skin clean and squeaky.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other soaps. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> great for peeling dead skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because my wife wanted me to have a beard, and it itched. Searched for a beard soap, found this. It works for my beard, rarely itches now. Nice lather, reduces my facial dermatitis and dandruff too. Still use other products for that but much less (about twice a month instead of every other day).&lt;br /&gt;  I love the smell, and it is not very strong to me. Dry patches on my knees and elbows that I have had for years went away--something I was not expecting or even looking for in the soap. Very surprised, and happy!</li>
            <li> I tried this soap as an alternative to Head and Shoulders for dandruff.  Head and Shoulders, or zinc shampoo works ok for me but only about three showers in a row.  Then I need to switch to a normal shampoo then back.  It never really got rid of my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpas Pine Tar Wonder Soap works way better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for fifteen years.  It works great for dandruff and great for my oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only hair and skin care product I use or need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would work great for teenagers to help prevent pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have given this soap to many people, men and women and they all have been converts.  Even the women who may not particularly like the piney smell, say it is wondefrul for their hair.  My mother credits it for her hair not going grey!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I came down with a severe case of PUPPP. Being so heavily pregnant is hard enough without having to deal with the rash from hell. I was absolutely miserable and truly felt I was going mad from the itch. I had barely slept in over a week and my skin was red raw all over from scratching when a Google search led me to this soap as a possible cure. My husband ordered me some right away. As soon as it arrived I showered with it and immediately noticed that the itching decreased. With each passing day the itching got less and less and the rash looked far less red and angry. For 5 days I showered 3 times a day with this soap, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off. I then went down to 2 showers a day and am now down to 1. It has been 9 days since I first used Grandpas Pine Tar Soap and I can happily say my PUPPP has completely cleared up. My doctor insisted nothing would make it go away apart from giving birth. When I showed her the results just from using this soap she was absolutely amazed and is going to pass the word onto other women with PUPPP. I am so incredibly happy and grateful that I found Grandpas Pine Tar Soap  and I have been raving about it to anyone who will listen. Thank you Grandpa!</li>
            <li> Soap so far is working for me! The smell isnt that bad and goes away after you dry.My skin has started to clear up so I&#x27;m very happy with that!!! The price was much better than the local Natural Food stores so I&#x27;m happy with that too. Guess you could say I&#x27;m just a \\&quot;Happy Camper\\&quot; And check out the Grampa&#x27;s web site...they have alot of nice products!</li>
            <li> The Soap is Awesome. But it Smells like a South Carolina Truck Stop.....Next to a Trash Incinerator.....Somewhere in a pine forest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2x, but it does make my hair feel like I&#x27;ve conditioned it after each shampoo &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch. I love the fact that I can use it all over my entire body, hair included. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry. The smell does last that long &amp; it lathers very well. I will buy this again. The cost is great to, considering that you can use it all over your body. I purchased this in bulk to save money. It smells like tar and a real Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> The best soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to clean my beard initially, however, I&#x27;ve found that I like using it al over. It is a great product for beards and people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing. Simply the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this soap is awesome IF you can deal with the smell. I couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for five years  and love everything about it, including the smell. It reminds me of being in a pine forest on a hot summer day, or a single malt scotch whisky such as Talisker. The smell doesn&#x27;t transfer to your skin though, which is probably a good thing because not everyone likes it. By the way, I used to work on a road paving crew and I would not go so far as to equate the smell with asphalt.</li>
            <li> Love this product, all natural and it works for all over. Head to toe. Great for a Manly smell and for facial hair.</li>
            <li> the best ever for dry skin</li>
            <li> Always looking in stores for this soap. Finally gave up and just went with Amazon. This is my travel soap, post workout soap and, &amp;#34;head-to-toe&amp;#34; soap when I don&#x27;t have shampoo. Love the scent and the clean feeling when using it. Rinses off better than any other. I&#x27;d use it daily if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for decades.  The scent is pleasant, not strong.  It seems to help with summertime itching due bug bites, pollen, seasonal allergies (except to pine trees -- why risk it), etc.  It can be used to wash hair but like most soaps, I find it hard to rinse completely out. The Grandpa line includes shampoo but I&#x27;ve never tried it.  Overall, a good soap and the pack of 6 sold by Amazon.com is a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> In 10 years we have not found a soap that works as well as this one for my son&#x27;s severe acne.  Nothing can clear it completely.  This soap is the most cleansing, clearing without drying and comfortable soap.</li>
            <li> Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar makes me feel like a man! You can use it for your whole body and when you are done you can use it to shave your face. Lets see your girly body wash do that!</li>
            <li> Great soap, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is crazamazing! That&#x27;s right folks, it&#x27;s so good that standard English wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and I had to make up a word! Dry scalp gone, acne gone, itchy skin gone. It really makes me wonder what was in store-bought soap to be this effective in comparison..</li>
            <li> Knocked my socks off.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with my dry skin problem.  I have reordered this product many times.  Very fast delivery of product. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> To me this soap smells to very close to freshly laid asphalt. When the bar is newish, It also makes your bathroom smell like that. If that smell would bother you then you wouldn&#x27;t want this soap. My wife and I like the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is a very nice quality soap that does a great job of removing body oils. There is nothing I hate more than getting out of a shower and my armpits still smell rank. Unlike commercial soaps, this has not been a problem with this soap. I always feel very clean and refreshed after showering with this. Also, it does not leave a smell on you. So no, you will not smell like freshly laid asphalt after showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this soap is it does not become a mushy mess at the end of its life. My soap dish, is a soap rack so it doesn&#x27;t hold water. However, even with that other soaps become a mushy mess at the end. This one just shrinks down and fades away.</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Feel very clean and fresh when one takes a shower and uses this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! The larger bars last longer but won&#x27;t fit in a soap dish for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, always feel very clean. Eczema isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man&#x27;s man and don&#x27;t mess around with fancy lotions and soaps and all that stuff.  I tell you what, though, I make an exception for pine tar soap.  This is the business.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  no dry skin in the winter for me!</li>
            <li> Gets you really clean</li>
            <li> We love love love this soap! It softens, cleans great, super sudsy,  and the smell is like a campfire on a warm summer evening.  Even great for hair! Works wonders for winter dandruff.  Seller had the best price, was super prompt, and, unlike the seller I tried to get the body wash from,  filled my order. What more could you want? Will use them again!</li>
            <li> Awesome soap helps any skin condition bothering you. Also has a potent campfire/woodsy scent to it, which transforms your bathroom into a pseudo camping experience. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> All Grandpa Pine Tar products are the best. My family uses this soap and the other products every day.</li>
            <li> I have only used Grandpas Pine Tar Soap for maybe 30 years or so. My father introduced it to me as he used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for our dry skin as well as good to shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t make me pretty but, I feel better!</li>
            <li> Great for seborrehic dermititus (dandruff). Great solution in controlling your dandruff. I use once or twice a week. Usually follow with baby shampoo from Walmart for slight oder. Old time products are better than new stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. You can use it as a whole-body cleaning solution. I use it on my skin, hair and beard all to great results. The bar seems to last longer than normal soap, I think due to how well this product lathers up.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I got this to wash my beard on a recommendation from a friend. I loved it so much I now use it to wash my whole body and hair. The smell is a bit strong at first (campfire and pine), but it quickly fades to a light pleasant woodsy smell. I love it so much I actually look forward to taking a shower every day. It&#x27;s also great for dry skin. Prior to using this soap I was having to use moisturizer on my hands and elbows. I haven&#x27;t used any moisturizer since getting this soap.</li>
