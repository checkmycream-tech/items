            <li>In my book, this product has been amazing already!</li>
            <li>Clinically Proven Skin Restoring Supplement for Amazing Anti-Aging Skincare Effects!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!.</li>
            <li>I believe this product is amazing and helped me with my finer lines and plumped up my skin!</li>
            <li>so I will take it until I finish it off, and to be fair</li>
            <li>I struggle to maintain my hair, skin and nails in good shape since I had gastric bypass surgery.</li>
            <li>but I feel good too.  </li>
            <li>Good as a supplements.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a good product.</li>
            <li>but I am very glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased I was asked to review and test this product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking this product a couple weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;Since taking the Phytoceramides, my skin looks GREAT - healthy, hydrated, and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has a more even tone, my fingernails have gone drastically, and even my hair seems to be longer!</li>
            <li>I would buy this product again as it give me a healthy look and helps my nails!</li>
            <li>so of course I have been looking for a product to help keep my hair and nails healthy as I age!</li>
            <li>/&gt;“Phytoceramides” by ReVive is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 months now and my skin looks and feels</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I received this product to test for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>received this in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how nice that is in this day and</li>
            <li>I kind of bought it on a whim.  </li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say that my skin appears to look healthier and it also feels smoother.</li>
            <li>This seems like a decent vitamin to take, my skin is going through a lot of hormonal changes so this is probably not the best time to be reviewing</li>
            <li>and all this is an astounding product that I thoroughly enjoy and one that I am more then happy to recommend to all.</li>
            <li>You will be very happy and surprised!</li>
            <li>My face looked better and I could not tell what the difference was until I studied myself in the mirror and realized that my under eye area looks better!</li>
            <li>very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li>but this one works the best so far.</li>
            <li>Fine lines smoothed out after using one bottle as directed!  </li>
            <li>I must say it is an amazing supplement, easy to take and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>love it~~ made my skin blowy and pinkish &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Likewise, my hair is in better condition since it appears to be retaining more moisture and is more malleable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time and can&#x27;t believe how much better my nails and skin look.</li>
            <li>Very happy to rate this product, and hope to see more of a difference in the future.</li>
            <li>I’m hopeful that I’ll see even better results in the coming weeks after the supplements have had more time to take effect.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I will try another month to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that I had more energy when I took the supplements, so that was a surprise bonus.</li>
            <li>I took Revive phytoceramides for about 2 weeks before I really saw change, but my skin feels GREAT now, and</li>
            <li>I love this product and will gladly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am truly glad I did.</li>
            <li>My cuticles don&#x27;t tear like they used to and on top of that</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love things that do more than one thing in one pill.</li>
            <li>A lot of the vitamins/supplements I take are because they help more than one problem.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more dewy and radiant.</li>
            <li>It was okay. .didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The longer you take these the more</li>
            <li>but these are okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that its fantastic!</li>
            <li>It seems smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li>I love the product because it did everything it says it would do.  </li>
            <li>I have lost the vitiman&#x27;s needed to keep my skin and hair healthy.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and smoother, more hydrated and radiant.</li>
            <li>I received a product free of charge for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>one thing I didn&#x27;t expect was I had more energy.</li>
            <li>i love it  </li>
            <li>keep  it in stock .  :)</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>The Revive supplement seemingly knows just the areas to target for more moisture.</li>
            <li>and I have been doing more research</li>
            <li>Skin is feeling better already.</li>
            <li>Things like this may take more than 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and do recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to come in contact with this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Phytoceramide capsules and it was a good one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are showing some significant changes!</li>
            <li>They are INCREDIBLY easy to work with, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend them more.</li>
            <li>These make your face look bright, clear and your make up goes on nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any fine lines/wrinkles reducing, but I still have 2 more weeks to go.</li>
            <li>This is helping hide the fine lines I&#x27;m seeing around my eyes and giving me a more wakeful, youthful complexion.</li>
            <li>I am also noticing a brighter appearance as well as a more plump look around my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results with a collagen supplement I take, but this product has me completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I am more upbeat, filled with energy and eager to get the day started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad this is gluten free as well.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I purchased this product just to see how it worked really and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>the hell, if I don&#x27;t like the effects I can just stop, right?&amp;#34; And so with my own advice I agreed and started to use the product right after I received it.</li>
            <li>My nails split and break easily.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more right now!  </li>
            <li>Fine lines are smoothed and skin is lifted without the need for any application of beauty products.</li>
            <li>I am not the best at being consistent daily and missed a days here and there.  </li>
            <li>I feel much more confident about the skin I&#x27;m in thanks to Revive!</li>
            <li>I am super picky when it comes to supplements, but I am getting to a point where I need to make sure I keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>First I must say if you put something good into your body you will get good things back.</li>
            <li>Since I started taking Revive, I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that although my complexion has not changed much yet, my hair and nails have.</li>
            <li>You can apply any kind of cream and see a difference, but the real test is the result from the supplements.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin E has made my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment many times over</li>
            <li>Another plus is its a Gluten free product which may be important for some individuals.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far the Phytoceramides have been good.</li>
            <li>I am over 50 years old so finding a good anti-aging supplement is a plus as well.</li>
            <li>I really wish it would, but i will try one more,,, just to make sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the added bonus of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this Phytoceramides, is that it really is 100% all natural, healthy, safe, and it&#x27;s even gluten free.</li>
            <li>For the number of pills provided, I am unsure if this can reduce the appearance of fine lines or rejuvenate the skin, but I feel that in a month you will definitely be able to see a positive difference in terms of your hair and nails.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try it at first but am really glad I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>l love it so much!</li>
            <li>I am excited about these Revive Phytoceramides pills because they work on the inside of your body and you are not just slapping something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am excited to keep taking this and seeing results.  </li>
            <li>I finished taking all the capsules in the bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any significant change in my skin</li>
            <li>So many good reviews I expected something to get excited about.</li>
            <li>The phytoceramides are top-notch, easy to consume, and are JUST as good as any other brand at HALF</li>
            <li>It seems it worked great and does seems to moisture your dry skin on face.  </li>
            <li>Of course the having Dr. Oz talking about the benefits of Phytoceramides certainly helped in convincing me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I found that taking it with food does prevent it from causing a stomachache, and I take it with a full glass of water.</li>
            <li>This definitely is one of the good things to put in your body and achieve results.  </li>
            <li>The combination of vitamins A, C, D and E may be there to help my skin rejuvenate, but it seems to be helping my whole being feel more rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Not only do I look good</li>
            <li>My fingernails are much stronger and do not split like they used to (have done that most of my life - and that hurts).  </li>
            <li>Within a few days, my skin felt fantastic, soft, smooth, hydrated, absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>She asked me if I&#x27;d been trying anything new because &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; was different and looking good!</li>
            <li>I also especially love that the most essential vitamins needed for glowing healthy skin are not only included, but it is your full daily dose.</li>
            <li>This is so important to me because I have used products before, not necessarily just this kind, and have needed to stop using because I could no longer afford it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Revive by Dr. Naturel and received my order rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>only difference during this time period was the addition of the Phytoceramides, so I can only assume that this change is what caused the awesome looking skin changes.  </li>
            <li>has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A dancer MUST look healthy if they are to keep working, and I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>again, cannot recommend more highly.</li>
            <li>From the very first week I began to feel the change in my skin.</li>
            <li>RThe Dr. Naturel REVIVE Rice Phytoceramides skin care supplements are advertised as a &amp;#34;clinically proven skin restoring supplement for amazing anti-aging skincare effects!&amp;#34;  Each capsule contains vitamins A, C, D &amp; E, all of which have been proven to be very beneficial to healthy, younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li>i really think long term it would do anyone great results.</li>
            <li>I have researched many products which claim to produce anti-aging affects and this is the first product that I really wanted to try.  </li>
            <li>I will a more evident proof if it really works or not.</li>
            <li>The opinions above are all my own true opinions and experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to be giving the supplement the full six weeks to see a complete change, but there has been a great deal of change in the last couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I was always wondering if these kind of products work, so I have been taking this supplement for a little more than two weeks, one capsule a day</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t you will be missing out on some great results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin, but my fingernails are fabulous.</li>
            <li>I rarely use lotion on my hands, because I wash them so often throughout the day that I don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Pricy (worth it, but pricy)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains natural organic ingredients rather then un-natural supplements and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like the ALIVE for women product better</li>
            <li>I have used it for 2 months  and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>The price is right and worth a try.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I am very concerned about what is under the added sticky label that was placed over part of the original label.  </li>
            <li>If the product worked for me, it&#x27;ll work for anybody because I react to many of its kind I took in the past.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just once a day and is very easy to add into my daily supplement routine.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to review this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>I guess good genetics will only get you so far!</li>
            <li>Backed by the 100% satisfaction guaranteed promise this product is a risk free new weapon</li>
            <li>My skin does feel a bit smoother and less flaky which is really good since it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li>After taking this amazing supplement for only a week, I have noticed my skin feels much softer than before.</li>
            <li>As I started to get older those fine lines and wrinkles began to really bother me.</li>
            <li>I have tried using creams and serums together but always felt like more could be done and had never thought about actually using a vitamin supplement</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to trail and</li>
            <li>My skin seems more balanced overall.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Revive and the first thing I did when I got it was gave the pills a sniff.</li>
            <li>I, at first, was hesitant but she was persistent and I gave in.</li>
            <li>Will know more later on.</li>
            <li>Although I opted for cover up, it began to become pretty costly for me.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I can only it is okay maybe after a 3 month period</li>
            <li>My moisturizers seem to be working much better, with no dryness episodes later in the day.</li>
            <li>I also found topical ceramides may be more helpful for the skin which is what I would like to improve.</li>
            <li>Now, I can not say with 100% certainty exactly how this product works, but I can give you the facts...</li>
            <li>but I found out ceramides are found naturally in a lot of foods and have just decided to increase my consumption with phytoceramide rich foods and see what happens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very cost effective in comparison to botox and other injectable fillers.</li>
            <li>This product offers a youthful glow with a quick pop of a pill.</li>
            <li>I would not have guessed something is this easy and simple to use</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what things look like a few more weeks from now!</li>
            <li>Hydrating a lot more seemed to help a little, but not dramatically, so I figured the right supplement might help -- and it really did!</li>
            <li>I like this product so far, makes my skin and myself feel great which is very important during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My face seems much brighter</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really think I can see a difference, and will order again.  </li>
            <li>will update this review if it really wows me.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use as much concealer</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really review.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>is really going to show any results.</li>
            <li>A bonus is that my fingernails which have always chipped and peeled at the ends seem much stronger, too.</li>
            <li>I took the pills, but didn&#x27;t notice any real changes.</li>
            <li>I do use lotion, but it never seems to really fix the issue.</li>
            <li>My body is baby soft, which to me, makes the product worth it.</li>
            <li>Works very well with keeping skin un- wrinkled.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related, but my nails have been looking fabulous, too.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help skin</li>
            <li>thank you so much never used this product before i would buy it again</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the creams I used in my regimen.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for my nails</li>
            <li>I have been a professional dancer and performer for over 13 years, and have trained under some of the world&#x27;s most renowned masters of the Kirov Russian ballet since I was in my teens</li>
            <li>so I would try this on your own accord and maybe seek medical advice, especially if you have health issues.</li>
            <li>I go out the house with more pride because I finally have a clear face.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive when I received this order - the plastic containers and labels look cheaply printed, but I had such high hopes from all the responses that I overlooked them.</li>
            <li>But the folks who developed the Dr. Natural REVIVE Rice Phytoceramide supplement have Included ALL FOUR vitamins in one surprisingly affordable game-changing formula!&lt;br /&gt;One gluten-free vitamin-charged capsule, once a day for less than $20 per month?  </li>
            <li>My skin feels plump, smooth, and moisturized, even though I have had an issue with dry skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started on the second bottle, since it says it takes 2 full months before results are achieved, but already my nails are thicker and stronger, so I might be on to something.</li>
            <li>when I get older I will up the dosage.</li>
            <li>Once I started taking this supplement, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands feel much softer and they&#x27;re slowly healing on its own without the help of lotion.</li>
            <li>After 60 days, using before and after photos; there are visible results of fewer wrinkles particularly the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product and will not buy any product that uses Dr. Oz as an endorser unless he specifically endorses that particular product.</li>
            <li>I sure as hell don&#x27;t feel any younger or look younger, my skin&#x27;s vitality did not improve; in fact nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>I made a deal with myself to start my anti-aging routine after 25, so that I would be proactive and not have to worry about wrinkles and skin issues when I am older.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure yet as to how much it is actually doing for my skin, it seems to be helping, but as time passes I know it will make a difference simply because of the high quality ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this products after reading the reviews and had high hopes for my dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>but I would definitely highly recommend to anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m noticing is that my skin is clearer and that the tone is a little more even.</li>
            <li>I have always been a bit picky with my skin, you know no harsh products on my face etc, and have always had relatively good skin, never suffered from zits or acne, and have only really had to deal with dry skin occasionally.</li>
            <li>Try Neocell collagen instead, it really works, even for mature skin.</li>
            <li>Alone, each of these vitamins are key ingredients in some of the most effective (and expensive) anti-aging formulas today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now encouraged enough to reinforce the improvement with a little of my own effort, such as more water drinking and right eating - and less junk stuff.</li>
            <li>Now I have absolutely no patches of dry skin which is amazing for me this time of year.  </li>
            <li>I mean, all the women in my family have amazing skin</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for two weeks but already see positive changes!</li>
            <li>Also, because the product claims to put moisture back into the skin, I did a little experiment of my own.</li>
            <li>Let me just say, the results I saw in just a few short weeks were amazing.</li>
            <li>B00NJYFTLE Oculift - Doctor Recommended Eye Serum for Diminishing Dark Circles, Puffiness, Bags, Fine Lines and Wrinkles.]</li>
            <li>Very surprised about this ...</li>
            <li>My skin was either too oily, too dry, too bumpy and now that I&#x27;m getting older crows feet!!!  </li>
            <li>And I think my hair is coming in a little thicker as well ... which is important to me because I&#x27;m getting older and still do color it.  </li>
            <li>I am getting compliments on how young I look all the time!</li>
            <li>A Natural Facelift!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to boost the look and health of your natural attributes, buy REVIVE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my wrinkles got any better or not.</li>
            <li>For now my skin is smooth and it seems like the wrinkles around the eyes is minimally less.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical at first when I read that.</li>
            <li>This is a little different than most reviews that I write.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, looks more plump and the tiny little wrinkles around my eyes are lessening.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d stop using lotion on other areas of my body completely, because I have mild eczema on my legs.</li>
            <li>I am 65 yrs old.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The Revive with rice has completely changed my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am aging but still feel young</li>
            <li>so I may look for another site to find the complete package information.  </li>
            <li>When I found out all of the ingredients were natural I decided I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I am nearly done with my bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed complete change with my skin.  </li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>This made my whole face look like it did when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t swallow it fast enough!</li>
            <li>It did not take as much conditioner when washing my hair which was proof enough for me that I was/am getting results.</li>
            <li>Being in my early 30s</li>
            <li>My nails seem to be a lot tougher and not as easily bendable as they usually are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Makes my skin feel smoother (have not taken it for the full 6 weeks yet, but I have needed less lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I see a difference, however, I definitely feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very thing, hair fine, and nails thin and brittle.</li>
            <li>It is not only soft; the dryness is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Well maybe I am wrong but does make my face look and feel better !</li>
            <li>I just got the product the other day, so it is too soon to tell whether or not I will see significant difference in my dry skin and brittle nails.</li>
            <li>(I never really noticed I had crow&#x27;s feet, but like any smart husband, I&#x27;m going to take her word for that.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I never have high hopes for products because they only seem to work briefly, if not at all.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really watch Dr. Oz, so I&#x27;m not sure what he said about the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; in the apparent 4 - 8 weeks - it took me 62 years for my skin to be in the condition</li>
            <li>I am only 34 years old</li>
            <li>As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed some patchy dry spots popping up on my face and on my arms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not convinced with the first order that this product actually makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to take care of my skin more, and have noticed some lines that I&#x27;m not happy about.</li>
            <li>Besides the obvious (and researchable) benefits, and the fact doctors recommend phytoceramides, it is FAR cheaper than other products which are THE EXACT SAME THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed after just a few days my skin felt more hydrated, i had less bumps on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li>and my nails grow long naturally</li>
            <li>I frequently get dry patches on my skin, forehead and nose, but these are beginning to diminish.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this product to test for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> received this in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how nice that is in this day and</li>
            <li> I kind of bought it on a whim.  </li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> and i can honestly say that my skin appears to look healthier and it also feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This seems like a decent vitamin to take, my skin is going through a lot of hormonal changes so this is probably not the best time to be reviewing</li>
            <li> and all this is an astounding product that I thoroughly enjoy and one that I am more then happy to recommend to all.</li>
            <li> You will be very happy and surprised!</li>
            <li> My face looked better and I could not tell what the difference was until I studied myself in the mirror and realized that my under eye area looks better!</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> but this one works the best so far.</li>
            <li> Fine lines smoothed out after using one bottle as directed!  </li>
            <li> I must say it is an amazing supplement, easy to take and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> love it~~ made my skin blowy and pinkish &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Likewise, my hair is in better condition since it appears to be retaining more moisture and is more malleable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time and can&#x27;t believe how much better my nails and skin look.</li>
            <li> Very happy to rate this product, and hope to see more of a difference in the future.</li>
            <li> I’m hopeful that I’ll see even better results in the coming weeks after the supplements have had more time to take effect.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I will try another month to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that I had more energy when I took the supplements, so that was a surprise bonus.</li>
            <li> I took Revive phytoceramides for about 2 weeks before I really saw change, but my skin feels GREAT now, and</li>
            <li> I love this product and will gladly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am truly glad I did.</li>
            <li> My cuticles don&#x27;t tear like they used to and on top of that</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love things that do more than one thing in one pill.</li>
            <li> A lot of the vitamins/supplements I take are because they help more than one problem.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more dewy and radiant.</li>
            <li> It was okay. .didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The longer you take these the more</li>
            <li> but these are okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that its fantastic!</li>
            <li> It seems smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> I love the product because it did everything it says it would do.  </li>

            <li> My skin feels softer and smoother, more hydrated and radiant.</li>
            <li> I received a product free of charge for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> one thing I didn&#x27;t expect was I had more energy.</li>
            <li> i love it  </li>
            <li> keep  it in stock .  :)</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> The Revive supplement seemingly knows just the areas to target for more moisture.</li>
            <li> and I have been doing more research</li>
            <li> Skin is feeling better already.</li>
            <li> Things like this may take more than 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and do recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to come in contact with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Phytoceramide capsules and it was a good one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are showing some significant changes!</li>
            <li> They are INCREDIBLY easy to work with, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend them more.</li>
            <li> These make your face look bright, clear and your make up goes on nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any fine lines/wrinkles reducing, but I still have 2 more weeks to go.</li>
            <li> This is helping hide the fine lines I&#x27;m seeing around my eyes and giving me a more wakeful, youthful complexion.</li>
            <li> I am also noticing a brighter appearance as well as a more plump look around my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results with a collagen supplement I take, but this product has me completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I am more upbeat, filled with energy and eager to get the day started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad this is gluten free as well.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I purchased this product just to see how it worked really and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> the hell, if I don&#x27;t like the effects I can just stop, right?&amp;#34; And so with my own advice I agreed and started to use the product right after I received it.</li>
            <li> My nails split and break easily.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more right now!  </li>
            <li> Fine lines are smoothed and skin is lifted without the need for any application of beauty products.</li>
            <li> I am not the best at being consistent daily and missed a days here and there.  </li>
            <li> I feel much more confident about the skin I&#x27;m in thanks to Revive!</li>
            <li> I am super picky when it comes to supplements, but I am getting to a point where I need to make sure I keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> First I must say if you put something good into your body you will get good things back.</li>
            <li> Since I started taking Revive, I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that although my complexion has not changed much yet, my hair and nails have.</li>
            <li> You can apply any kind of cream and see a difference, but the real test is the result from the supplements.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin E has made my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment many times over</li>
            <li> Another plus is its a Gluten free product which may be important for some individuals.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far the Phytoceramides have been good.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 years old so finding a good anti-aging supplement is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I really wish it would, but i will try one more,,, just to make sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the added bonus of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this Phytoceramides, is that it really is 100% all natural, healthy, safe, and it&#x27;s even gluten free.</li>
            <li> For the number of pills provided, I am unsure if this can reduce the appearance of fine lines or rejuvenate the skin, but I feel that in a month you will definitely be able to see a positive difference in terms of your hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try it at first but am really glad I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> l love it so much!</li>
            <li> I am excited about these Revive Phytoceramides pills because they work on the inside of your body and you are not just slapping something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am excited to keep taking this and seeing results.  </li>
            <li> I finished taking all the capsules in the bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any significant change in my skin</li>
            <li> So many good reviews I expected something to get excited about.</li>
            <li> The phytoceramides are top-notch, easy to consume, and are JUST as good as any other brand at HALF</li>
            <li> It seems it worked great and does seems to moisture your dry skin on face.  </li>
            <li> Of course the having Dr. Oz talking about the benefits of Phytoceramides certainly helped in convincing me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I found that taking it with food does prevent it from causing a stomachache, and I take it with a full glass of water.</li>
            <li> This definitely is one of the good things to put in your body and achieve results.  </li>
            <li> The combination of vitamins A, C, D and E may be there to help my skin rejuvenate, but it seems to be helping my whole being feel more rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Not only do I look good</li>
            <li> My fingernails are much stronger and do not split like they used to (have done that most of my life - and that hurts).  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, my skin felt fantastic, soft, smooth, hydrated, absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> She asked me if I&#x27;d been trying anything new because &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; was different and looking good!</li>
            <li> I also especially love that the most essential vitamins needed for glowing healthy skin are not only included, but it is your full daily dose.</li>
            <li> This is so important to me because I have used products before, not necessarily just this kind, and have needed to stop using because I could no longer afford it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Revive by Dr. Naturel and received my order rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> only difference during this time period was the addition of the Phytoceramides, so I can only assume that this change is what caused the awesome looking skin changes.  </li>
            <li> has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A dancer MUST look healthy if they are to keep working, and I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> again, cannot recommend more highly.</li>
            <li> From the very first week I began to feel the change in my skin.</li>
            <li> RThe Dr. Naturel REVIVE Rice Phytoceramides skin care supplements are advertised as a &amp;#34;clinically proven skin restoring supplement for amazing anti-aging skincare effects!&amp;#34;  Each capsule contains vitamins A, C, D &amp; E, all of which have been proven to be very beneficial to healthy, younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li> i really think long term it would do anyone great results.</li>
            <li> I have researched many products which claim to produce anti-aging affects and this is the first product that I really wanted to try.  </li>
            <li> I will a more evident proof if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> The opinions above are all my own true opinions and experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to be giving the supplement the full six weeks to see a complete change, but there has been a great deal of change in the last couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I was always wondering if these kind of products work, so I have been taking this supplement for a little more than two weeks, one capsule a day</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t you will be missing out on some great results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin, but my fingernails are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I rarely use lotion on my hands, because I wash them so often throughout the day that I don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Pricy (worth it, but pricy)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains natural organic ingredients rather then un-natural supplements and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like the ALIVE for women product better</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 months  and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> The price is right and worth a try.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I am very concerned about what is under the added sticky label that was placed over part of the original label.  </li>
            <li> If the product worked for me, it&#x27;ll work for anybody because I react to many of its kind I took in the past.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just once a day and is very easy to add into my daily supplement routine.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to review this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> I guess good genetics will only get you so far!</li>
            <li> Backed by the 100% satisfaction guaranteed promise this product is a risk free new weapon</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a bit smoother and less flaky which is really good since it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li> After taking this amazing supplement for only a week, I have noticed my skin feels much softer than before.</li>
            <li> As I started to get older those fine lines and wrinkles began to really bother me.</li>
            <li> I have tried using creams and serums together but always felt like more could be done and had never thought about actually using a vitamin supplement</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to trail and</li>
            <li> My skin seems more balanced overall.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Revive and the first thing I did when I got it was gave the pills a sniff.</li>
            <li> I, at first, was hesitant but she was persistent and I gave in.</li>
            <li> Will know more later on.</li>
            <li> Although I opted for cover up, it began to become pretty costly for me.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I can only it is okay maybe after a 3 month period</li>
            <li> My moisturizers seem to be working much better, with no dryness episodes later in the day.</li>
            <li> I also found topical ceramides may be more helpful for the skin which is what I would like to improve.</li>
            <li> Now, I can not say with 100% certainty exactly how this product works, but I can give you the facts...</li>
            <li> but I found out ceramides are found naturally in a lot of foods and have just decided to increase my consumption with phytoceramide rich foods and see what happens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very cost effective in comparison to botox and other injectable fillers.</li>
            <li> This product offers a youthful glow with a quick pop of a pill.</li>
            <li> I would not have guessed something is this easy and simple to use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what things look like a few more weeks from now!</li>
            <li> Hydrating a lot more seemed to help a little, but not dramatically, so I figured the right supplement might help -- and it really did!</li>
            <li> I like this product so far, makes my skin and myself feel great which is very important during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My face seems much brighter</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really think I can see a difference, and will order again.  </li>
            <li> will update this review if it really wows me.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use as much concealer</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really review.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> is really going to show any results.</li>
            <li> A bonus is that my fingernails which have always chipped and peeled at the ends seem much stronger, too.</li>
            <li> I took the pills, but didn&#x27;t notice any real changes.</li>
            <li> I do use lotion, but it never seems to really fix the issue.</li>
            <li> My body is baby soft, which to me, makes the product worth it.</li>
            <li> Works very well with keeping skin un- wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related, but my nails have been looking fabulous, too.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help skin</li>
            <li> thank you so much never used this product before i would buy it again</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the creams I used in my regimen.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for my nails</li>
            <li> I have been a professional dancer and performer for over 13 years, and have trained under some of the world&#x27;s most renowned masters of the Kirov Russian ballet since I was in my teens</li>
            <li> so I would try this on your own accord and maybe seek medical advice, especially if you have health issues.</li>
            <li> I go out the house with more pride because I finally have a clear face.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive when I received this order - the plastic containers and labels look cheaply printed, but I had such high hopes from all the responses that I overlooked them.</li>
            <li> But the folks who developed the Dr. Natural REVIVE Rice Phytoceramide supplement have Included ALL FOUR vitamins in one surprisingly affordable game-changing formula!&lt;br /&gt;One gluten-free vitamin-charged capsule, once a day for less than $20 per month?  </li>
            <li> My skin feels plump, smooth, and moisturized, even though I have had an issue with dry skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started on the second bottle, since it says it takes 2 full months before results are achieved, but already my nails are thicker and stronger, so I might be on to something.</li>
            <li> when I get older I will up the dosage.</li>
            <li> Once I started taking this supplement, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands feel much softer and they&#x27;re slowly healing on its own without the help of lotion.</li>
            <li> After 60 days, using before and after photos; there are visible results of fewer wrinkles particularly the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product and will not buy any product that uses Dr. Oz as an endorser unless he specifically endorses that particular product.</li>
            <li> I sure as hell don&#x27;t feel any younger or look younger, my skin&#x27;s vitality did not improve; in fact nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> I made a deal with myself to start my anti-aging routine after 25, so that I would be proactive and not have to worry about wrinkles and skin issues when I am older.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure yet as to how much it is actually doing for my skin, it seems to be helping, but as time passes I know it will make a difference simply because of the high quality ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this products after reading the reviews and had high hopes for my dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> but I would definitely highly recommend to anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m noticing is that my skin is clearer and that the tone is a little more even.</li>
            <li> I have always been a bit picky with my skin, you know no harsh products on my face etc, and have always had relatively good skin, never suffered from zits or acne, and have only really had to deal with dry skin occasionally.</li>
            <li> Try Neocell collagen instead, it really works, even for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Alone, each of these vitamins are key ingredients in some of the most effective (and expensive) anti-aging formulas today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now encouraged enough to reinforce the improvement with a little of my own effort, such as more water drinking and right eating - and less junk stuff.</li>
            <li> Now I have absolutely no patches of dry skin which is amazing for me this time of year.  </li>
            <li> I mean, all the women in my family have amazing skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks but already see positive changes!</li>
            <li> Also, because the product claims to put moisture back into the skin, I did a little experiment of my own.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, the results I saw in just a few short weeks were amazing.</li>
            <li> B00NJYFTLE Oculift - Doctor Recommended Eye Serum for Diminishing Dark Circles, Puffiness, Bags, Fine Lines and Wrinkles.]</li>
            <li> Very surprised about this ...</li>
            <li> My skin was either too oily, too dry, too bumpy and now that I&#x27;m getting older crows feet!!!  </li>
            <li> And I think my hair is coming in a little thicker as well ... which is important to me because I&#x27;m getting older and still do color it.  </li>
            <li> I am getting compliments on how young I look all the time!</li>
            <li> A Natural Facelift!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to boost the look and health of your natural attributes, buy REVIVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my wrinkles got any better or not.</li>
            <li> For now my skin is smooth and it seems like the wrinkles around the eyes is minimally less.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical at first when I read that.</li>
            <li> This is a little different than most reviews that I write.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, looks more plump and the tiny little wrinkles around my eyes are lessening.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d stop using lotion on other areas of my body completely, because I have mild eczema on my legs.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The Revive with rice has completely changed my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am aging but still feel young</li>
            <li> so I may look for another site to find the complete package information.  </li>
            <li> When I found out all of the ingredients were natural I decided I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I am nearly done with my bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed complete change with my skin.  </li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> This made my whole face look like it did when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t swallow it fast enough!</li>
            <li> It did not take as much conditioner when washing my hair which was proof enough for me that I was/am getting results.</li>
            <li> Being in my early 30s</li>
            <li> My nails seem to be a lot tougher and not as easily bendable as they usually are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Makes my skin feel smoother (have not taken it for the full 6 weeks yet, but I have needed less lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I see a difference, however, I definitely feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very thing, hair fine, and nails thin and brittle.</li>
            <li> It is not only soft; the dryness is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Well maybe I am wrong but does make my face look and feel better !</li>
            <li> I just got the product the other day, so it is too soon to tell whether or not I will see significant difference in my dry skin and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> (I never really noticed I had crow&#x27;s feet, but like any smart husband, I&#x27;m going to take her word for that.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I never have high hopes for products because they only seem to work briefly, if not at all.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really watch Dr. Oz, so I&#x27;m not sure what he said about the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; in the apparent 4 - 8 weeks - it took me 62 years for my skin to be in the condition</li>
            <li> I am only 34 years old</li>
            <li> As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed some patchy dry spots popping up on my face and on my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not convinced with the first order that this product actually makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to take care of my skin more, and have noticed some lines that I&#x27;m not happy about.</li>
            <li> Besides the obvious (and researchable) benefits, and the fact doctors recommend phytoceramides, it is FAR cheaper than other products which are THE EXACT SAME THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed after just a few days my skin felt more hydrated, i had less bumps on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li> and my nails grow long naturally</li>
            <li> I frequently get dry patches on my skin, forehead and nose, but these are beginning to diminish.</li>
            <li> These really make a difference in your face, but a couple of days after running out I could see my face going back to blotchy and pale looking.  </li>
            <li> Being sensitive to gluten, I need to be very careful about pills I take in.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference after a couple weeks of taking as far as overall appearance.</li>
            <li> did not take long enough to tell if it worked, product sent as agree and on time</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t taken them long enough to see if they are going to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I think I look much better, no more awful flaky skin so it must be more hydrated, phew!</li>
            <li> I have really dry facial skin</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve suffered from dry skin and red marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a tiny bit around eyes &amp; that really is not a problem area.</li>
            <li> Maybe you have to use for a long period of time??</li>
            <li> and I am now a life long customer of ReVive and “Phytoceramides.”</li>
            <li> After taking this for 2 weeks, I am noticing that my skin seems to stay hydrated longer after applying moisturizer and that the red &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my arms appears to be getting smoother and a bit less red.  </li>
            <li> When I got back from holiday my face looked dry and drawn, not really what you want when you&#x27;ve just been away.</li>
            <li> Probably all due to aging and medical conditions.</li>
            <li> I had a question and they were not only extremely polite, but made me feel like I was a priority to their business.</li>
            <li> I am only 25 and wished that my skin would show my youth instead of making other people guess my age around 30 or 35.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> and my skin tends to get really dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it&#x27;s so dry that it will crack and blend..</li>
            <li> So, what I would do is wash my face and pat it dry</li>
            <li> Now the dry spots are gone and that is a relief because I was pouring on oil and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> She recommended this product to me because my skin was dry and lackluster.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, eczema, and psoriasis and this</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks, but I am definitely seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this for the past month so far</li>
            <li> so I have been the victim of stress and it has wreaked havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve came to the conclusion that they are all a bunch of crap and only a healthy lifestyle and moderate exercise</li>
            <li> I typically have combination skin making it hard to find a product that won&#x27;t either make my skin oily or dry certain areas out.</li>
            <li> And, I used to have a small dry patch on my upper left cheek which I can&#x27;t see anymore.</li>
            <li> She drinks loads of water, take a few other supplements, exercises regularly and up until recently used to teach aerobics and</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one week her dry patches are gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using the product for 13 days, but I can see a slight difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> There are some creams that I have used in the past that has helped, but it only works a short time.</li>
            <li> After taken this for only about a week I noticed a slight change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of split cuticles because I do woodworking and my hands get very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be really frustrating putting on my make-up because of the dry skin, then at times my face is really oily.</li>
            <li> My nails and nail-bed just look healthier overall and my nails have been growing a little faster.</li>
            <li> Been almost a month &amp; next to little change.</li>
            <li> , my wife says I&#x27;m looking a little younger.</li>
            <li> just a little while of taking them, I can definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li> I even noticed my little crows feet by my eyes are starting to fade.  </li>
            <li> Due to some skin problems, I tend to have skin that is dry and rough to the touch, so when a friend of mine suggested I check out Revive, I figured it could not hurt.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> After about 10 days I noticed my nails looked shiny and seemed to be harder.</li>
            <li> price aside (because all factors must be considered when one&#x27;s career partially depends upon looks), this company&#x27;s customer service is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> As a working mom, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that can help me with my skin, hair and nails with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It was softer not as rough as before use.</li>
            <li> do as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product for a few months and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible changes in my face I have noticed an overall improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I generally have dry skin in the winter time (those cold winds don&#x27;t help much).</li>
            <li> Saw some results but not nearly as much as have been tauted on Dr. Oz and other media.</li>
            <li> Main point - supplements - not to be confused with just use this and skip everything else - diet, exercise, cleansing, etc.  </li>
            <li> Ever since my wife had our third child she has complained of dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> I have taken other hair, skin, and nails supplements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face has become a little plumper and looking a little younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a 5 star and if not pleased after 30 days, will come back and update.</li>
            <li> It stopped me from checking out other products.</li>
            <li> I heard about rice phytoceramides as a recommended alternative to wheat and it&#x27;s other benefits.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if was caused by the sudden change in temperature</li>
            <li> Revive on the other hand has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried other skin products and regimens but nothing that worked like this product.</li>
            <li> As someone with extremely dry skin (I have eczema), I can already see a difference in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any positive changes in my skin after taking this for a month.</li>
            <li> but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made it worse!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that my face was dull before, but I noticed an extra glow since taking these.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, washing my hands so much has chapped my skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative about this product is the taste</li>
            <li> I started taking a pill everyday as part of my daily routine and after about two weeks I started noticing small changes.</li>
            <li> It was as if I had been slowly growing younger.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin especially in the winter, my nails are also on the weak side.</li>
            <li> Like with other products endorsed by Dr. Oz, that I have tried, I reaped little if no benefit.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this supplement for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed within a month of taking Revive, my nails are less brittle and my hair seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li> ALSO - that area was cleverly hidden in the photos displayed on the web page when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I looked through the previous reviews and noted that one or two made the comment that they saw no difference</li>
            <li> but I did notice a slight increase in hair growth and thickness</li>
            <li> By the time I had been using for six weeks I had made a serious step forward in my skin and overall look.</li>
            <li> My skin is already feeling smoother with much less texture.</li>
            <li> Doing this for several days, I would notice that my face didn&#x27;t feel tight and that I could feel a very small amount of oiliness along both sides of my nostrils.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually dry and at times irate but lately since using Phytoceramides it has become smoother.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect a turn-around in a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> When I started taking this I had quite a few wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any differences, yet, but I understand it can take a few weeks</li>
            <li> I picked up some of this stuff a few weeks ago and I like it.</li>
            <li> After all, what have you got to lose, a few years?</li>
            <li> within 2 weeks of beginning the phytoceramides, I  no longer had to use the additional, heavy face and body moisturizers that I had been using all winter.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting hard bumps along my jawline and a few on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I saw no notable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it can make my skin appear brighter and less dull!</li>
            <li> but make me wast my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> And I hated those lines above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve never been stronger, I know it&#x27;s supposed to take at least 4 months to notice improvements in your skin.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing really fast and seem healthier at the base.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Dumb, I know.  </li>
            <li> I have used the whole bottle as directed, but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to the supplier throughout my course of ordering and they stand behind their product, and their guarantee, 100%.</li>
            <li> sort-of glows -- the bumps are almost gone, and my face doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore.</li>
            <li> As someone that suffers from dry skin like crazy, I have tried everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking as badly as it was a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> so I am a little disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I admit that I was skeptical when my wife kept adding these to my morning vitamin regime.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I was approached to review it, but I figured, &amp;#34;What</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me, nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> Saw products like this one on Dr. Oz, but I&#x27;m always skeptical.  </li>
            <li> My skin can be really horrible at times because I have both oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hair skin and nails are/were horrible dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> and what call chicken skin on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I also cannot take pills that have a bad after taste.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a terrible vitamin taste that I don&#x27;t think anyone is a fan of!</li>
            <li> So at this point I guess I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> did not take long enough to tell if it worked, product sent as agree and on time</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> love it~~ made my skin blowy and pinkish &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have been taking this supplement for about a week and a half and I feel like it does work. I can honestly say that although my complexion has not changed much yet, my hair and nails have. My nails seem to be a lot tougher and not as easily bendable as they usually are. My nails and nail-bed just look healthier overall and my nails have been growing a little faster. Likewise, my hair is in better condition since it appears to be retaining more moisture and is more malleable. For the number of pills provided, I am unsure if this can reduce the appearance of fine lines or rejuvenate the skin, but I feel that in a month you will definitely be able to see a positive difference in terms of your hair and nails. Hopefully it can make my skin appear brighter and less dull! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this Phytoceramides, is that it really is 100% all natural, healthy, safe, and it&#x27;s even gluten free. I also especially love that the most essential vitamins needed for glowing healthy skin are not only included, but it is your full daily dose. I&#x27;m not quite sure yet as to how much it is actually doing for my skin, it seems to be helping, but as time passes I know it will make a difference simply because of the high quality ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> This is a little different than most reviews that I write.  I have been using this product for about a month now.  Quite honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I see a difference, however, I definitely feel better about myself.  I have researched many products which claim to produce anti-aging affects and this is the first product that I really wanted to try.  I was impressed with the ingredients and with the reviews I had read.  I didn&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; in the apparent 4 - 8 weeks - it took me 62 years for my skin to be in the condition it is and I don&#x27;t expect a turn-around in a little over a month.  BUT, I know that I do feel a difference in my skin - softer and actually glowing.  I like that the ingredients are working from the &amp;#34;inside-out&amp;#34;.  You can apply any kind of cream and see a difference, but the real test is the result from the supplements.  Main point - supplements - not to be confused with just use this and skip everything else - diet, exercise, cleansing, etc.  Oh yes, the business end -- the pricing is great.  I can actually afford to continue the treatments.  This is so important to me because I have used products before, not necessarily just this kind, and have needed to stop using because I could no longer afford it.  Bottom line - I am very happy with my purchase and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old. When I started taking this I had quite a few wrinkles around my mouth. And I hated those lines above my upper lip. I have been taking it 6 months now. It is awesome. All the wrinkles are gone. I am getting compliments on how young I look all the time! I think it made my hands look younger too! I have heard that 350 mg is the recommended dosage, but this 40 mg works just great! The weay I see it. when I get older I will up the dosage. For now this is all I need.</li>
            <li> I have taken other hair, skin, and nails supplements but this one works the best so far. I&#x27;ve noticed within a month of taking Revive, my nails are less brittle and my hair seems to grow faster. My skin does feel a bit smoother and less flaky which is really good since it&#x27;s winter and my skin tends to get really dry.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks but already see positive changes! My skin has a more even tone, my fingernails have gone drastically, and even my hair seems to be longer! I am only 34 years old but I am the mom of four kids and also work outside the home so I have been the victim of stress and it has wreaked havoc on my skin. I have tried using creams and serums together but always felt like more could be done and had never thought about actually using a vitamin supplement but I am very glad I chose this one. Even if this did nothing for my skin, hair, and nails I would still consider using it just because of the amount of A,C,D, and E vitamins. If you feel like your skin care regimen could use &amp;#34;something else&amp;#34; give this a try! You will be very happy and surprised!</li>
            <li> I bought this products after reading the reviews and had high hopes for my dehydrated skin. I have used the whole bottle as directed, but was very disappointed. I saw no improvement in my skin whatsoever. I saw no evidence of the promised benefits in skin, hair or nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement daily and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are showing some significant changes! I rarely use lotion on my hands, because I wash them so often throughout the day that I don&#x27;t even bother. Unfortunately, washing my hands so much has chapped my skin. Sometimes, it&#x27;s so dry that it will crack and blend.. especially around my knuckles. Once I started taking this supplement, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands feel much softer and they&#x27;re slowly healing on its own without the help of lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d stop using lotion on other areas of my body completely, because I have mild eczema on my legs. However, I think this supplement is great and it has helped my skin! I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face has become a little plumper and looking a little younger. So I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This product offers a youthful glow with a quick pop of a pill. Fine lines are smoothed and skin is lifted without the need for any application of beauty products.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference.  I think if you are already taking the vitamins that is in this, you are doing well.</li>
            <li> Good but not the best value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using the product for 13 days, but I can see a slight difference in the appearance of my skin. My face seems much brighter (I&#x27;m African-American). And, I used to have a small dry patch on my upper left cheek which I can&#x27;t see anymore. Also, because the product claims to put moisture back into the skin, I did a little experiment of my own. I wanted to find out if I needed to put a moisturizer on my face after I washed it. So, what I would do is wash my face and pat it dry and I wouldn&#x27;t put a moisturizer on afterwards. Doing this for several days, I would notice that my face didn&#x27;t feel tight and that I could feel a very small amount of oiliness along both sides of my nostrils. And, I noticed that the skin on both sides of my nose isn&#x27;t peeling anymore.</li>
            <li> It seems it worked great and does seems to moisture your dry skin on face.  Well maybe I am wrong but does make my face look and feel better !</li>
            <li> I took pictures before I began taking this and again after four weeks.  I saw absolutely no change.  There will not be a reorder from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time and can&#x27;t believe how much better my nails and skin look. My nails are growing really fast and seem healthier at the base. My skin looks like it&#x27;s glowing and my hair seems shinier. I really like this product. I was hesitant to try it at first but am really glad I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin especially in the winter, my nails are also on the weak side. My nails split and break easily. I noticed after just a few days my skin felt more hydrated, i had less bumps on the back of my arms. My skin overall looked healthier.  After about 10 days I noticed my nails looked shiny and seemed to be harder. I would buy this product again as it give me a healthy look and helps my nails! I received this product to test for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I really think I can see a difference, and will order again.  Very happy to rate this product, and hope to see more of a difference in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Dr. Oz recommended it on his show. I&#x27;m going to give it a 5 star and if not pleased after 30 days, will come back and update.</li>
            <li> Has made a big difference.....Especially in my fingernails.  I take it every day and try not to miss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent. You will have the result after one week. Unbelievable! It&#x27;s my first time to trail and l love it so much!</li>
            <li> I have been a professional dancer and performer for over 13 years, and have trained under some of the world&#x27;s most renowned masters of the Kirov Russian ballet since I was in my teens (I am currently 31). On any given night, I would perform for hundreds to thousands of people at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dancer MUST look healthy if they are to keep working, and I HIGHLY recommend this product. Besides the obvious (and researchable) benefits, and the fact doctors recommend phytoceramides, it is FAR cheaper than other products which are THE EXACT SAME THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY, price aside (because all factors must be considered when one&#x27;s career partially depends upon looks), this company&#x27;s customer service is unbeatable. I&#x27;ve talked to the supplier throughout my course of ordering and they stand behind their product, and their guarantee, 100%. They are INCREDIBLY easy to work with, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend them more. There is no risk here... go with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any positive changes in my skin after taking this for a month. Today is the 30th day. I&#x27;ve had great results with a collagen supplement I take, but this product has me completely underwhelmed. I have another bottle (I purchased 2) so I will take it until I finish it off, and to be fair will update this review if it really wows me. At this point I can&#x27;t recommend it. Try Neocell collagen instead, it really works, even for mature skin. The cost is about the same too.</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is the best phytoceramides as it works wonders!  The Revive with rice has completely changed my complexion.  I have friends telling me my face looks younger and it&#x27;s only been one week since I&#x27;ve been taking them!  I don&#x27;t know if everyone will get the same results I have, but I would definitely highly recommend to anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> these work but give you diarrhea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week, so can&#x27;t tell anything at this point.  I&#x27;m hoping to notice something by the end of the month.  Problem is, I also started using a Vitamin C/Hyaluronic Acid product Dr. Oz recommends at the very same time.  Dumb, I know.  But I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started.  So if I do notice a change, I guess I&#x27;ll have to use both products forever!</li>
            <li> As someone with extremely dry skin (I have eczema), I can already see a difference in a little over a week. My skin seems more balanced overall. I frequently get dry patches on my skin, forehead and nose, but these are beginning to diminish. Now my foundation doesn’t cake on my face like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve noticed an improvement in the bumpy areas on my upper arms and thighs, too. I’m hopeful that I’ll see even better results in the coming weeks after the supplements have had more time to take effect.</li>
            <li> I am super picky when it comes to supplements, but I am getting to a point where I need to make sure I keep my skin moisturized. As I am aging, my skin is drying out and starting to wrinkle. I decided to try Revive and the first thing I did when I got it was gave the pills a sniff. I cannot take pills that stink. I also cannot take pills that have a bad after taste. These pills scored well on both accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ No taste or smell&lt;br /&gt;~ Makes my skin feel smoother (have not taken it for the full 6 weeks yet, but I have needed less lotion)&lt;br /&gt;~ Lines under my eyes have begun to disappear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ Must be taken with food&lt;br /&gt;~ Pricy (worth it, but pricy)</li>
            <li> There are insufficient amounts of phytoceramides.  Should be 350 mg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also vitamins:  A, E,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dr Oz name indorsing this product caught my attention.  It stopped me from checking out other products.</li>
            <li> After 60 days, using before and after photos; there are visible results of fewer wrinkles particularly the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles for almost $50, and took it every day for 2 months............nothing, no differance. I would never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Being sensitive to gluten, I need to be very careful about pills I take in. I am aging but still feel young so I want to keep my youthful appearance. I had been watching Dr. Oz talk about phytoceramides and the benefits they have. I wanted to try it out for myself so I bought this all-natural supplement. I have been using it for a few weeks now and the difference is remarkable. The Vitamin E has made my face feel so smooth. I do not have to use as much concealer so it saves me money in that department as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be giving the supplement the full six weeks to see a complete change, but there has been a great deal of change in the last couple weeks. The bottle lasts a month, as you only have to take one a day. I found that taking it with food does prevent it from causing a stomachache, and I take it with a full glass of water.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revive for a short amount of time now and I have to say that I am impressed. I have really dry facial skin and I never have high hopes for products because they only seem to work briefly, if not at all. Since I started taking Revive, I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. It is not only soft; the dryness is completely gone. I feel great, my skin looks great, and I feel refreshed. I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Contains vitamins which I already take.  Further, it contains only 40 mg. of ceramides, which I do not believe is sufficient.</li>
            <li> Been almost a month &amp; next to little change. Maybe a tiny bit around eyes &amp; that really is not a problem area. So at this point I guess I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. So many good reviews I expected something to get excited about. I will try another month to give it more time.</li>
            <li> After reading about this, and seeing the recommendation for Dr. Oz, I wanted to give it a try. My skin is very thing, hair fine, and nails thin and brittle. Probably all due to aging and medical conditions. I&#x27;ve just started on the second bottle, since it says it takes 2 full months before results are achieved, but already my nails are thicker and stronger, so I might be on to something.</li>
            <li> I only used 1 bottle. Maybe you have to use for a long period of time?? I did not notice any change.</li>
            <li> I use this as an internal assist with the anti aging cream and vitamin c serum I love it.  Susan</li>
            <li> I like it because  of Dr. Oz recommendations.  Actually have not used it yet. I do that some time. so I can&#x27;t really review.</li>
            <li> Have been using in combo with Aria Anti-Aging Serum and Moisturizer...I have been very pleased with results!  Folks say I do not look my age....great for aging women</li>
            <li> I have not used this product and will not buy any product that uses Dr. Oz as an endorser unless he specifically endorses that particular product.</li>
            <li> As a working mom, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that can help me with my skin, hair and nails with minimal effort. One of my co-workers suggested this product to me. I just got the product the other day, so it is too soon to tell whether or not I will see significant difference in my dry skin and brittle nails. I did notice that I had more energy when I took the supplements, so that was a surprise bonus.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  My skin did not change one iota, I sure as hell don&#x27;t feel any younger or look younger, my skin&#x27;s vitality did not improve; in fact nothing happened.  Total waste of money.  Again - should not be paying any attention to what Dr. Oz is promoting on his show, because his promotions change with the wind.</li>
            <li> It has been 30 days and have not seen any change with my skin.  I also used the Vitamin C serum as suggested on the Dr OZ show and neither made any difference on my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I just received it, and have only taken two capsules.  HOWEVER, I am very concerned about what is under the added sticky label that was placed over part of the original label.  ALSO - that area was cleverly hidden in the photos displayed on the web page when I ordered it.  I can&#x27;t get all of the sticker off the container.....so I may look for another site to find the complete package information.  I will review again after using it.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive when I received this order - the plastic containers and labels look cheaply printed, but I had such high hopes from all the responses that I overlooked them. I didn&#x27;t see ANY change at all and I&#x27;ve religiously taken both the bottles. I don&#x27;t know if I can return them but will check it out once I&#x27;m done with this review.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing but make me wast my hard earned money. I saw NO results, didn&#x27;t feel or look any different. I&#x27;ve stopped buying all of these supplements. I&#x27;ve came to the conclusion that they are all a bunch of crap and only a healthy lifestyle and moderate exercise is really going to show any results. Stop wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these phytoceramides because I noticed since I started dieting and working out my skin (especially on my face) feels a lot drier and I&#x27;ve been getting hard bumps along my jawline and a few on my cheeks. Hydrating a lot more seemed to help a little, but not dramatically, so I figured the right supplement might help -- and it really did! I took Revive phytoceramides for about 2 weeks before I really saw change, but my skin feels GREAT now, and sort-of glows -- the bumps are almost gone, and my face doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore. A bonus is that my fingernails which have always chipped and peeled at the ends seem much stronger, too. I will definitely keep buying. A big five stars!</li>
            <li> Like any product like this you have to take faithfully to notice a difference.  I did notice a slight difference after a couple weeks of taking as far as overall appearance. I am not the best at being consistent daily and missed a days here and there.  However, I do and still plan on taking this until all gone.  I did purchased because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it has shown any difference  on me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of products in an attempt to get healthier looking skin. From the sun to stress, everything in life causes damage to your skin. As I started to get older those fine lines and wrinkles began to really bother me. One day while watching Dr Oz I heard about rice phytoceramides as a recommended alternative to wheat and it&#x27;s other benefits.  When I found out all of the ingredients were natural I decided I had to try it. Let me just say, the results I saw in just a few short weeks were amazing. I love this product and will gladly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have had three orders and nothing, must not work for guy&#x27;s!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not order it again.</li>
            <li> A Natural Facelift! What can be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Phytoceramides” by ReVive is simply amazing. My wife and I have been using the product for over a month. I, at first, was hesitant but she was persistent and I gave in. Of course the having Dr. Oz talking about the benefits of Phytoceramides certainly helped in convincing me to give it a try.  I have to say that I am truly glad I did. From the very first week I began to feel the change in my skin. It was softer not as rough as before use. My skin is usually dry and at times irate but lately since using Phytoceramides it has become smoother. I also noticed that I am more upbeat, filled with energy and eager to get the day started. I love the fact that it contains natural organic ingredients rather then un-natural supplements and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this is an astounding product that I thoroughly enjoy and one that I am more then happy to recommend to all. Worth the investment many times over and I am now a life long customer of ReVive and “Phytoceramides.”</li>
            <li> This does not seem to work as well as the liquid-filled wheat phytoceramides.  I will be switching back.</li>
            <li> Awesome skin vitamins</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any differences, yet, but I understand it can take a few weeks so I&#x27;ll update my rating and comments after I&#x27;ve been using the product for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I took it 3 days in a row and it caused such ringing in my ears I had to quit.  Is this a side effect of this product?</li>
            <li> did not work at all for me</li>
            <li> I took the pills, but didn&#x27;t notice any real changes. They didn&#x27;t upset my system, so guess nothing lost except the money. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Took it for 5 months and did not see any difference on skin or neck. I thought it suppose to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; but this thing did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> My skin can be really horrible at times because I have both oily and dry skin. Sometimes it can be really frustrating putting on my make-up because of the dry skin, then at times my face is really oily. There are some creams that I have used in the past that has helped, but it only works a short time. I am excited about these Revive Phytoceramides pills because they work on the inside of your body and you are not just slapping something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for four days now and I can say I can seen some improvement in my face already. In my book, this product has been amazing already!</li>
            <li> My skin texture has definitely improved since I&#x27;ve started taking this product.  I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> So far the Phytoceramides have been good. Haven&#x27;t taken them long enough to see if they are going to work as advertised. Will know more later on.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was skeptical when my wife kept adding these to my morning vitamin regime. I get a lot of split cuticles because I do woodworking and my hands get very dry. I do use lotion, but it never seems to really fix the issue. She told me to hush up and take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been three weeks and I have to say I&#x27;m sold. My cuticles don&#x27;t tear like they used to and on top of that, my wife says I&#x27;m looking a little younger. She points out that my crows feet have faded. (I never really noticed I had crow&#x27;s feet, but like any smart husband, I&#x27;m going to take her word for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really watch Dr. Oz, so I&#x27;m not sure what he said about the whole thing. I just know that this product has worked for me, and I told my wife that she should keep buying them.</li>
            <li> did not do what it says to do</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a great example that it works and will continue to purchase it. If you don&#x27;t you will be missing out on some great results.</li>
            <li> As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed some patchy dry spots popping up on my face and on my arms. I read that you should start taking supplements for wrinkles at 30 to prevent them from developing in the future. I did some research on phytoceramides and its use with reduction of spots and wrinkles. I love things that do more than one thing in one pill. A lot of the vitamins/supplements I take are because they help more than one problem. I picked up some of this stuff a few weeks ago and I like it. My skin looks more dewy and radiant. It&#x27;s not that my face was dull before, but I noticed an extra glow since taking these. Now the dry spots are gone and that is a relief because I was pouring on oil and nothing was working. I’m definitely going to keep taking this.</li>

            <li> It was okay. .didn&#x27;t do as expected</li>
            <li> The longer you take these the more you notice your skin improving. Wonderful for spider veins. It takes a couple of months before you notice them starting to disappear. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a bit picky with my skin, you know no harsh products on my face etc, and have always had relatively good skin, never suffered from zits or acne, and have only really had to deal with dry skin occasionally. Anyway, I purchased this product just to see how it worked really and absolutely loved it. Within a few days, my skin felt fantastic, soft, smooth, hydrated, absolutely wonderful. Now I have absolutely no patches of dry skin which is amazing for me this time of year.  I would definately recommend this to everyone and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Made no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I saw no notable difference in my skin.  Like with other products endorsed by Dr. Oz, that I have tried, I reaped little if no benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months. I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin, but my fingernails are fabulous. They&#x27;ve never been stronger, I know it&#x27;s supposed to take at least 4 months to notice improvements in your skin. I&#x27;ll see what happens in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Ever since my wife had our third child she has complained of dry skin patches. She drinks loads of water, take a few other supplements, exercises regularly and up until recently used to teach aerobics and yoga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one week her dry patches are gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product for a few months and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible changes in my face I have noticed an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. My body is baby soft, which to me, makes the product worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not convinced with the first order that this product actually makes a difference in my skin.  I am ordering another just to see if does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought some Revive because I just turned 30 and I read that you should start taking supplements to help your skin around your 30th birthday. I was kind of skeptical at first when I read that. I mean, all the women in my family have amazing skin and my mom gets mistaken for a teenager, ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I asked my mom and she said that she started taking some supplements for her skin years ago. I didn&#x27;t know. I guess good genetics will only get you so far! She&#x27;s taking some vitamins she found at an herb store. However, she&#x27;s taking like 5 different ones. I didn&#x27;t want that. I wanted just one type to take every day. I am nearly done with my bottle. My skin looks amazing. It&#x27;s soft, looks more plump and the tiny little wrinkles around my eyes are lessening. I like that. I want to be like my grandmother and people saying I don&#x27;t look a day over 30 when I am 60! I will definitely be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> Like the ALIVE for women product better but these are okay.</li>
            <li> Not really sure yet. Im still using the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Revive by Dr. Naturel and received my order rather quickly.  I&#x27;ve noticed complete change with my skin.  For years, I&#x27;ve suffered from dry skin and red marks on my face.  Although I opted for cover up, it began to become pretty costly for me. I absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks.  My husband also noticed the difference and is requesting I order him a bottle.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.im seeing results in my skin.awesome pills.I would buy it again .Good price and oustanding customer service</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!. I have very long hair and my nails grow long naturally so of course I have been looking for a product to help keep my hair and nails healthy as I age! This was the best purchase I could have made in that respect. I looked through the previous reviews and noted that one or two made the comment that they saw no difference, I guess it just depends on the person. This product works great for me!  This is the second time I have purchased this product and I can say that its fantastic! My nails are stronger, my hair is shinier and stronger as well. If you are looking to boost the look and health of your natural attributes, buy REVIVE! It really works!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like these capsules as they are too big.</li>
            <li> I have been using this several months.  I have very nice skin because I drink lots of vegetable juice and stay away from sugar ( it makes wrinkles and spots ).  It seems to be working for me.  The price is right and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Works very well with keeping skin un- wrinkled.</li>
            <li> within 2 weeks of beginning the phytoceramides, I  no longer had to use the additional, heavy face and body moisturizers that I had been using all winter.  The micro lines on my face have disappeared, and to put it simply, I look younger, by about 5-7 years (I&#x27;m 33).</li>
            <li> .????? No results after weeks...</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked very well. I definitely saw some big improvements. My skin looks great. Also found another great product that works wonders for the bags under my eyes:*[[ASIN:B00NJYFTLE Oculift - Doctor Recommended Eye Serum for Diminishing Dark Circles, Puffiness, Bags, Fine Lines and Wrinkles.]] Highly recommend these!*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change in my skin. It seems smoother and more supple. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I still think my skin looks younger now. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related, but my nails have been looking fabulous, too.</li>
            <li> On time, used product before, label was sticky, but did not effect product.  I transferred to another bottle</li>
            <li> I love the product because it did everything it says it would do.  In addition, it has no side effects.  If the product worked for me, it&#x27;ll work for anybody because I react to many of its kind I took in the past.  It&#x27;s also very cost effective in comparison to botox and other injectable fillers.</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjuction with a cermide cream...my skin looks great .. By the way  I am 74 yrs. old</li>
            <li> i saw immediate results and i like this product. i really think long term it would do anyone great results.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this for the past month so far I can only it is okay maybe after a 3 month period I will a more evident proof if it really works or not. For now my skin is smooth and it seems like the wrinkles around the eyes is minimally less.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any different and used for several months</li>
            <li> I was very excited to come in contact with this product. I struggle to maintain my hair, skin and nails in good shape since I had gastric bypass surgery. I have lost the vitiman&#x27;s needed to keep my skin and hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I made a deal with myself to start my anti-aging routine after 25, so that I would be proactive and not have to worry about wrinkles and skin issues when I am older. So after I hit the mark, I bought these pills.&lt;br /&gt;In just a little while of taking them, I can definitely see the difference. My skin feels plump, smooth, and moisturized, even though I have had an issue with dry skin my whole life. My face looked better and I could not tell what the difference was until I studied myself in the mirror and realized that my under eye area looks better! This made my whole face look like it did when I was a teen. I am so impressed!</li>
            <li> You can read the claims yourself, but I can tell you I saw results within a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m now encouraged enough to reinforce the improvement with a little of my own effort, such as more water drinking and right eating - and less junk stuff.</li>
            <li> just ordered and received these. started them and even doubled up on dose for week 1. then back to regular dose. if i see anything i will report it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and I can tell a difference in my skin.  I like that it&#x27;s just once a day and is very easy to add into my daily supplement routine.  It has no smell and hasn&#x27;t caused any unwanted side effects.  Great product and I plan on taking it on in the future.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 months now and my skin looks and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It has truly changed the way I look.&lt;br /&gt;I know because people have asked me what I am doing!&lt;br /&gt;As I said, AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver...my brittle nails and hair is not stronger and shiny...my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I never thought about taking a pill to help my skin issues.  I have very dry skin and what call chicken skin on my arms.  After taking this for 2 weeks, I am noticing that my skin seems to stay hydrated longer after applying moisturizer and that the red &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my arms appears to be getting smoother and a bit less red.  I am excited to keep taking this and seeing results.  My arms have always been my week spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for my honest review.  The opinions above are all my own true opinions and experience.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Phytoceramide capsules and it was a good one. I notice no side effects. I&#x27;ve been taking the capsules for about two weeks and I do notice a difference in my skin, especially on my face. My moisturizers seem to be working much better, with no dryness episodes later in the day. I&#x27;m having winter problems with my nails, but they do seem to be getting stronger. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking as badly as it was a few weeks ago. I look forward to completing my trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and review.</li>
            <li> This seems like a decent vitamin to take, my skin is going through a lot of hormonal changes so this is probably not the best time to be reviewing but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made it worse! The only thing negative about this product is the taste, I can&#x27;t swallow it fast enough! Leaves behind a terrible vitamin taste that I don&#x27;t think anyone is a fan of!</li>
            <li> I was always wondering if these kind of products work, so I have been taking this supplement for a little more than two weeks, one capsule a day and I see a difference. My skin feels softer and smoother, more hydrated and radiant. I didn&#x27;t experience any fine lines/wrinkles reducing, but I still have 2 more weeks to go. I like this product so far, makes my skin and myself feel great which is very important during these cold winter months. Another plus is its a Gluten free product which may be important for some individuals. I received a product free of charge for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> First I must say if you put something good into your body you will get good things back. This definitely is one of the good things to put in your body and achieve results.  My hair skin and nails are/were horrible dry and brittle.  After taken this for only about a week I noticed a slight change in my hair. It did not take as much conditioner when washing my hair which was proof enough for me that I was/am getting results. I am very pleased I was asked to review and test this product.</li>
            <li> This product has helped with my skin moisture greatly! I generally have dry skin in the winter time (those cold winds don&#x27;t help much). I was skeptical about this product when I was approached to review it, but I figured, &amp;#34;What the hell, if I don&#x27;t like the effects I can just stop, right?&amp;#34; And so with my own advice I agreed and started to use the product right after I received it. I was very impressed with it. It made my skin smoother and look younger! Now, this may not be the case for everyone because everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to products so I would try this on your own accord and maybe seek medical advice, especially if you have health issues.</li>
            <li> I finished taking all the capsules in the bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any significant change in my skin but I did notice a slight increase in hair growth and thickness, it feels a lot healthier than it was a month ago and I can only attribute the change with the capsules.  I considered ordering another bottle to see if I would notice an improvement in my skin but I found out ceramides are found naturally in a lot of foods and have just decided to increase my consumption with phytoceramide rich foods and see what happens. I also found topical ceramides may be more helpful for the skin which is what I would like to improve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my 3rd bottle. Really seems to help skin</li>
            <li> Due to some skin problems, I tend to have skin that is dry and rough to the touch, so when a friend of mine suggested I check out Revive, I figured it could not hurt. I have been taking this for about a week now and one thing I didn&#x27;t expect was I had more energy. The combination of vitamins A, C, D and E may be there to help my skin rejuvenate, but it seems to be helping my whole being feel more rejuvenated. I&#x27;m really glad this is gluten free as well. I am over 50 years old so finding a good anti-aging supplement is a plus as well. I&#x27;ll keep you posted on the results in a week or so.</li>
            <li> When I got back from holiday my face looked dry and drawn, not really what you want when you&#x27;ve just been away. I&#x27;m not sure if was caused by the sudden change in temperature but I&#x27;ve had it happen before. I started taking these and I think I look much better, no more awful flaky skin so it must be more hydrated, phew!</li>
            <li> i love it  thank you so much never used this product before i would buy it again keep  it in stock .  :)</li>
            <li> I started using Revive about month ago. I have always had issues with my skin and followed a strict facial care regimen.  My skin was either too oily, too dry, too bumpy and now that I&#x27;m getting older crows feet!!!  I figured maybe I needed to start taking vitamins to improve my skin. I was happy I came across Revive.  And it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the creams I used in my regimen. So I gave it a shot.  I love the stuff. Not only do I look good but I feel good too.  After a couple days I started getting compliments on my complexion and my kids even told me my skin was softer than ever.  I even noticed my little crows feet by my eyes are starting to fade.  I go out the house with more pride because I finally have a clear face. I look and feel younger. I got my 20s glow back. Heck, I even got asked out on a date.  I&#x27;m definitly gonna keep using this.</li>
            <li> After taking this amazing supplement for only a week, I have noticed my skin feels much softer than before. I have been getting compliments from everyone that I&#x27;m simply glowing! My skin is healthier than it has ever been and I owe it all to this incredible supplement. I typically have combination skin making it hard to find a product that won&#x27;t either make my skin oily or dry certain areas out. The Revive supplement seemingly knows just the areas to target for more moisture. I feel much more confident about the skin I&#x27;m in thanks to Revive!</li>
            <li> I saw a review on YouTube after couple of bottles , nada on my skin, prefer neocell</li>
            <li> I brought another bottle of phytoceramides that work better!!  Saw some results but not nearly as much as have been tauted on Dr. Oz and other media.</li>
            <li> I did not know that this product has only 40mg and I have been doing more research and you should take 1 tablet at 350mgs so I am a little disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more right now!  I would not have guessed something is this easy and simple to use and it shows results already!</li>
            <li> As someone that suffers from dry skin like crazy, I have tried everything under the sun. Unfortunately, for me, nothing has worked. Revive on the other hand has made a difference. In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;m noticing softer, healthier skin, not just on my face, but my hands as well.  I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the added bonus of reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Being in my early 30s I&#x27;m trying to take care of my skin more, and have noticed some lines that I&#x27;m not happy about. Cannot wait to see them diminish.</li>
            <li> I can tell even the skin on my arms are not as wrinkled. My daughter said my face had a glow to it so i will keep buying this product. Yes it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> Hi! Good as a supplements.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a good product. I have used it for 2 months  and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This brand did not work for me I really wish it would, but i will try one more,,, just to make sure.  I will let you know after I try the next one.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks, but I am definitely seeing a difference. My mom can see it, too. She asked me if I&#x27;d been trying anything new because &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; was different and looking good! What I&#x27;m noticing is that my skin is clearer and that the tone is a little more even. This is helping hide the fine lines I&#x27;m seeing around my eyes and giving me a more wakeful, youthful complexion. I can&#x27;t wait to see what things look like a few more weeks from now!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. Period. If you are considering it, go for it. The phytoceramides are top-notch, easy to consume, and are JUST as good as any other brand at HALF the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the guarantee is iron-clad and the supplier will help with anything they can to make the customer happy. I had a question and they were not only extremely polite, but made me feel like I was a priority to their business. I can&#x27;t tell you how nice that is in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, cannot recommend more highly.</li>
            <li> Very surprised about this ... I kind of bought it on a whim.  However, I will buy it again.  My fingernails are much stronger and do not split like they used to (have done that most of my life - and that hurts).  And I think my hair is coming in a little thicker as well ... which is important to me because I&#x27;m getting older and still do color it.  I will be ordering another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Have the product a short time but seeing results already. Living in the desert dries everything out. Skin is feeling better already. Looking forward to continuing great results. Thanks</li>
            <li> Every woman should know  this product works,</li>
            <li> Saw products like this one on Dr. Oz, but I&#x27;m always skeptical.  Tried it and loved it!!!!  Fine lines smoothed out after using one bottle as directed!  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this one!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for my nails like I thought it was going to. I&#x27;m not sure if my wrinkles got any better or not. Things like this may take more than 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> excellent product, have repurchased because it works</li>
            <li> I believe this product is amazing and helped me with my finer lines and plumped up my skin! I highly recommend it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> No difference in my skin. Did nothing  for my skin. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a close friend who I had asked how her skin remained so supple and glowing. She recommended this product to me because my skin was dry and lackluster. I am only 25 and wished that my skin would show my youth instead of making other people guess my age around 30 or 35. I have tried other skin products and regimens but nothing that worked like this product. I started taking a pill everyday as part of my daily routine and after about two weeks I started noticing small changes. My skin felt softer but tighter. It was as if I had been slowly growing younger. By the time I had been using for six weeks I had made a serious step forward in my skin and overall look. I am so happy with this product and do recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> These really make a difference in your face, but a couple of days after running out I could see my face going back to blotchy and pale looking.  These make your face look bright, clear and your make up goes on nice.</li>
            <li> Now, I can not say with 100% certainty exactly how this product works, but I can give you the facts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking this product a couple weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;Since taking the Phytoceramides, my skin looks GREAT - healthy, hydrated, and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference during this time period was the addition of the Phytoceramides, so I can only assume that this change is what caused the awesome looking skin changes.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to review this product. I must say it is an amazing supplement, easy to take and seems to be working well. My skin is already feeling smoother with much less texture. I am also noticing a brighter appearance as well as a more plump look around my fine lines. I will definitely continue this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a month now and i can honestly say that my skin appears to look healthier and it also feels smoother. I have dry skin, eczema, and psoriasis and this has helped tremendously. I have tried everything on the market and I am impressed! I took these according to directions and increased my daily water intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Do not feel it lived up to the hype</li>
