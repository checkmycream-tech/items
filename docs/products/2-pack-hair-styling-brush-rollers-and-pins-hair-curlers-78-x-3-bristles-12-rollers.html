            <li> Just what my friend wanted</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO STAY OUT OF THE BEAUTY SHOP FOR A WHILE.. HA HA</li>
            <li> I have bought lots of brush hair rollers over the years trying to find the ones like I&#x27;ve used for 40 years and finally I found them from you!  Thanks so much I love them!  They are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> They stay in, stay in place and do the job. The design allows your hair to dry supper fast if it&#x27;s not too long</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found these I have looked everywhere for them.  Amazon has everything you want especially things you can&#x27;t find  anywhere else.  They are much better than my old ones.  The bristles are longer  and stronger.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect (exactly as listed) and the quality is great.  I have looked for these every where.  So nice to not have to buy multiple sizes just to get the size you need.</li>

            <li> The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled.  It suits the purpose for which it was ordered.  Definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t used them yet, but they are just like the ones she lost when we lost our home in a fire.</li>
            <li> My fine long hair got stuck in these and we had to chop my hair :(</li>

            <li> I needed these rollers for my 86 year old Mother.  She can&#x27;t get her hair to stay up on any other kind.  I&#x27;ve searched stores around my home for at least a year and never found any at all.  I searched for these on Amazon and found one set that would work.  Mother says they&#x27;re a little bigger around than she&#x27;s used to, but they work.  And that&#x27;s all she wanted.</li>
            <li> Had looked for them for a long time.  Had them when I was young and I got rid of them. Was so happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> too pricey, but I cannot find them in stores anymore and I wanted them, good product though.</li>
