            <li>I really like these better than any similar products</li>

            <li>So far the Creme Brulee is helping me manage and maintain a consistency of volume in my hair as well as the nutrients it needs.</li>
            <li>I have tried different products on my hair and none leaves my hair as soft as this one.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and in high Florida humidity it managed to control my usual hair</li>
