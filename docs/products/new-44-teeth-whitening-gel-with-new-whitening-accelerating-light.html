    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>this is the best whitening kit that i ever had.</li>
            <li>This whitening product works great.  </li>
            <li>, i use it for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;Really fair price.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase and would use again.</li>
            <li>i love the accelerating light it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>the light works great</li>
            <li>Perhaps after buying more of the gel it may work</li>
            <li>this product required a lot more effort than we anticipated.</li>
            <li>but I think that it lightens more and quicker because it is 40%</li>
            <li>I will never be able to use the product because the packing content was incomplete as delivered.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more</li>
            <li>Id love to tell u if the product worked or not</li>
            <li>just love this stuff</li>
            <li>Cannot skip days and make sure you floss beforehand.</li>
            <li>I need to get more of the solution, but As long as you use them as directed this is a great product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll continue to use the light with the gel.</li>
            <li>Junk is junk, cheap is cheap.</li>
            <li>I removed the strip in the LED light where the batteries sits in the device.  </li>
            <li>The light does not work.  </li>
            <li>and the light makes some difference</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the light makes a difference, but I will definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can use the light with any type of gel?</li>
            <li>No instructions for using the accelerating light were included.</li>
            <li>had directions had light and mouth pieces.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel any heat on your teeth from the light either.</li>
            <li>The goofy thing wouldn&#x27;t come on the first time I tried using it</li>
            <li>worked very well  and the accelorator light helped speed the process up even more.</li>
            <li>No problem, pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>so the batteries don&#x27;t press together and pass energy from between them and into the positive connector that powers the light</li>
            <li>The light does seem to make the whitening time much shorter</li>
            <li>If you are getting work done, just make sure to bleach early and wait an additional 2 weeks as the whitener needs to leach out of your teeth</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use</li>
            <li>but you have to be consistent with this product.</li>
            <li>but when I did my smile is much brighter.</li>
            <li>I would whiten for upwards of 30 minutes without the light and this cut that time by just about a half and the results are brighter with the light than it would be without.</li>
            <li>The product definitely lightened up my teeth a couple of shades and I use AND don&#x27;t use the lil light.  </li>
            <li>But after using the entire tube and sitting for 15 mins with a light in my mouth it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The next day when I went to use it, the light would not come on.</li>
            <li>So I really have no idea if this product works or not.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in color /:</li>
            <li>Who wants to do business with a outfit like that.</li>
            <li>I started to use the whitener light and all I got was a white dot on my teeth</li>
            <li>where the tiny light is it located</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for my whole family.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a gentle product and</li>
            <li>More trouble than it would be worth.</li>
            <li>Since it was purchased with the expectation of being able to evaluate the product in order to determine its effectiveness prior ordering more, it was a complete waste of my time and money (not to mention  a fraud).</li>
            <li>It came out of the box hard as a rock, contacted seller &amp; their great fix was to tell me to move the plunger back &amp; forth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t drop it, didn&#x27;t get it wet, the light just quit working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the light does anything or not, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This did not work and was a waste of my time and my money, go to a dentist for the sure thing.</li>
            <li>I let the vendor know and they emailed back with their apologies right away to let me know a replacement was on the way.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought new batteries in fear of wasting money and to find it doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I tried this, and it seemed like it would work faster and better than crest white strips or other strips.</li>
            <li>This product really works well to whiten your teeth, but please be careful not to get the gel on your gums as this stuff is strong and will irritate your gums and it&#x27;s not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>The only initial complaint was light thingy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a little flashlight, pretty simple to construct, one would think.  </li>
            <li>i mean it made my teeth  white on a whole new level</li>

            <li> and it was not what I expected.</li>

            <li> so I had to stuff a small square of tissue between the batteries and the door/cap to make it come on and off.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s annoying trying to get it working at first.</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> Ridiculous its hard as a rock wouldn&#x27;t move at all.</li>

            <li> hate it!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product works. When the package arrived, the gel in the syringe was so stiff it would not express out of the syringe. I let the vendor know and they emailed back with their apologies right away to let me know a replacement was on the way. It arrived in two days. Mistakes happen but how they are handled makes all the difference. The light does seem to make the whitening time much shorter so I&#x27;ll continue to use the light with the gel.</li>
            <li> The product definitely lightened up my teeth a couple of shades and I use AND don&#x27;t use the lil light.  I am very satisfied with the purchase and would use again.</li>
            <li> I tried this, and it seemed like it would work faster and better than crest white strips or other strips. But after using the entire tube and sitting for 15 mins with a light in my mouth it didn&#x27;t work. Perhaps after buying more of the gel it may work but I don&#x27;t plan on doing that anytime soon.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, was as described, along the barest minimum of instruction. No problem, pretty easy to use. Sadly I only got to use it once. The next day when I went to use it, the light would not come on. Switched around the batteries and put em back in. Still no light. I didn&#x27;t drop it, didn&#x27;t get it wet, the light just quit working. So I really have no idea if this product works or not. No way to know. I didn&#x27;t expect dentist quality construction, but come on, one use? It&#x27;s basically a little flashlight, pretty simple to construct, one would think.  And no, I don&#x27;t want to contact customer service and try to get a replacement. More trouble than it would be worth. Junk is junk, cheap is cheap.</li>
            <li> My teeth seemed to be whiter but I&#x27;m really not sure if the were 44% whiter and wouldn&#x27;t by it again</li>
            <li> I removed the strip in the LED light where the batteries sits in the device.  The light does not work.  I tried resetting batteries again to no avail.  I haven&#x27;t bought new batteries in fear of wasting money and to find it doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> this product required a lot more effort than we anticipated. we would not have bought it if we knew. thanks</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use</li>
            <li> Not really the results I wanted..</li>
            <li> Works really well and the light makes some difference but I think that it lightens more and quicker because it is 40% and I will buy it again when I need it.  If you are getting work done, just make sure to bleach early and wait an additional 2 weeks as the whitener needs to leach out of your teeth and they continue to lighten a little bit even after you stop.</li>
            <li> This product really works well to whiten your teeth, but please be careful not to get the gel on your gums as this stuff is strong and will irritate your gums and it&#x27;s not a nice feeling. I have no idea if the light makes a difference, but I will definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used the product as directed and it did not work and it was messy to use and taste horrible. The blue light was uncomfortable to have in my mouth against my teeth. I discarded product.</li>
            <li> excelente producto,  y calidad de primera,  y esta muy bien empacada para el envió, llego el producto en muy buen estado, a pesar de la distancia y el tiempo de envió,  excelente para un regalo y esta a muy buen precio</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in color /:</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results of this product.  I had my teeth whitened at a Dentist&#x27;s office about a year ago and paid $100.  I believe I have received the same results for a fourth of the cost. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I will never be able to use the product because the packing content was incomplete as delivered. It arrived without any of the whitening agent. Since it was purchased with the expectation of being able to evaluate the product in order to determine its effectiveness prior ordering more, it was a complete waste of my time and money (not to mention  a fraud). Who wants to do business with a outfit like that. Amazon, where is quality contol?</li>
            <li> I  already ordered this thing and trays with another gel but the gel is transparent I don&#x27;t know if I can use the light with any type of gel?</li>
            <li> I started to use the whitener light and all I got was a white dot on my teeth where the tiny light is it located it sucks and I freaking hate it!! total rip off........ I don&#x27;t say that often</li>
            <li> This gel does seem to work, however, you MUST be careful when getting it on your gums. It burns and turns them white (which goes away in a little less than a day, but makes them sore), so take care to not get it on them. I&#x27;m not sure if the light does anything or not, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This whitening product works great.  I am going to order more and I recommend it for my whole family.  I get compliments on my teeth all the time.</li>
            <li> This did not work and was a waste of my time and my money, go to a dentist for the sure thing.</li>
            <li> It came out of the box hard as a rock, contacted seller &amp; their great fix was to tell me to move the plunger back &amp; forth. Ridiculous its hard as a rock wouldn&#x27;t move at all. Id love to tell u if the product worked or not but i can&#x27;t even use the product i paid for. Save ur $$$</li>
            <li> i love the accelerating light it works perfectly. this is the best whitening kit that i ever had. i mean it made my teeth  white on a whole new level just love this stuff</li>
            <li> I receive the kit, but it does not come with battery, thus it never worked. I did not returned because it was more expensive send it bank to the supplier that send it to the wastebasket.</li>
            <li> I did try it , didn&#x27;t work well because i did 2 set and it doen&#x27;t come whitte ..Will not order this again sorry.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a gentle product and the light works great, i use it for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;Really fair price.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference but you have to be consistent with this product. Cannot skip days and make sure you floss beforehand.</li>
            <li> Just received this item. No instructions for using the accelerating light were included. I can&#x27;t rate the effectiveness of this item since the company didn&#x27;t provide directions on how to use it!</li>
            <li> I need to get more of the solution, but As long as you use them as directed this is a great product. I forget to use it but when I did my smile is much brighter.</li>
            <li> had directions had light and mouth pieces.  worked very well  and the accelorator light helped speed the process up even more.</li>
            <li> The only initial complaint was light thingy. The goofy thing wouldn&#x27;t come on the first time I tried using it so I had to stuff a small square of tissue between the batteries and the door/cap to make it come on and off. It seems like they made the compartment for the batteries too big so the batteries don&#x27;t press together and pass energy from between them and into the positive connector that powers the light so it&#x27;s annoying trying to get it working at first. Once I got it to work it did help the brightening process by a lot. I would whiten for upwards of 30 minutes without the light and this cut that time by just about a half and the results are brighter with the light than it would be without. You don&#x27;t feel any heat on your teeth from the light either.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was not what I expected. I can&#x27;t even use it because it didn&#x27;t come with all it was supposed to. Very disappointed because I thought I was getting a good deal.</li>
