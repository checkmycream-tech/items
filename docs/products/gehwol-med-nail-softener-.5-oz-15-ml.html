            <li>Great product</li>

            <li>Works well but not as effective as I hoped.</li>
            <li>strongly warn users for whom it works, to then stop using it!</li>
            <li>Be sure to take measures after this to prevent or heal infection after your self-surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Ordered for my aunt and really works great.</li>
            <li>Purchased this &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product to use daily.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and helps alleviate the pressure of the nail surprisingly quickly (noticeable lessening of pain within about six hours of the first application, in my case).</li>
            <li>now i can clean under the nail tips.</li>
            <li>It is not a cure, but it is a really useful part of home treatment, and a huge relief.</li>
            <li>It has softened the callus&#x27; on the tip of my toes where I can get them off pretty easily now.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Put that on first and give it a minute to start to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this was a mistake purchase at first.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it really did anything the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The toenails on my large toes were digging into the skin causing ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like it and didn&#x27;t think it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for ingrown toe nails that you can pull out the corner with an orange stick and get at it to clip it.</li>
            <li>I used these Nail Softner for my 3 year old son, it work like magic, after 1 week of appling the product two time a day, you can see how the ingrow finger began get less read, and his ingrow nail is gone.  </li>
            <li>Try a topical pain killer on it first, anything that ends with &amp;#34;aine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the pain along the sides from the ingrowing nails is completely gone!</li>
            <li>My feet have old toenails and it has been hard to cut them, but with this Nail Softener I am able to cut even the toughfest nail on my feet.  </li>
            <li>great to use the night before cutting cuticles.</li>
            <li>However, you know your child and as you will see in reviews, it worked for one Mom and 3 year old.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week, but so far I don&#x27;t see any changes.....</li>
            <li>Keeps your toenails soft.</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful in preventing ingrown toenails on my big toes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend using on young children, especially on fingers they might put in their mouth.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the 0.5 oz bottle will go a long way as you only use a few drops.  </li>
            <li>My old review is long gone.</li>

            <li> Ingrown toenails are a bit gross (and very painful), so without getting into detail I will say simply that of the many tools and products I&#x27;ve tried, this nail softener was the first that let me actually deal with the problem.</li>
            <li> I will dontinue to use this until the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> It really works on very hard nails!</li>
            <li> It has really reduced the pain of cutting my toenails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had applied the softener several days in a row and it was still almost impossible to cut the nails on my big toes.</li>
            <li> This really does help with cutting thick toenails.</li>
            <li> For thick hard to cut nails.  </li>
            <li> I know of no better product to ease the pressure of hard nail pressing into skin and then softening and cutting nail than this one.</li>
            <li> users who are using it for weeks and finding no softening effects, I am sorry it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> For the price it is quite a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this for ingrown toenail suffers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what I expected. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I experience ingrown toe nails and this product works great to alleviate the problem.</li>
            <li> My old review is long gone. I highly recommend this product for ingrown toe nails that you can pull out the corner with an orange stick and get at it to clip it. In my case I use it for two or four days and it becomes effective. By the second day, pain is diminished. By third or fourth day I can pull out the ingrown corner of nail and trim it. Be sure to take measures after this to prevent or heal infection after your self-surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly warn users for whom it works, to then stop using it! Your nails will turn to mush, versus preventing the next ingrowth. You have to catch it before it becomes ingrown again, or use this again to soften and trip nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For users who are using it for weeks and finding no softening effects, I am sorry it doesn&#x27;t work for you. I know of no better product to ease the pressure of hard nail pressing into skin and then softening and cutting nail than this one. I recommend you stop using and visit a podiatrist/doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some licensed manicure/pedicure pros will tackle the problem for you, just endure the pain. Not all will. Try a topical pain killer on it first, anything that ends with &amp;#34;aine&amp;#34;. So it might be an antibiotic ointment with pain killer, or pain killer for gums, etc. Put that on first and give it a minute to start to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using on young children, especially on fingers they might put in their mouth. However, you know your child and as you will see in reviews, it worked for one Mom and 3 year old.</li>

            <li> The product worked as advertised. Very happy with the results. I would recommend this product to anyone. Always happy&lt;br /&gt;with Amazon service.</li>
            <li> This product does not soften nails.  For the price it is quite a disappointment.  It eases the pain, but does not soften.  I give it one star</li>
            <li> This really does help with cutting thick toenails. As one reviewer suggested, it&#x27;s best to use it after a shower. I use it in conjunction with Burt&#x27;s Bees foot cream. I use the foot cream at night and wear socks, and my toenails have gotten a lot softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I tried this product, as it WORKS GREAT!  The toenails on my large toes were digging into the skin causing ingrown toenails.  I was at my wits end and was going to call a doctor, but I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try!  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The product helped the pain and allowed me to trim the sides.  I will continue to use it and hopefully the problem will be taken care of.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> For nails that lift up.  For ingrowns.  For thick hard to cut nails.  This product should be used after every bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my aunt and really works great.</li>
            <li> seems to soften the skin.hard area. great to use the night before cutting cuticles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like it and didn&#x27;t think it worked very well.  Saw no results</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week, but so far I don&#x27;t see any changes.....hope it may start showing some changes on my nails soon....</li>
            <li> It has softened the callus&#x27; on the tip of my toes where I can get them off pretty easily now.</li>
            <li> Please tell me how often I must apply before I try and cut. Did not work for me. I had applied the softener several days in a row and it was still almost impossible to cut the nails on my big toes.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a mistake purchase at first. Didn&#x27;t think it really did anything the first time I used it. Tried it again for an ingrown toenail...WOW!!! Relief in moments!! Takes just a drop or two. I do recommend this for ingrown toenail suffers. Won&#x27;t cure it, but definitely helps relieve pain and helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it changed my toe nail at all</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day since the item arrived (on time).  To date, it has done nothing to soften toenails.  I will dontinue to use this until the bottle is empty.  I would like to evaluate at that time.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes nails softer to cut</li>
            <li> This nail softener works perfectly. My feet have old toenails and it has been hard to cut them, but with this Nail Softener I am able to cut even the toughfest nail on my feet.  GREAT product.  Thanks/</li>
            <li> I thought this softener would soften my toenails so that I could cut them easier, but that is not what happened. I could see what would happen if I had ingrown toenails. It would have worked great.</li>
            <li> Used this product for ingrown toe nails.  Purchased this &amp; love it. Kept me from having the nails removed by my foot doctor. Saved me from paying lots of money to have my toe nails surgicaly removed.  But this product. It is a wonderful product to use daily. Keeps your toenails soft.</li>
            <li> This helps with calluses and corns as well as nails!  It has really reduced the pain of cutting my toenails.</li>
            <li> I used these Nail Softner for my 3 year old son, it work like magic, after 1 week of appling the product two time a day, you can see how the ingrow finger began get less read, and his ingrow nail is gone.  Great product¡¡¡</li>
            <li> Works well but not as effective as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the 0.5 oz bottle will go a long way as you only use a few drops.  Softens nails to make it easier to remove ingrown portions.</li>
            <li> works! the edges of my nails (across the tips) were adhering to the skin. now i can clean under the nail tips. the pain along the sides from the ingrowing nails is completely gone!</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful in preventing ingrown toenails on my big toes. Very easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
