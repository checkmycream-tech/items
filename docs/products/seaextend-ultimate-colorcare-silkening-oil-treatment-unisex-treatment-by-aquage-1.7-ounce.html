            <li>But I&#x27;m happy to have the rich...in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will buy again, my hair dresser call it &amp;#34;hair crack&amp;#34;, LOL</li>
            <li>This product is great for calming hair in humid months.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used of this kind.</li>
            <li>That is why I was so happy to read the product description for the aquage</li>
            <li>Great product, and guaranteed no silocone.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>It is very light and smells \\&quot;deliciously good\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Awesome to get rid of most of my frizz.  </li>
            <li>it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li>It smells good, and will make the texture of your hair sooooo nice!</li>
            <li>you should take care of it by purchasing good products.</li>
            <li>It replaces three styling products I used to use, and I am delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance too.  </li>
            <li>I like seaextend good for my hair</li>
            <li>My hair never felt so good.</li>
            <li>but this is still good for the silky texture.</li>
            <li>I have brittle damaged hair, but this stuff makes it feel perfect and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED it and works amazing and has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Smelled like men&#x27;s cologne kind of, but not in a good way</li>
            <li>I love love loovve it!!</li>
            <li>Product smooths exceptionally well and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic hair potion!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff 5 star rating from me.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li>This item was not what I thought it was, although it was nicely priced and arrived within the timeframe I was given.  </li>
            <li>Nice product for your hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Many have experienced good results with this, but I have a feeling that they are mostly normal hair textures.</li>
            <li>Personally, the silkening treatment is the best hair product I have used in awhile.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product....</li>
            <li>There is a way to close off the top so you can put it in a bag, but it&#x27;s not fool proof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, oils, etc</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this product...</li>
            <li>The great thing is that I used to buy it from my hair salon at a high price!</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair feel moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>Great shipper- product delivered before schedule date and wrapped really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>But when I bought my own bottle, I was less than impressed.</li>
            <li>I love it, makes my hair incredibly soft and works as a great detangler.</li>
            <li>This has kept my hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>I notice I less split ends between hair cuts which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>With this Silkening Oil Treatment, my hair dries more quickly than ever.</li>
            <li>The best part is it leaves your hair feeling light and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very light and might be good for styling, but one might want an extra heat protector in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your shiny, smooth, and it repairs any damage over time.</li>
            <li>I collect movies especially whole series with my prime membership</li>
            <li>Lanza neem plant silk serum is far superior but wanted to try this because it matched the aquage shampoo</li>
            <li>Tames dry and frizzy hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Very good hair product...doesnt weigh your hair down and doesnt give it a greasy look....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be really rich now.</li>
            <li>It does smooth the hair, but is full of allergens for me.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This oil smells nice and leaves the hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Basically, I think this is just another cone product that&#x27;s been re hashed to look special.</li>
            <li>It also works great to soften hair and reduce flyways without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Loved it until I discoverd an apple cider vinegar rinse (1 tbsp of ACV to 2 cups water) does the same thing for way cheaper.</li>
            <li>SeaExtend silkening oil treatment: \\&quot;with sea botanicals, ultra-light argan oil and sweet almond</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also convinced that this product made my hair shed much, much more than normal, with or without heat styling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always had nice straight, healthy hair, so it was the coloring (box OR salon coloring) AND going grey that robbed it of</li>
            <li>I went back to using Cowboy Magic detangler and Garnier Fructis smoothing milk for frizz control!</li>
            <li>Every time I left the salon, my hair always felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Most people with fine hair would think it would gunk up your hair or make it flat.</li>
            <li>&quot; I ordered this right away.  </li>
            <li>Controls my hair, does not dry it out, keeps it smooth &amp; frizz free.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;After coloring to cover grey, my hair developed a straw texture that didn&#x27;t respond well to blow drying or curling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several similar products for smoothing my hair, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>so it fits more easily into a travel bag unlike other squat product bottles.  </li>
            <li>It does smell wonderful; it&#x27;s used sparingly so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>This is an oil and when I first started using it my hair looked like a grease ball.  </li>
            <li>Firstly the bottle is itsy bitsy</li>
            <li>It would be safe to say the texture of my hair has changed over the last five years as well.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been told ;).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aquage put it all back and colored or not, I now use it regularly for a wonderful softness that you can&#x27;t get when you have REALLY grey hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is finally looking healthy and smooth and actually is shining again</li>
            <li>My hair is normally dry, but this creates a smooth, healthy finish with just a tiny bit of product.</li>
            <li>Arrived as described, shipped fast from store.</li>
            <li>I PAID MUCH MOR FOR IT.</li>
            <li>I use this treatment on second day hair to smooth my hair and restore the shine that can be dulled from hairspray.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really shiny, but does not reduce frizziness at all.</li>
            <li>Highly would recommend to others who have frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>but it really makes my hair shine</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to use a lot of this for real results.</li>
            <li>I can smell the argan in it, but don&#x27;t smell the sea too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have a couple other oils more in the Argan category</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t build up in the hair...washes out cleanly with regular shampooing.</li>
            <li>For my long, medium-thick, wavy hair, it helped smooth and straighten it well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying this size to start out, then, I bet you&#x27;ll love it so much that you&#x27;ll want to buy the larger size next.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked well as a detangler and the scent was enjoyable, but it was not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it didn&#x27;t really define my curls or smooth my hair very well.</li>
            <li>Mainly because of where I live, which is very humid.</li>
            <li>really like it and worth the price...would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft, and works wonders for static/fly-away hair!  </li>
            <li>Little better price.  </li>
            <li>it definitely helped dry my hair more quickly and left it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>This might be a waste of money because it&#x27;s mostly cones.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; easy to comb through when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>(I live in Florida.)  </li>
            <li>I destroyed my hair last year by using silicone \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; products, which at first made my hair silky smooth, but after several weeks and months left my hair more poofy, and also very dry and fragile.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I do like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I will get more when I&#x27;m out.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel really soft!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smooth and straight and UNFRIZZY my hair remained even in heavy humidity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that this stuff is so special, though, because the first three ingredients are cones.</li>
            <li>My hair felt dry on the ends and greasy on top (even though I was careful not to put any on my roots).</li>
            <li>After hearing people boast about this product, I finally got it, but I dont think its any better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li>But it does smooth if I just use a little it CAN be too heavy for fine hair which I have</li>
            <li>I will definitely make sure to keep a little stock of it in case it disappears from the market</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see that big of an improvement.</li>
            <li>My gray hair is soft and everything I want it to be.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair managable, it is not heavy.</li>
            <li>and I am considering going back to this because it is lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to create as much build-up.  </li>
            <li>my hairstylist raved about it so much and used it on me the last time I went in for a trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absorption is complete, leaving no residue or oil.</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very long, straight, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li>For an even better result, I mix in a little leave-in conditioner with the oil before putting it in my hair, since my hair is dry, frizzy, and chemically-treated (and would be totally gray if I didn&#x27;t color it).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several types of hair oil, having very frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li>This was disappointing because I was really looking for something very natural smelling and light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle of normal and needing extreme hair stuff.</li>

            <li> Controls my hair, does not dry it out, keeps it smooth &amp; frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;After coloring to cover grey, my hair developed a straw texture that didn&#x27;t respond well to blow drying or curling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several similar products for smoothing my hair, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> so it fits more easily into a travel bag unlike other squat product bottles.  </li>
            <li> It does smell wonderful; it&#x27;s used sparingly so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is an oil and when I first started using it my hair looked like a grease ball.  </li>
            <li> Firstly the bottle is itsy bitsy</li>
            <li> It would be safe to say the texture of my hair has changed over the last five years as well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been told ;).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aquage put it all back and colored or not, I now use it regularly for a wonderful softness that you can&#x27;t get when you have REALLY grey hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is finally looking healthy and smooth and actually is shining again</li>
            <li> My hair is normally dry, but this creates a smooth, healthy finish with just a tiny bit of product.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described, shipped fast from store.</li>
            <li> I PAID MUCH MOR FOR IT.</li>
            <li> I use this treatment on second day hair to smooth my hair and restore the shine that can be dulled from hairspray.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really shiny, but does not reduce frizziness at all.</li>
            <li> Highly would recommend to others who have frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> but it really makes my hair shine</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to use a lot of this for real results.</li>
            <li> I can smell the argan in it, but don&#x27;t smell the sea too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have a couple other oils more in the Argan category</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t build up in the hair...washes out cleanly with regular shampooing.</li>
            <li> For my long, medium-thick, wavy hair, it helped smooth and straighten it well.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying this size to start out, then, I bet you&#x27;ll love it so much that you&#x27;ll want to buy the larger size next.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked well as a detangler and the scent was enjoyable, but it was not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it didn&#x27;t really define my curls or smooth my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Mainly because of where I live, which is very humid.</li>
            <li> really like it and worth the price...would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft, and works wonders for static/fly-away hair!  </li>
            <li> Little better price.  </li>
            <li> it definitely helped dry my hair more quickly and left it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li> This might be a waste of money because it&#x27;s mostly cones.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft &amp; easy to comb through when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> (I live in Florida.)  </li>
            <li> I destroyed my hair last year by using silicone \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; products, which at first made my hair silky smooth, but after several weeks and months left my hair more poofy, and also very dry and fragile.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I will get more when I&#x27;m out.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel really soft!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth and straight and UNFRIZZY my hair remained even in heavy humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this stuff is so special, though, because the first three ingredients are cones.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry on the ends and greasy on top (even though I was careful not to put any on my roots).</li>
            <li> After hearing people boast about this product, I finally got it, but I dont think its any better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> But it does smooth if I just use a little it CAN be too heavy for fine hair which I have</li>
            <li> I will definitely make sure to keep a little stock of it in case it disappears from the market</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see that big of an improvement.</li>
            <li> My gray hair is soft and everything I want it to be.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair managable, it is not heavy.</li>
            <li> and I am considering going back to this because it is lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to create as much build-up.  </li>
            <li> my hairstylist raved about it so much and used it on me the last time I went in for a trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The absorption is complete, leaving no residue or oil.</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> For an even better result, I mix in a little leave-in conditioner with the oil before putting it in my hair, since my hair is dry, frizzy, and chemically-treated (and would be totally gray if I didn&#x27;t color it).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of hair oil, having very frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing because I was really looking for something very natural smelling and light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle of normal and needing extreme hair stuff.</li>
            <li> But if you have normal curly that&#x27;s not damaged and gets slightly frizzy, then this should be okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And having soft, manageable grey hair (using Aquage) allows me to have a wide range of hairstyles...</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair that has a slight wave to it and tends to friz easily in humid weather.     </li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real deal...  </li>
            <li> My hair dries faster and is protected from the heat of the flat iron I use every day.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to protect it from my hair dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> have long frizzy/curly mixed coarse/fine hair that poofs out unattractively when the weather is humid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that my hair eventually started to dry out using the One n Only products - turns out an ingredient in that product also has silicone.  </li>
            <li> no longer limited to short styles because longer styles go frizzy or wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> but if you use to much it will way it down a little but would def.</li>
            <li> and I plan to keep using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasted a long time!  </li>
            <li> Tames flyaways and smooths dry ends.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, you can either straighten, curl, or brush as is.  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry or  damaged, frizzy or curly hair, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and one pump is enough for my extremely thick hair that is nearly half-way down my back in length.</li>
            <li> In the past, I also had trouble blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair... softer and silkier after use.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that tends to get poufy and a bit frizzy, and this is the first serum that has managed to truly tame it.</li>
            <li> Use while your hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After destroying my hair last year, I don&#x27;t dare use this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> This packaging is nifty too because it is long and narrow</li>
            <li> The mid-last ingredients are a hodgepodge of other oils.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful with the amount</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and very thick.</li>
            <li> I put it down on a futon in my studio and it soaked through to the fabric and mattress below.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t understand how oil wasn&#x27;t going to weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> It is much less costly on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was a chore since my hair was so thick, and if I didn&#x27;t dry it thoroughly, I&#x27;d still end up with some frizziness.  </li>
            <li> back to normal :(</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and have to wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li> But after showering I apply a few drops and let my hair airdry or even blowdry</li>
            <li> I came on here and purchased a few...</li>
            <li> I immediately notice a difference in my hair if I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days.</li>
            <li> I put a dime sized amount in my damp hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure WHAT it is.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from salons in the past, and so I knew what I was buying.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount works.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Hard product to find</li>
            <li> AND I PAID AT LEAST $15.00</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a negative thing to say about it</li>
            <li> Five years at least.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the smell either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read online that this is a common result for people with my hair type who use silicone products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thick, curly hair and Aquage gives my hair shine and moisture.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested this and purchased this at retail price... very expensive, but I had to because my hair was getting really dry...</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle, I was very disappointed to see that the first three ingredients in this product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A little goes a long way...I have oily hair and have to wash it everyday.  This is an oil and when I first started using it my hair looked like a grease ball.  I do like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I will get more when I&#x27;m out.  I didn&#x27;t really see that big of an improvement.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel really soft!</li>
            <li> I started using Aquage&#x27;s Silkening Oil Treatment in the summer of 2010. I was surprised at how smooth and straight and UNFRIZZY my hair remained even in heavy humidity. I have thick, long hair that has a slight wave to it and tends to friz easily in humid weather.     In the past, I also had trouble blow drying it straight. It was a chore since my hair was so thick, and if I didn&#x27;t dry it thoroughly, I&#x27;d still end up with some frizziness.  With this Silkening Oil Treatment, my hair dries more quickly than ever. I have now been using this product for almost a year and am still as happy with it as I was in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Firstly the bottle is itsy bitsy and I was not expecting that and it feels like silicon which is not a sea product so I am not sure WHAT it is. But it does smooth if I just use a little it CAN be too heavy for fine hair which I have so I have to be very careful with the amount</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I love it, makes my hair incredibly soft and works as a great detangler. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great silkener that even adds shine. Amazing stuff 5 star rating from me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The price is excellent, compared to the salon prices. I have purchased this product from salons in the past, and so I knew what I was buying. Arrived as described, shipped fast from store. This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome to get rid of most of my frizz.  Still not 100% perfect but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of hair oil, having very frizzy and dry hair. But after showering I apply a few drops and let my hair airdry or even blowdry sometimes!Keeps the hair moisturized and shiny! Not greasy ever, either. It smells good, and will make the texture of your hair sooooo nice! Try  it! Definetly recommended! :D</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  I have thick, curly hair and Aquage gives my hair shine and moisture.  I recommend buying this size to start out, then, I bet you&#x27;ll love it so much that you&#x27;ll want to buy the larger size next.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my stylist. I have thick wavy hair that tends to get poufy and a bit frizzy, and this is the first serum that has managed to truly tame it. It makes my hair very soft and manageable. I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years for untangling my hair after washing.  Works great and my hair looks clean...not oily.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR GETS FRIZZY IF I DON&#x27;T PUT SOMETHING IN IT. MY HAIR STYLIST SUGGESTED THIS&lt;br /&gt;LAST YEAR. UNPON RUNNING OUT I FOUND THAT AMAZON HAD THE PRODUCT IN THEIR LINE UP.&lt;br /&gt;I KNOW I PAID MUCH MOR FOR IT. THIS ONE WAS ONLY $8.95 AND I PAID AT LEAST $15.00 SO I SAVE&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY.</li>
            <li> Controls my hair, does not dry it out, keeps it smooth &amp; frizz free. Does not build up on my  hair.</li>
            <li> Save my purchasing on line.  Just a small amount works.  A bottle this size last for months on medium length hair.  Tames flyaways and smooths dry ends.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real deal...  Feels different from the salon</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested this and purchased this at retail price... very expensive, but I had to because my hair was getting really dry... I moved to a different climate. I LOVED it and works amazing and has a very nice scent. I came on here and purchased a few... for the SAME PRICE I GOT ONE AT! Definite recommendation!</li>
            <li> This is like liquid gold for your hair.  My hair is normally dry, but this creates a smooth, healthy finish with just a tiny bit of product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser is the one who introduced me to this product. She would use it on my hair when I went in for a cut. After several times of using it, I had to have some. It makes my hair silky smooth and smells great. My hair dries faster and is protected from the heat of the flat iron I use every day. I notice I less split ends between hair cuts which is awesome. I can go longer between appointments now too. I bought the Aquage hairspry too but I am kinda mehhhh about it.  Personally, the silkening treatment is the best hair product I have used in awhile. I can&#x27;t think of a negative thing to say about it so I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is my third purchase.  I have fine hair and I have it highlighted so my problem is two fold.  Not enough body but sometimes too fly away because of highlighting.  I use a mousse and Seaextend silkening oil treatment and it works great at handling both problems!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Makes my hair soft &amp; easy to comb through when it&#x27;s wet. Smells awesome! Does not leave hair feeling greasy!!</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with your hair and want it to feel and look like silk, then use this. I love it. Even though I no longer color my hair (went to gray!) I still use it. My gray hair is soft and everything I want it to be.</li>
            <li> I use this treatment on second day hair to smooth my hair and restore the shine that can be dulled from hairspray. It also works great to soften hair and reduce flyways without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Five years at least. It would be safe to say the texture of my hair has changed over the last five years as well. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine. I color treat my hair blonde every 7 weeks. This has kept my hair shiny and strong. I immediately notice a difference in my hair if I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days. Most people with fine hair would think it would gunk up your hair or make it flat. IT DOES NOT. It makes your shiny, smooth, and it repairs any damage over time. I also combine  this product with the strengthening Aquage shampoo, conditioner, and Biomega moisture mist. They are pricey products, but if you are going to spend money getting your hair colored you should take care of it by purchasing good products. You are wasting your money purchasing Wal-Mart brand products on color treated hair. Purchasing these products on Amazon saves you money as well!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;After coloring to cover grey, my hair developed a straw texture that didn&#x27;t respond well to blow drying or curling. I&#x27;d always had nice straight, healthy hair, so it was the coloring (box OR salon coloring) AND going grey that robbed it of it&#x27;s great texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquage put it all back and colored or not, I now use it regularly for a wonderful softness that you can&#x27;t get when you have REALLY grey hair. It does smell wonderful; it&#x27;s used sparingly so a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t build up in the hair...washes out cleanly with regular shampooing. And having soft, manageable grey hair (using Aquage) allows me to have a wide range of hairstyles...no longer limited to short styles because longer styles go frizzy or wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d come up with the formula...I&#x27;d be really rich now. But I&#x27;m happy to have the rich...in my hair.</li>
            <li> i put this in my hair as it is drying. It makes my hair really shiny, but does not reduce frizziness at all. My hair is naturally curly and very thick.</li>
            <li> After reading about this hair product in a magazine, I decided to get it from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it.  It replaces three styling products I used to use, and I am delighted with the results.  It smells wonderful and makes my hair soft and silky. I will definitely make sure to keep a little stock of it in case it disappears from the market and I plan to keep using it for a long time.  I just don&#x27;t understand the discrepancy in price:  while I boutght it from this seller for $15.95, another seller is asking $91.80 for the same item in the same size.  What gives?</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair managable, it is not heavy. you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the results you desire</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product....it definitely helped dry my hair more quickly and left it feeling silky.  For my long, medium-thick, wavy hair, it helped smooth and straighten it well.  It also seemed to protect it from my hair dryer and flat iron.  I loved the fragrance too.  I have a couple other oils more in the Argan category and I am considering going back to this because it is lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to create as much build-up.  Also, this lasts forever! You only need a pea size.  This packaging is nifty too because it is long and narrow so it fits more easily into a travel bag unlike other squat product bottles.  There is a way to close off the top so you can put it in a bag, but it&#x27;s not fool proof.</li>
            <li> I like seaextend good for my hair</li>
            <li> Highly would recommend to others who have frizzy hair! Product smooths exceptionally well and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, oils, etc and this is the only product that delivers.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product... my hairstylist raved about it so much and used it on me the last time I went in for a trim. My hair never felt so good. But when I bought my own bottle, I was less than impressed. My hair felt dry on the ends and greasy on top (even though I was careful not to put any on my roots). I&#x27;m also convinced that this product made my hair shed much, much more than normal, with or without heat styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well as a detangler and the scent was enjoyable, but it was not worth it in the end. I went back to using Cowboy Magic detangler and Garnier Fructis smoothing milk for frizz control!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Makes me look years younger!!!</li>
            <li> The great thing is that I used to buy it from my hair salon at a high price! It is much less costly on Amazon. My hair is not colored ot permed, but this is still good for the silky texture. My hairdresser says she uses it on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Aquage Hair Oil on Saturday, November 6.  The outside of the bubble protector package was soaked in oil (the hair oil was not in a protected packing), but only on the bottom side, which means that I did not initially see it.  I put it down on a futon in my studio and it soaked through to the fabric and mattress below.  There should have been extra protection as the oil is pumped up without a stopper.    This is totally unacceptable and reprehensible.  DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR!</li>
            <li> Use while your hair is still wet.  Once it&#x27;s dry, you can either straighten, curl, or brush as is.  Tames dry and frizzy hair beautifully.  For an even better result, I mix in a little leave-in conditioner with the oil before putting it in my hair, since my hair is dry, frizzy, and chemically-treated (and would be totally gray if I didn&#x27;t color it).  I would never wash my hair without using this product afterwards!</li>
            <li> After hearing people boast about this product, I finally got it, but I dont think its any better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> Loved it until I discoverd an apple cider vinegar rinse (1 tbsp of ACV to 2 cups water) does the same thing for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product triggered my asthma after using for 2 days.  It does smooth the hair, but is full of allergens for me.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and makes my hair shiny and manageable! I use this every day and one pump is enough for my extremely thick hair that is nearly half-way down my back in length.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  Couldn&#x27;t understand how oil wasn&#x27;t going to weigh down my hair but it really makes my hair shine and I can go 3 days until the next shampoo.  I used to have to wash every day or my hair would be flat.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells nice and leaves the hair feeling very soft. Other than that, it didn&#x27;t really define my curls or smooth my hair very well. However, it&#x27;s very light and might be good for styling, but one might want an extra heat protector in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absorption is complete, leaving no residue or oil. Many have experienced good results with this, but I have a feeling that they are mostly normal hair textures. If you have extremely dry or  damaged, frizzy or curly hair, this might not work for you. You&#x27;d have to use a lot of this for real results. And this is he largest size, I believe (1.7 oz at the prices of $16.95). But if you have normal curly that&#x27;s not damaged and gets slightly frizzy, then this should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle of normal and needing extreme hair stuff. Mainly because of where I live, which is very humid. I&#x27;m not sure that this stuff is so special, though, because the first three ingredients are cones. The mid-last ingredients are a hodgepodge of other oils. I can smell the argan in it, but don&#x27;t smell the sea too much. This was disappointing because I was really looking for something very natural smelling and light. Basically, I think this is just another cone product that&#x27;s been re hashed to look special. This might be a waste of money because it&#x27;s mostly cones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several similar products for smoothing my hair, this by far is the best. I will buy again, my hair dresser call it &amp;#34;hair crack&amp;#34;, LOL</li>
            <li> This product is great for calming hair in humid months. The best part is it leaves your hair feeling light and not weighed down. A lot of products will leave an oily residue. It makes the hair feel moisturized and healthy. Great shipper- product delivered before schedule date and wrapped really well.</li>
            <li> I like the product for the cost it does what it says and is not going to break the bank.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Lanza neem plant silk serum is far superior but wanted to try this because it matched the aquage shampoo /condition I had.  Not thrilled with the smell either. Smelled like men&#x27;s cologne kind of, but not in a good way</li>
            <li> This item was not what I thought it was, although it was nicely priced and arrived within the timeframe I was given.  I was not pleased with the product itself. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product.  Makes hair so soft and shiny. Best product I&#x27;ve used of this kind. my hair isn&#x27;t colored but I use anyway.</li>
            <li> I have brittle damaged hair, but this stuff makes it feel perfect and smooth and shiny. I love love loovve it!!</li>
            <li> Every time I left the salon, my hair always felt amazing.  Then the next day...back to normal :(. I finally asked what they put in my hair, and I asked to buy it from them.  They hesitated but let me.  The bottle lasted a long time!  Found it on Amazon after that.  Little better price.  I have very long, straight, fly-away hair.  I put a dime sized amount in my damp hair everyday.  Does NOT feel oily!  It is very light and smells \\&quot;deliciously good\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve been told ;). Everyone who I&#x27;ve shared it with was hooked instantly.  Makes my hair very soft, and works wonders for static/fly-away hair!  It&#x27;s like magic hair potion! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Very good hair product...doesnt weigh your hair down and doesnt give it a greasy look....really like it and worth the price...would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Nice product for your hair but if you use to much it will way it down a little but would def. recommend it.</li>
            <li> used this along with the power infusion.  my hair is finally looking healthy and smooth and actually is shining again</li>
            <li> Hard product to find but of course not here. I collect movies especially whole series with my prime membership I can always add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I had used sea kelp products years ago, which gave me beautiful hair.  That is why I was so happy to read the product description for the aquage SeaExtend silkening oil treatment: \\&quot;with sea botanicals, ultra-light argan oil and sweet almond oil.\\&quot; I ordered this right away.  When I received the bottle, I was very disappointed to see that the first three ingredients in this product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cyclopentasiloxane, dimethiconol, and isohexadecane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in that order - all three are non-water soluble silicones.  The Argan oil, almond oil, and sea botanicals are fourth, fifth, and sixth ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long frizzy/curly mixed coarse/fine hair that poofs out unattractively when the weather is humid (I live in Florida.)  I destroyed my hair last year by using silicone \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; products, which at first made my hair silky smooth, but after several weeks and months left my hair more poofy, and also very dry and fragile. I&#x27;ve read online that this is a common result for people with my hair type who use silicone products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After destroying my hair last year, I don&#x27;t dare use this product. What a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan. 12, 2014.  I deleted my recommendation for One n Only Argan Oil. I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that my hair eventually started to dry out using the One n Only products - turns out an ingredient in that product also has silicone.  I&#x27;ve now been using the low poo/no poo routine and Curl Junkie products, recommended to me by a curly hair specialist in Gulfport.  Great product, and guaranteed no silocone.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I have very dry hair... softer and silkier after use.  I would buy again for sure.</li>
