            <li>Took 2 coats to get a nice even &amp;#34;Spring Mint&amp;#34; coating, holds up and got lots of compliments on it.  </li>

            <li>This color is very pretty and great for spring/summer.</li>
            <li>just looks so good and fresh! :)</li>
            <li>The swatches another reviewer posted are very accurate.  </li>
            <li>gelish is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Working in the beauty industry you are spoiled with being able to use all kinds of goodies.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this color</li>
            <li>It is more of a teal than a mint.</li>
            <li>It would probably look cute on toes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a darker mint, but I did also use three coats.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love the mint...</li>
            <li>I love the brand and color.</li>
            <li>The color is not as &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; as the picture shows but I still love the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite color for nails</li>
            <li>but I did 3 to even it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite polishes/color, if not my favorite for spring/summer.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments while wearing this color.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is more turquoise than mint.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a mint color I would recommend Sea Foam.</li>
            <li>So SO pretty!!!</li>
            <li>It cured beautifully under my UV lamp, and I will be going back to this color over and over again.  </li>
            <li>You can do so much with this color, love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to add this color to my collection!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect mint green.</li>
            <li>I like the brand a lot - affordable, goes on smooth, and lasts about 7-10 days.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, every time I put my nails under my UV light the nail polish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the time I kept it under the light, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to invest in a LED Light.</li>
            <li>Such a great color.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is thick and sticks perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The color was a little darker and more turquoise than I wanted but I am happy with color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun color and doesn&#x27;t wear off easily.  </li>
            <li>Very bright (almost neon green).  </li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I found it took 2 coats for full coverage</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so vibrant and appropriate for any office environment.  </li>
            <li>Mint of Spring is a pretty color of mint!</li>
            <li>The product is just fine andi t came very well packed.</li>
            <li>Loved the color got the nail polish sooner than expected ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>Does not look as green in person, but a very nice color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark, or too bright</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this item.</li>
            <li>, I have seen it take many forms in photos, but the swatch actually nails it.</li>
            <li>This was my first time doing an at home gel manicure.</li>
            <li>This color isn&#x27;t quite as minty as I had hoped, but still pretty.</li>
            <li>So pretty</li>
            <li>It is comparable to Essie&#x27;s turquoise and caicos color, but just a tad bit brighter, which is exactly why I got it.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color, but goes on very thick.</li>
            <li>far as the brand, Gelish is by far my favorite of the gel polishes, I don&#x27;t see myself using any other brand or paying for another manicure as long as Gelish keeps producing quality products and great colors.</li>
            <li>This color is more saturated than what I consider a true mint green, but that is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  no issues.</li>
            <li>The color was almost a light turquoise but not sheer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I love this color and the image pictured is actually verrry close to the actual color.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t apply as easy as some of the other colors</li>
            <li>I realized quickly to make sure not to get it on my skin and to do thin coats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice green, a little more &amp;#34;teal-ish&amp;#34; than mint, but definitely green.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars simply because the bottle I received seems to be a bit more watery than my other polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, Mint of Spring is a vibrant turquoise, more green than blue and the first across all gel nail polish lines that I actually like.</li>
            <li>I dislike about many blue and green nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a true mint green, but it is very pretty color, a cream shade (no shimmer or frost) and very durable.</li>
            <li>I love this color and have got many compliments on it, however, it dries weird under the drier and you can see little lines in the polish (if you look closely)</li>
            <li>I wanted something similar that would last more than a few days.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase, glad I got it but hated waiting a week to ten days.</li>
            <li>After retrying several times, I just took it off and got a new color.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>It will streak if you&#x27;re not careful when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>This green appears to be more of a sea foam green, I would say has a blue undertone and a creme be a creme color.</li>

            <li> This green appears to be more of a sea foam green, I would say has a blue undertone and a creme be a creme color.</li>
            <li> It cured very well with hardly any shrinking at all.  </li>
            <li> This color doesnt cure the same as the other colors I have.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, I have a several different colors, and this is the only one I have that problem with.</li>
            <li> This has only happened with two of my Gelish colors (mint of spring and garden teal party) but none others (I have about 15 other colors).  </li>
            <li> It does the the same with other light-brigth colors I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty mint green but the polish is very thick.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected... it&#x27;s a muddy, mint color.</li>
            <li> Peels too soon seems watered down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem was, but when the gel was painted on, it pulled into a small pool of color at the center of each nail.  </li>
            <li> The sweet morning dew from this collection is also very thick and extremely difficult to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li> and she said she got a ton of compliments whilst down in the Bahamas!  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a seafoma green color, this is your product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you like mint green.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this color in particular.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for it to be a little bit brighter and opaque!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the color that is in the picure unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The polish isn&#x27;t as thick as others in this line so application was a breeze.</li>
            <li> No matter how thin you put this on, it goes on goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> No problems with curing as others mentioned, but as always with gel polish, keep the coats thin to avoid wrinkles.</li>
            <li> There was shrinkage and wrinkling even when it was applied thinly.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it on my fingernails.</li>

            <li> gelish is my favorite brand. This color is perfect for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> I like the shade of this color but I was hoping for it to be a little bit brighter and opaque!</li>
            <li> Great color I use it often</li>
            <li> Working in the beauty industry you are spoiled with being able to use all kinds of goodies.  I love Gelish!</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a seafoma green color, this is your product. I get A LOT of compliments on it. I wanted to buy it in the mini size and could not find that. I did not rate this as a five because I am not patient in terms of waiting on things to arrive and did not want to pay the extra cash to have it rush delivered...it is nail polish after all. Good purchase, glad I got it but hated waiting a week to ten days.</li>
            <li> Peels too soon seems watered down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a true mint green, but it is very pretty color, a cream shade (no shimmer or frost) and very durable. Covers well in 2 coats. No problems with curing as others mentioned, but as always with gel polish, keep the coats thin to avoid wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is thick and sticks perfectly.  The color is just darling it&#x27;s so vibrant and appropriate for any office environment.  My daughter loves this color.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this mint color! It&#x27;s more of a darker mint, but I did also use three coats. Regardless, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spring!  It&#x27;s definitely minty and perhaps just a shade lighter than what this picture shows.  It&#x27;s a fun color and doesn&#x27;t wear off easily.  It will streak if you&#x27;re not careful when you apply it.  Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected... it&#x27;s a muddy, mint color. Definitely not the color that is in the picure unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty and great for spring/summer. I would recommend if you like mint green.</li>
            <li> New to geliah, very happy with product. Love this color, perfect for Spring! Fast shipping,  no issues. Very happy. Will from again.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, but goes on very thick. This color doesnt cure the same as the other colors I have. Not sure why, I have a several different colors, and this is the only one I have that problem with.</li>
            <li> Love love love the mint... So pretty</li>
            <li> This nail polish came on time and was undamaged. I love the brand and color. The color is not as &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; as the picture shows but I still love the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Mint of Spring is a pretty color of mint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to add this color to my collection! It&#x27;s a great shade  - it looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite color for nails</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for this item. It is just wath I wanted. The product is just fine andi t came very well packed. I will recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this color and the image pictured is actually verrry close to the actual color. You can do so much with this color, love!</li>
            <li> ...but I love it anyway!  It&#x27;s a very nice green, a little more &amp;#34;teal-ish&amp;#34; than mint, but definitely green.  The swatches another reviewer posted are very accurate.  I found it took 2 coats for full coverage but I did 3 to even it out a bit more.  It cured very well with hardly any shrinking at all.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Goes on very nicely and no bubbling like some others. My Clients are very happy with this color. A must get!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> This is an adorably beautiful turquoise polish-vibrant and creamy!! It is perfect for spring/summer and reminds me of being on the beach.  I found the gel polish to be a very nice, medium-thick consistency, which made it perfect for application as it does not streak.  You could even get away with one coat.  It cured beautifully under my UV lamp, and I will be going back to this color over and over again.  It is comparable to Essie&#x27;s turquoise and caicos color, but just a tad bit brighter, which is exactly why I got it.  I wanted something similar that would last more than a few days.  I&#x27;ve already been stopped by women who want to know the name of this polish. One of my favorite polishes/color, if not my favorite for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> I would give this a no star if I had a choice.  Very bright (almost neon green).  Also, I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the quality of Gelish...lots of retracting of polish when applied.  No matter how thin you put this on, it goes on goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments while wearing this color.  It&#x27;s a great Spring or Summer look.  The polish isn&#x27;t as thick as others in this line so application was a breeze. The color was almost a light turquoise but not sheer.  Absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem was, but when the gel was painted on, it pulled into a small pool of color at the center of each nail.  This has only happened with two of my Gelish colors (mint of spring and garden teal party) but none others (I have about 15 other colors).  After retrying several times, I just took it off and got a new color.</li>
            <li> So SO pretty!!! Looks fantastic on, this is one of the best brand of polishes I have found.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong the color is amazing. HOWEVER, every time I put my nails under my UV light the nail polish wrinkles. It does the the same with other light-brigth colors I have. I thought it was the time I kept it under the light, but it&#x27;s not. Maybe I need to invest in a LED Light.</li>
            <li> This green appears to be more of a sea foam green, I would say has a blue undertone and a creme be a creme color.</li>
            <li> OMG! This color is wonderful! Took 2 coats to get a nice even &amp;#34;Spring Mint&amp;#34; coating, holds up and got lots of compliments on it.  Did an accent nail in white with silver glitter with these. Did my girlfriend&#x27;s nails in this combo the day before her cruise and she said she got a ton of compliments whilst down in the Bahamas!  GREAT color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty mint green but the polish is very thick. I have over 100 colors from Gelish and this is he thickest. The sweet morning dew from this collection is also very thick and extremely difficult to get an even coverage. They both shrink and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> The color was a little darker and more turquoise than I wanted but I am happy with color. I would say it is more turquoise than mint. If you want more of a mint color I would recommend Sea Foam.</li>
            <li> Does not look as green in person, but a very nice color.</li>
            <li> There was shrinkage and wrinkling even when it was applied thinly.  Started peeling with in 5 days.</li>
            <li> This color is more saturated than what I consider a true mint green, but that is what I wanted. I&#x27;ve never bought Gelish&#x27;s Sea Foam because it looked like chewed gum to me. However, Mint of Spring is a vibrant turquoise, more green than blue and the first across all gel nail polish lines that I actually like. It&#x27;s not too dark, or too bright and it definitely does not have that chewed gum look I dislike about many blue and green nail polishes.  I&#x27;ve gotten loads of compliments on this color.</li>
            <li> Such a great color. Didn&#x27;t apply as easy as some of the other colors but i made it work! Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this color and have got many compliments on it, however, it dries weird under the drier and you can see little lines in the polish (if you look closely)</li>
