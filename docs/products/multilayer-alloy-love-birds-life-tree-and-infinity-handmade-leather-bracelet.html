            <li> The low rating was due to the clasp breaking after about two days of wear.  </li>
            <li> Not really, I thought the pic looked like 5 separate bracelets.  </li>
            <li> wore it 1 time and it caught on something, didnt even get pulled hard and the clasp broke off, dont bother</li>
