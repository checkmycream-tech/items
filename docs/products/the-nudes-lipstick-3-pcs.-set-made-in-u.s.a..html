            <li>I bought these for the lighter, nude colors, but the light ones are sparkly and really bright and look like they&#x27;d glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>(the light ones are supposed to be light, but using a lip liner in a similar color will get you a lighter shade at full coverage if thats what you want.)</li>

            <li>The two dark colors are ok, but I bought this package for the nudes and had to throw them out.</li>
            <li>Decent pigment in the medium to darker colors</li>

            <li> I bought these for the lighter, nude colors, but the light ones are sparkly and really bright and look like they&#x27;d glow in the dark. They&#x27;re horrible.
