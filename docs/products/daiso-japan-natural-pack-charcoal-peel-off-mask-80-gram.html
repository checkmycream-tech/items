            <li>The product works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase,</li>
            <li>Very nice with Good ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li>Great cheap peel off mask!</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so satisfying to peel off the mask and look at all the stuff that came out of my pores!</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing when I peel it off and stays that way for days.</li>
            <li>My pores look amazing and this mask pulls all the junk out of your face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay but not as good as the bior&amp;egrave; strip I used to get.</li>
            <li>My product came in before the estimated time and Dream Plan gave me some nice Oriduru with my purchase.</li>
            <li>For me it honestly pulled out WAY more hairs than blackheads</li>
            <li>wow, this is wonderful and so much better than the nose strips.</li>
            <li>Very good,  it really clear the face</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found out about it and started using it.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>but i guess its ok</li>
            <li>Worked really well for my husband, we followed this with a bior&amp;egrave; strip and had good results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to peel off without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li>Pore strips work better, but this is still fun, cute packaging</li>
            <li>Save for making me look like I am in black face, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and did nut have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>But it does speak to the Korean makeup trend right now, so if you are putting together a basket as a gift, I suggest including it because it is kind of cool to use.</li>
            <li>And has light smell, after I smelled it for 20</li>
            <li>, my nose didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I honestly felt like I waxed my whole face</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin so smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>Skin is softer but does not minimize Pours or clean them.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic though, some mild discomfort when removing it</li>
            <li>The product is good, but I wish there were some instructions in English as well</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This Charcoal Peel off mask really works!!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>and I read other reviews that it hurt more and tugs on your skin more</li>
            <li>Pretty neat.</li>
            <li>Was a gift and really like it!</li>
            <li>Make sure it dries totally before removing.</li>
            <li>My pores were visibly cleaner after the first application.</li>
            <li>so far it works for me, my skin became smooth afterwords</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a biore pore strip for your whole face!</li>
            <li>It pulls *everything* out of every pore and leaves your skin soft and smooth for days.</li>
            <li>This product did not seem to do anything positive for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had blackheads, for as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never been able to find something to strip them out.</li>
            <li>So gentle that at first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, but when I looked at the strip...</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t near a Diaso, or your diaso is out of stock... not bad to pick up on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s rather gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;peeling might hurt if you&#x27;re not use to pulling baby hair off your face (haha)</li>
            <li>didnt really workfor me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that this is doing anything.</li>
            <li>This really does help remove black heads much better than a pore strip.</li>
            <li>This one works better than the black one.</li>
            <li>No English instructing but pretty straight forward mask.</li>
            <li>but I find myself using it twice in one day in order to clear my nose.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>This face cream works so well, and leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s not harsh on my face at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my nose skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice and can&#x27;t say much about whether it cleaned my pores or not 100%.</li>
            <li>husband applied the mask in a thick layer over his nose hoping to get better results, and the mask removed about 1 square centimeter of skin from his nose when he peeled it off according to the instructions.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, had to apply it a second time around my nostril area to get rid of some left over gunk in my pores.</li>
            <li>I usually leave it on for about 45 minutes to an hour to make sure it&#x27;s totally dry.</li>
            <li>Like a giant biore strip for your face, even gets the small fine peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li>Was way to peel off and left my skin feeling soft, although it did pull out any hair</li>
            <li>Though, it seems to take far longer to dry</li>
            <li>Works pretty well but make sure you put on one thick layer instead of multiple thin ones or it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>

            <li> Though, it seems to take far longer to dry</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but make sure you put on one thick layer instead of multiple thin ones or it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> and you have to make sure you get the whole area with a fairly thick amount or else it will dry really thin</li>
            <li> When you use it make sure the edges of the mask are evenly coated and not too thin, otherwise you may up with little bits of the mask</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not water soluble, so it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands, and the mixture is very runny and watery.</li>
            <li> but it could be different for other people.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it drys like a paper, unlike some other facial mask that drys to be rubbery</li>
            <li> Other than not getting big ones, it works!!</li>
            <li> If you have residue (ones you didn&#x27;t peel off), washing those off was not as easy as regular facial wash, but not too bad, just took a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> It burns a bit and takes forever to dry and then feels like I&#x27;m ripping my skin off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work if not applied in a thicknlayer, and it takes a while to dry, but it did wonders for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> It works enough to get small blackheads out, but not the big ones!</li>
            <li> This really helps reduce my blackheads, and it isn&#x27;t irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> Once dried and you pulled it off you can SEE ALL THE WHITE HEADS ON THE MASK! -</li>
            <li> Except it pulled more eyebrows out then it did blackhead. :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> but the English writing is so small font).  </li>
            <li> It says to peel it off after 10 minutes, but at that point it&#x27;s still very wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> the bottle itself came half empty</li>
            <li> Need multiple layers to work which is a down because the bottle is so small.</li>
            <li> the feel of it was less then from a nose strip but does the job takes a little while to dry though</li>
            <li> not useful to take blackhead out</li>
            <li> I cannot string the words together to express my adoration for this product, it came fast and there was nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> It goes on looking like latex and dries to a matte black.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t keep it stored for too long because it loses its effectiveness</li>
            <li> It did remove some things, but really little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It still sticks to your skin after pulling the dried mask, so follow up with toner.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s on purpose or not?</li>
            <li> Overall, just weird and ineffective.</li>
            <li> which is main reason I bought this item for.&lt;br /&gt;Little bit frustrated</li>
            <li> Not effective at removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the other expensive brand but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> then it says, that is the only bad thing</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me when I tried patch test for thin layer then thick layer in anther area.</li>
            <li> The formula creates a bubble over any blemish and does not stick to that area when using a thin layer, as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I pulled it off no WHITE HEADS, OR IMPURITIES CAME OFF :-(!!  </li>
            <li> Though it is a peel off mask as described, it&#x27;s very thin and did not remove any impurities.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to peel and was an all around disappointment. :(</li>
            <li> (and is it really bad) about it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This really helps reduce my blackheads, and it isn&#x27;t irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very awesome stuff. Except it pulled more eyebrows out then it did blackhead. :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay but not as good as the bior&amp;egrave; strip I used to get. It removes some blackheads but not enough. I know you&#x27;re only supposed to use it a couple times a week but I find myself using it twice in one day in order to clear my nose.</li>
            <li> Bought it month ago, I used it once on my nose. It did remove some things, but really little. And has light smell, after I smelled it for 20 minutes(that&#x27;s the time I pulled it off), my nose didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> My product came in before the estimated time and Dream Plan gave me some nice Oriduru with my purchase. The product works great and it&#x27;s easy to peel off without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. No English instructing but pretty straight forward mask. Need multiple layers to work which is a down because the bottle is so small. Will try charcoal soap instead. Skin is softer but does not minimize Pours or clean them.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but make sure you put on one thick layer instead of multiple thin ones or it won&#x27;t work as well. For me it honestly pulled out WAY more hairs than blackheads but it could be different for other people. I honestly felt like I waxed my whole face</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for your face. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> got this so I would save money on buying nose strips and I read other reviews that it hurt more and tugs on your skin more but it does the job I will say for me the feel of it was less then from a nose strip but does the job takes a little while to dry though and you have to make sure you get the whole area with a fairly thick amount or else it will dry really thin and it wont come off in one swoop</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer I felt&lt;br /&gt;But not useful to take blackhead out which is main reason I bought this item for.&lt;br /&gt;Little bit frustrated</li>
            <li> Pretty neat. It makes my face feel soft afterwards. It still sticks to your skin after pulling the dried mask, so follow up with toner.</li>
            <li> I cannot string the words together to express my adoration for this product, it came fast and there was nothing wrong. It came to me as said on here. The product works on my skin and removes a lot of the dirt and and stuff like that. It&#x27;s a good product, I would buy this again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all impressed. I&#x27;m used to the other expensive brand but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Though it is a peel off mask as described, it&#x27;s very thin and did not remove any impurities. It didn&#x27;t pull or hurt my skin when removing but it also did not remove anything.</li>
            <li> Try nose strips you will see actual results. This did nothing for me when I tried patch test for thin layer then thick layer in anther area.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but I wish there were some instructions in English as well so I know I&#x27;m using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Very good,  it really clear the face</li>
            <li> Was a gift and really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It went on smoothly and did nut have a strong odor. Was way to peel off and left my skin feeling soft, although it did pull out any hair it came in contact with. It goes on looking like latex and dries to a matte black.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my husband, we followed this with a bior&amp;egrave; strip and had good results.</li>
            <li> Very nice with Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> This face cream works so well, and leaves my skin feeling so soft. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase, definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work if not applied in a thicknlayer, and it takes a while to dry, but it did wonders for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> This really does help remove black heads much better than a pore strip.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOOVE this mask. I look forward to using it once a week. My skin feels amazing when I peel it off and stays that way for days. It&#x27;s worth the price and I am so glad I found out about it and started using it. My pores look amazing and this mask pulls all the junk out of your face. You will love it. Make sure it dries totally before removing. I usually leave it on for about 45 minutes to an hour to make sure it&#x27;s totally dry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. I&#x27;ve tried those pore strips, and they&#x27;ve never worked for me. I&#x27;ve always had blackheads, for as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never been able to find something to strip them out. Well, my search has ended... this stuff is the real deal. It&#x27;s so satisfying to peel off the mask and look at all the stuff that came out of my pores! I have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s not harsh on my face at all. In fact, it&#x27;s rather gentle. So gentle that at first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, but when I looked at the strip...well, there it was. This stuff is so awesome, I&#x27;m glad I have it a shot!</li>
            <li> the bottle itself came half empty and i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s on purpose or not? The product itself is fantastic though, some mild discomfort when removing it but otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> Great cheap peel off mask! Like a giant biore strip for your face, even gets the small fine peach fuzz.  This IS cheaper at Daiso, only $1.50 but if you aren&#x27;t near a Diaso, or your diaso is out of stock... not bad to pick up on Amazon.  Worth the price</li>
            <li> wow, this is wonderful and so much better than the nose strips. i use it twice weekly on my nose and cheeks and all blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, had to apply it a second time around my nostril area to get rid of some left over gunk in my pores. My pores were visibly cleaner after the first application. When you use it make sure the edges of the mask are evenly coated and not too thin, otherwise you may up with little bits of the mask left over.</li>
            <li> so far it works for me, my skin became smooth afterwords&lt;br /&gt;it drys like a paper, unlike some other facial mask that drys to be rubbery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***WARNING***&lt;br /&gt;peeling might hurt if you&#x27;re not use to pulling baby hair off your face (haha)</li>
            <li> It works enough to get small blackheads out, but not the big ones! Other than not getting big ones, it works!!</li>
            <li> Alright, you guys- this stuff is freakin&#x27; amaze-balls. Though, it seems to take far longer to dry then it says, that is the only bad thing (and is it really bad) about it. This stuff makes my skin so smooth and even toned. Save for making me look like I am in black face, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Pore strips work better, but this is still fun, cute packaging and it does work somewhat. Still, I would not buy it again. But it does speak to the Korean makeup trend right now, so if you are putting together a basket as a gift, I suggest including it because it is kind of cool to use. This one works better than the black one.</li>
            <li> didnt really workfor me but i guess its ok</li>
            <li> Great product! Have seen a big difference in my skin since I started using this product</li>
            <li> It works well. Makes my nose skin soft.  I didn&#x27;t realize it is just for the nose area and put it all over my face (I think I read it afterwards about the nose area but the English writing is so small font).  I don&#x27;t think it hurt my skin anyway.  The only thing is I thought it was thicker after drying up but it is not.  If you have residue (ones you didn&#x27;t peel off), washing those off was not as easy as regular facial wash, but not too bad, just took a bit longer.  I have only used it twice and can&#x27;t say much about whether it cleaned my pores or not 100%.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that this is doing anything. It burns a bit and takes forever to dry and then feels like I&#x27;m ripping my skin off. It says to peel it off after 10 minutes, but at that point it&#x27;s still very wet and sticky. It&#x27;s not water soluble, so it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands, and the mixture is very runny and watery. Overall, just weird and ineffective.</li>
            <li> This Charcoal Peel off mask really works!! This is not the 1st. time I use it!! Once dried and you pulled it off you can SEE ALL THE WHITE HEADS ON THE MASK! - BUT THERE&#x27;S SOMETHING YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS MASK,  don&#x27;t keep it stored for too long because it loses its effectiveness and when you applied it on my face all I could see was air bubbles and when I pulled it off no WHITE HEADS, OR IMPURITIES CAME OFF :-(!!  But if you use it every week you will see and feel the results.</li>
            <li> Not effective at removing blackheads. As it dries. The formula creates a bubble over any blemish and does not stick to that area when using a thin layer, as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband applied the mask in a thick layer over his nose hoping to get better results, and the mask removed about 1 square centimeter of skin from his nose when he peeled it off according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked at cleaning out my pores. Better than the expensive stuff I had been using</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to do anything positive for my skin. Blackheads looked bigger and darker after I used it. It was difficult to peel and was an all around disappointment. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a biore pore strip for your whole face! Also, it might give you a bit of a waxing, too. Be prepared for a bit of pain when pulling this off if you have peach fuzz. But it&#x27;s so worth it! It pulls *everything* out of every pore and leaves your skin soft and smooth for days. I&#x27;m on my third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be warned that the texture is like tar and you will need to scrub your nails afterwards. I got around this by applying it with a foundation brush.</li>
