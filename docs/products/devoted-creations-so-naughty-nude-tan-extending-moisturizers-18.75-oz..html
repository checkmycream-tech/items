            <li>I loved getting it so quickly!</li>
            <li>Smells good and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good stuff smells great and makes your skin very soft</li>
            <li>THE SMELL OF IT IS GREAT, THE TEXTURE OF IT IS JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li>It really makes me feel beautiful and does extend my tan...</li>
            <li>I love the products, they do dxactly what the manufacturer says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Does an absolute great job extending my tan.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I can´t use many lotions with fragrance because I get a headache</li>
            <li>I thought this was more of a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>It was priced really well on Amazon and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My wife and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I, personally, LOVE.</li>
            <li>So... it comes off as a sexy lotion, and because of the price it should be descent.</li>
            <li>The smell is sexy, and the lotion has added diamond shimmers to make your skin glow.</li>
            <li>The bottle is just too cute on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>salon price more than I wanted to pay..</li>
            <li>Perfect for the long winters when I&#x27;m dying for a hint of sunkissed skin!</li>
            <li>This product really helps keep your tan looking great, I use it even for when I am tanning outside, smells great too.</li>
            <li>First off, it smells AMAZING and the bottle looks sexy.</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>If you tan at a salon this is a great daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t strip your tan.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap perfume, the likes of charlotte russe.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>and everyone, especially my bf who spends the most time closest to my skin, just raves about how i smell so good.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>but I will certainly buy one again when this one is used :)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll use this on dates and special occasions (or just whenever)</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it has a pump allowing for much easier application.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for use in conjunction with indoor tanning, but not as a sunless alternative as it adds no additional color but rather prevents existing color from fading as quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast too!  A+++</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than my tanning salons prices and got to me quickly!</li>
            <li>My Alba frangrance free lotion does a much better job at keeping my skin hydrated than this - I can take a shower put on my alba and not have to touch any lotion until my next shower.</li>
            <li>but this one is just so fresh that it doesn´t bother me.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve bought it right from their shelf, but decided to see if i could get it cheaper on Amazon (which i did,</li>
            <li>I PICKED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS RIGHT</li>
            <li>Obviously this works for many people</li>
            <li>I first heard about this moisturizer when I was at the tanning salon -</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I first tried this after-tan lotion at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and makes my tan last sooo much longer.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I was expecting something to keep my tan more vibrant and my skin moisened at the same time.</li>
            <li>It also is so packed full of fragrances and harsh chemicals that on top of tanning in a bed I had to discontue use because I come on, I didn&#x27;t want to murder my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very perfumed lotion.</li>
            <li>this smell is light enough that it does not give me headache</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy being glued to a bottle of lotion, I would highly recommend using a different product.</li>
            <li>When I arrived back home that day, after my tan, I immediately used it and instantly FELL IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>, I am just a little more health conscious and picky ;)</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend ordering from TanForLess</li>
            <li>Ive tried Tinted love (a little to tinted for me )</li>
            <li>I was previously using Designer Skin&#x27;s Black Tan Extender, and it was great</li>
            <li>most tan extenders are half the size at twice the price!</li>
            <li>Once you put it on your skin it becomes super soft and has a slight shimmer to it, plus it isn&#x27;t greasy at all and a little does go a long way; it seems great from the start.</li>
            <li>I chose to order this tan extending lotion because it&#x27;s relatively new in my salon</li>
            <li>It was one of the main reasons i purchased because i DO NOT like the smell of my skin directly after tanning and</li>
            <li>I first bought a sample of this lotion at my local tanning salon</li>
            <li>Made my skin soOOoo silky and soft for hours.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t thick it rubs on so smooth and soaks into skin very well</li>
            <li>bottle really lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It arrived a few days later, and like many other reviews the main appeal to this lotion is that it is NOT lingering on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy feeling like several tan extenders I have tried.</li>
            <li>Typically I put lotion on after a shower and in the morning when I first wake up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to my tan like other bronzing lotions do, but it does help extend the life of the tan -</li>
            <li>A little of this lotion goes a long way and is worth every penny.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The lotion moisturizes extremely well, and leaves skin feeling soft and refreshed minutes after application.</li>
            <li> This lotion seems like a nice, thick after-tan lotion, unfortunately i could not stand the smell of it enough to put anywhere but the back of my had to test it.</li>
            <li> This lotion mahes me so soft and not at all heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> long after the summer is over.</li>
            <li> and my face had dry patches on it.</li>
            <li> I tan regularly and typically use Bath and Body Works or Hempz.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you a long time even if you are an everyday tanner.</li>
            <li> Will purchase another as I am half way through current bottle!!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t buy any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle instant bronzing effect and has helped my tan stick around for a long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would have to be the smell.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another bottle of So Naughty Nude.</li>
            <li> I used to use Body Drench but switched to So Naughty Nude.</li>
            <li> So Naughty Nude reassures you that your tan will not fade away.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m still recovering from using this lotion and have gone back to using Neutrogena daily moisturizer and Bath and Body Works body lotion.</li>
            <li> I just didnt care for the smell and was a little oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend unless you just want a heavily scented lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells great,a fruit and very slight musk scent.</li>
            <li> i use in a small sample...</li>
            <li> incase i was not satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Found on amazon for half the price!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking are a dull unscented lotion, Wal-mart has Suave and Jergens.  </li>
            <li> but so thick it just dont work well for me and Rain</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t watery or thick.  </li>
            <li> Not too thin and not too thick.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent, not strong or overbearing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Im kind of picky about my lotions and I am totally in love with this one! Ive tried Tinted love (a little to tinted for me ) Forever after its really nice and smells so good but so thick it just dont work well for me and Rain I just didnt care for the smell and was a little oily. This lotion mahes me so soft and not at all heavy or greasy. Its the best after tan lotion I have ever used. I will stick with this one</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer! This is much cheaper than my tanning salons prices and got to me quickly! If you tan at a salon this is a great daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t strip your tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion seems like a nice, thick after-tan lotion, unfortunately i could not stand the smell of it enough to put anywhere but the back of my had to test it. It smells like a cheap perfume, the likes of charlotte russe. gave me a migraine.</li>
            <li> This product really helps keep your tan looking great, I use it even for when I am tanning outside, smells great too.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s great and I love the smell! I loved getting it so quickly!</li>
            <li> Smell is kind of musty.</li>
            <li> I love this tan extender!! It smells so good! And you can actually tell that it is helping extend the life of your tan!! It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at our local salon,love,love this lotin.It smells great,a fruit and very slight musk scent.Does an absolute great job extending my tan.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It keeps my tan longer and it smells amazing as well. Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;ps-It has a scent that lasts which is awesome as well</li>
            <li> Good stuff smells great and makes your skin very soft</li>
            <li> This lotion is so amazing. I was previously using Designer Skin&#x27;s Black Tan Extender, and it was great but the bottle was much smaller and more expensive. This stuff is just fantastic. I will def buy again. The smell is light and my skin feels great all day!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I was expecting something to keep my tan more vibrant and my skin moisened at the same time. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle but I just don&#x27;t think this product made a big enough difference to purchase again. It also is so packed full of fragrances and harsh chemicals that on top of tanning in a bed I had to discontue use because I come on, I didn&#x27;t want to murder my skin. My Alba frangrance free lotion does a much better job at keeping my skin hydrated than this - I can take a shower put on my alba and not have to touch any lotion until my next shower. Obviously this works for many people, I am just a little more health conscious and picky ;)</li>
            <li> I first heard about this moisturizer when I was at the tanning salon - They gave me a sample packet. When I arrived back home that day, after my tan, I immediately used it and instantly FELL IN LOVE. So I went and bought it! It smells amazing that even my boyfriend made a comment about it. It smells like an actual high-end perfume and not a lotion. Wonderful. I plan on buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I have just reordered my second bottle of this tan extending moisturizer. I LOVE it! I can´t use many lotions with fragrance because I get a headache but this one is just so fresh that it doesn´t bother me. It really makes me feel beautiful and does extend my tan... although now I only use it to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle really lasts a long time but I will certainly buy one again when this one is used :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and makes my tan last sooo much longer. Perfect for the long winters when I&#x27;m dying for a hint of sunkissed skin!</li>
            <li> I thought this was more of a sunless tanner. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a very perfumed lotion. I won&#x27;t be using. I don&#x27;t recommend unless you just want a heavily scented lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells good and goes on smoothly. Not too thin and not too thick. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the size of the bottle - most tan extenders are half the size at twice the price! The scent is wonderful - a very light perfume fragrance that DOES NOT smell anything like tanning lotion, which makes me very happy. The lotion moisturizes extremely well, and leaves skin feeling soft and refreshed minutes after application. It is not heavy or greasy feeling like several tan extenders I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to my tan like other bronzing lotions do, but it does help extend the life of the tan - I use it once daily after showering. Would recommend for use in conjunction with indoor tanning, but not as a sunless alternative as it adds no additional color but rather prevents existing color from fading as quickly. Also love the fact that it has a pump allowing for much easier application. I have purchased this lotion twice, and would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I chose to order this tan extending lotion because it&#x27;s relatively new in my salon and I have always wanted to try it. It was priced really well on Amazon and smells great. It has a subtle instant bronzing effect and has helped my tan stick around for a long time. Devoted makes the best tanning products I have ever used. I will be purchasing another bottle of So Naughty Nude.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It smells fabulous, it works great and I received it very quickly. I would buy this product again. Love it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Perfect price.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love them.</li>
            <li> I used to use Body Drench but switched to So Naughty Nude. This is by far my favorite! Love it</li>
            <li> I first bought a sample of this lotion at my local tanning salon and I fell in love.  The lotion isn&#x27;t watery or thick.  It has the perfect density.  It doesnt go on greasy and for those who tan, it compliments your bronzed skin.  This lotion does have a long lingering sweet smell, which is what I would expect by the packaging and the color of the bottle, which is common sense.  If you are looking are a dull unscented lotion, Wal-mart has Suave and Jergens.  I am on my third bottle of this stuff and I won&#x27;t buy any other lotion.  I am trying the Sugar Cookie version though!  A little of this lotion goes a long way and is worth every penny.  Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use if you are trying to keep your tan and stay moisturized. I did notice a difference in my skin tone after using it while I was tanning so that was a definite plus. My only complaint would have to be the smell. It did not smell like the smell it was described but besides that fact, the product was good.</li>
            <li> I first tried this after-tan lotion at the tanning salon i use in a small sample... and i was hooked. I would&#x27;ve bought it right from their shelf, but decided to see if i could get it cheaper on Amazon (which i did, 28 dollars compared to the 12+shipping i paid! Great deal!) It arrived a few days later, and like many other reviews the main appeal to this lotion is that it is NOT lingering on my skin. its non greasy but its enough to where i don&#x27;t feel to need to constantly be reapplying. The smell I, personally, LOVE. It was one of the main reasons i purchased because i DO NOT like the smell of my skin directly after tanning and this smell is light enough that it does not give me headache and everyone, especially my bf who spends the most time closest to my skin, just raves about how i smell so good. Great purchase for the price and i highly recommend ordering from TanForLess, it was an excellent deal and came promptly, packaged well with information incase i was not satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I PICKED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND THE DESCRIPTION SAID EVERYTHING THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  THE SMELL OF IT IS GREAT, THE TEXTURE OF IT IS JUST RIGHT AND I WOULD REPURCHASE THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! When i opened my package i didnt didnt expect the bottle to be as big as it is. Its a huge bottle. The scent is nice. Its not overpowering and it makea me skin so silky. Id def. Buy this again! Shipping was very fast too!  A+++</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion from the tanning salon inside of my gym. I tan regularly and typically use Bath and Body Works or Hempz. First off, it smells AMAZING and the bottle looks sexy. So... it comes off as a sexy lotion, and because of the price it should be descent. Once you put it on your skin it becomes super soft and has a slight shimmer to it, plus it isn&#x27;t greasy at all and a little does go a long way; it seems great from the start. Because it&#x27;s an after tan lotion I put it on my face. Typically I put lotion on after a shower and in the morning when I first wake up. Three days after using this lotion I noticed legs were turning white with dryness and my face had dry patches on it. Needless to say I&#x27;m still recovering from using this lotion and have gone back to using Neutrogena daily moisturizer and Bath and Body Works body lotion. Unless you enjoy being glued to a bottle of lotion, I would highly recommend using a different product.</li>
            <li> So Naughty Nude reassures you that your tan will not fade away. This bottle will last you a long time even if you are an everyday tanner. The smell is sexy, and the lotion has added diamond shimmers to make your skin glow. Take care of your bronzed skin!</li>
            <li> Made my skin soOOoo silky and soft for hours. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it.  I think I&#x27;ll use this on dates and special occasions (or just whenever) long after the summer is over. I think it&#x27;s the silicone - smooths my skin - like nothing I&#x27;ve never used before. Very faint scent, not strong or overbearing. The bottle is just too cute on my bathroom counter. Not to mention this is a 1/5 of the price they were asking at my tanning salon. It&#x27;s a big bottle!</li>
            <li> I used this last tanning season at salon I go to, salon price more than I wanted to pay.. Found on amazon for half the price!! Great product really does what it says it does!!! Will purchase another as I am half way through current bottle!! Love! Love! Love! This product!!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick it rubs on so smooth and soaks into skin very well and I have noticed that it extends my tan</li>
