            <li>but it is really good</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people think for a makeup sponge, spending upwards of $20 doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea, but believe me when I say that YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVED it for: Powers.  </li>
            <li>Good blending and non-caking finish.  </li>

            <li>The beautyblender has the most flawless foundation application I&#x27;ve EVER seen--and I&#x27;ve used brushes from a plethora of top tier brands.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews say it gives a great, airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>But you have to use it the right way to get the best results</li>

            <li>no streaks, no weird blending issues, just perfect airbrushed skin.</li>
            <li>I compared this to my kabuki brush and my brush had no chance of winning!</li>
            <li>I love mine!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and my skin looks so naturally healthy!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Save your money, you can blend better with your fingers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have been hearing absolutely amazing things about the beautify blender.</li>
            <li>beauty blender is amazing</li>
            <li>The beauty blender is amazing.</li>
            <li>This did a great job of providing smooth coverage and did not lift the makeup off as you blended.</li>
            <li>I used it and it is seriously AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>that I noticed how AMAZING it looked even from a shorter distance.</li>
            <li>This sponge is amazing.    </li>
            <li>This thing gives an amazing finish when used with my foundation</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>It does leave my makeup with a great texture, so that&#x27;s a huge pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used correctly, the BeautyBlender is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but this product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best applicator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but honestly I prefer using my fingers..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to be honest...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a timely shipping and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and it really does make any liquid foundation look so flawless and airbrushed.</li>
            <li>and I was really impressed, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got really close up</li>
            <li>i just use a bar soap (like ivory) and it cleanses the sponge nicely.  </li>
            <li>and they both ordered their own immediately after.  </li>
            <li>And, for someone who doesn&#x27;t care much for make-up, I was truly impressed.</li>
            <li>i love it really good, product i woo</li>
            <li>Makes application of makeup (concealer, for me) easy, quick, and FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!</li>
            <li>I read a review that this particular foundation worked best with a beautyblender.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend getting a Beauty Blender if you&#x27;re looking for a way to apply make-up flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It works great and has very easy clean up.</li>
            <li>I use this to put on a cream powder foundation, and also concealer, and it leaves a smooth, amazing finish!</li>
            <li>It still blends perfectly and feels brand new.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to handle, and works GREAT!</li>
            <li>, the beauty blender is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>, the beauty blender is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Blends my foundation beautifully, but it started cracking after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it does make foundation look very smooth on.</li>
            <li>They make my foundation look flawless and allow for great coverage with little effort and amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>It really does apply the makeup smoothly and evenly for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this is and the finish it creates is beautiful!</li>
            <li>I really like the BeautyBlender make up sponge; the resulting makeup finish is very nice, but not quite as spectacular as reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a very light and airbrushed effect, which is lovely.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tools.</li>
            <li>Now I use Revlon and this; it&#x27;s even better coverage than Mac now.</li>
            <li>but it was much better.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using more of a blotting, sweeping motion instead of rubbing it</li>
            <li>I freaking love my beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I love the Beauty Blender for liquid and cream foundation application.</li>
            <li>Love using this beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ETA: As the wife and user of this product I have to say that I do love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s easier and looks better on my face with a brush</li>
            <li>I really love this blender..</li>
            <li>still love this sponge</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Just love the way this applies foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is not as pointed on the top for contouring.</li>
            <li>Most of the stains come out this way, though you won&#x27;t be able to avoid deeper stains over time.</li>
            <li>It is good, although I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>Such wonderful reviews...thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>Love the beautyblender.  </li>
            <li>I had read a lot about this tool and was hesitant to buy it, I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better than brushes or using my fingertips.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It got out most of the color from my foundation besides two spots.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again once this one goes out of commission. :-)</li>
            <li>I used my free 2-day shipping from amazon prime and it arrived the day after I ordered it!</li>
            <li>The packaging is so adorable.</li>
            <li>I love how the beautyblender does just what it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love this cleaner.  </li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it cant get</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>WISH I COULD GIVE THIS MORE STARS.</li>
            <li>but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t looked caked on by any means, and it has a much more skin like texture.</li>
            <li>but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t looked caked on by any means, and it has a much more skin like texture.</li>
            <li>Love Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried it with powder foundations, liquid and cream (my preferred one) and it does a fantastic job on all of them!</li>
            <li>I thought I would offer some helpful tips for anyone who needs it. :)</li>
            <li>Makes my life a lot easier :)</li>
            <li>Okay so I ordered this item thinking it was the kit as the posting states:</li>
            <li>I am sure the sponge performs</li>
            <li>I use it every day - it&#x27;s more porous than alternative sponges and allows for more even coverage.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and I love how it applies my foundation</li>
            <li>I love using this for blending my concealer.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>beauty blenders have changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but in the end I like brushes better for those.</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on more evenly and stays on throughout the day better.</li>
            <li>It does help, like any sponge would, but I find my airbrush concealer brush to work much better for contouring my face and blending in</li>
            <li>is 2.5 to 4.5 minutes too many.  </li>
            <li>I find I use 30-50% more foundation than when using my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It does soak up more than a bit of product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this sponge applies my liquid</li>
            <li>Sigma brush is much better imo.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it as directed...</li>
            <li>I love the way it works though.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see how it would make my makeup application any better, or easier.</li>
            <li>I really love these sponges and I can&#x27;t do my makeup without them anymore.</li>
            <li>My make up looks so much better because of this.</li>
            <li>Using the beautyblender, my makeup goes farther and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I read the instructions though</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Although white is not the best color choice..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with all beauty blenders</li>
            <li>Whether it is or not, it works great for me, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Most people would think like i did that its just a makeup sponge...</li>
            <li>Love Beautyblender sponges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>The one that I received was not an authentic beautyblender sponge.</li>
            <li>I love this beauty blender</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li>This is something much more than that.</li>
            <li>I want 10 more</li>
            <li>it was stunning at blending in my concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVVVVEEEE the beauty blender!!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these!!!</li>
            <li>The PURE blender is amazing!</li>

            <li>I feel so gorgeous in my foundation for the first time EVER.</li>
            <li>so I will be excited to see how that works!</li>
            <li>Cannot replace the original with knockoffs!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you run it under cool water after use!  </li>
            <li>For days when I want more coverage it is easy to build your foundation as desired without it looking caked on.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to squish</li>
            <li>It makes blending much more easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and gives a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It also washes clean very easily by hand.</li>
            <li>This is the best make up tool ever, I use this for almost all of my loose powders and liquids</li>
            <li>But i like that there is no dye and that its so neutral and pure looking (again when clean... lol)</li>
            <li>More time between cleanings &#x3D; more work to clean.</li>
            <li>It does, however, offer a smooth, even application that is somewhat akin to, but  ever so slightly better that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail for it.</li>
            <li>Loveeeee, loooooove, loooooove nice, light weight, and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This SPONGE did not work any better than the cheap wedges one can buy.  </li>
            <li>I have used this sponge lightly damp as suggested by many people.</li>
            <li>and how easily it gets</li>
            <li>Easy to use easy to wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>in fact, I would say its cleared up a bit because the sponge is so easy to clean out every couple of days. :)</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to blend my makeup.  </li>
            <li>The shape gets into every nook and cranny of your face easily.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>It works wonders and is important to clean to prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, I noticed it does give a nice airbrush like finish.</li>
            <li>had just purchased the new ABH cream contour kit in medium and was waiting for a good applicator sponge to begin using it.</li>
            <li>The Black one is used with complexion products, long-wear makeup, and self-tanners for flawless results.</li>
            <li>It still works fine, but the blender wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I thought.</li>
            <li>and Revlon &amp;#34;24 hour color-stay&amp;#34; and it blended them fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase the cleaner, but I did use dawn dish detergent and that works fine.</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing cracks in the sponge at the spot I use it most, it still applies my foundations amazingly but after about 6 months I suggest buying a new one...</li>
            <li>I use less product and get nice even coverage that looks great.</li>
            <li>Super easy to keep clean and blends everything to perfection!</li>
            <li>While it less than impressed me with liquids, I was surprised to find that I truly loved it for applying powers and blushes.  </li>
            <li>I immediately clean my beautyblender after I&#x27;ve finished using it every time and have never had any problems with my makeup becoming discolored or not applying evenly, and the product hasn&#x27;t caused skin irritation as a result.  </li>
            <li>The shape is especially nice because you can fit in tight spaces on the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to try it!</li>
            <li>Can easily adjust make-up, washes out clean.  </li>
            <li>This helped filled them in and minimized the appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just go with a cheap sponge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean easily (even with BeautyBlender product).</li>
            <li>The skin looks so smooth and not cakey at all.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between the cheap sponges you can buy at target or any drug store.</li>
            <li>Mine is stain free also still</li>
            <li>So smooth and no spotty makeup patches</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really DOES do an amazing job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, just soap and water</li>
            <li>It gives me an incredibly smooth and natural-looking application.  </li>
            <li>It feels like cheap foam.</li>
            <li>Applies make up evenly and in easy to clean.</li>
            <li>If I had wanted a dupe, I would have bought a cheap dupe.</li>
            <li>excellent if I got a wee bit heavy</li>
            <li>I have never gotten my foundation to look this natural or this flattering, just when I was about to give up foundation for good.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten my foundation to look this natural or this flattering, just when I was about to give up foundation for good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>I wanted, nay good sir, NEEDED a BeautyBlender, to see the magical majesty it would take my daily makeup routine to.</li>
            <li>Received  it right on time:-)</li>
            <li>It does a great job, same quality as the original.</li>
            <li>Never looks like a mask, but you easily get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(only when it&#x27;s clean lol).</li>
            <li>Keeping it clean and bacteria free is important, so you will clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li>I DO find this highly superior to using a brush or &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; make up sponge, but not significantly better than a good fingertip</li>
            <li>I HAD to try it, and was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to be gentle with it!</li>
            <li>As soon as I got the beauty blender I watch U boxing videos on YouTube to make sure I was getting the real deal, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Was excited when I received the Beauty Blender sponge.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I believe the dye in the original one broke out my skin.</li>
            <li>These will do a better job of getting the stains out verses using your cleanser and are much cheaper than splurging on the beauty blender one!</li>
            <li>The payoff is worth it!</li>
            <li>The payoff is worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I think these blenders are well worth the price!</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the Pure version since I loved the sponge so much.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started being diligent about keeping it clean, it stopped deteriorating.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny, flawlessly applies foundation and cream blush without leaving harsh demarcation lines.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best makeup related purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t clean it immediately after applying your makeup.</li>
            <li>Clean it with a liquid soap or dish soap.</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on thick and smooth - basically flawless.  </li>
            <li>Honestly my hand can produce similar but better application.</li>
            <li>Taken care of appropriately, the Beauty Blender will last you a long time and keep you looking flawless.</li>
            <li>to clean, I love the white since I heard the pink color bleeds when cleaning the original, and blends everything perfectly!</li>
            <li>I loved what it did for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy the white one if you have a neurotic tick about things being clean and/or not stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a non-brand beauty sponge before but didn&#x27;t get nearly the amazing coverage this one does.</li>
            <li>really love it ^^ ..was really scared of it getting stained ...</li>
            <li>Everything u have heard about the bob is true.</li>
            <li>and I honestly have no use for any of my old foundation and concealer brushes anymore.</li>
            <li>Reviews on this are true.</li>
            <li>I had heard only good things about the beautyblender sponge in my online makeup group.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one, and I will try to be more gentle with it.</li>
            <li>( light coverage, Prescriptives Virtual Skin) and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who wants to make the most of their makeup and get a poreless look.</li>
            <li>Using this sponge (at the pointy end, for crevices) does have benefit of being more gentle on the eye area (where one should avoid tugging, etc).  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this, but I have to say IT REALLY IS FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>so I always wear full coveraged foundations.</li>
            <li>I really want to like this product because it&#x27;s used by so many people</li>
            <li>Good product for makeup, soft &amp; easy used, I like it too Mach, I well buy more a next month.</li>
            <li>This has helped significantly in getting a smooth, consistent finish with my mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li>The white color is not worth paying more, but this product is wonderful for putting on foundation.</li>
            <li>This worked better with more sheer, thinner consistency foundation.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping no issues.</li>
            <li>to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>because I read it was best for sensitive skin and did not have the color transfer issues I&#x27;d read  about with the pink one.</li>
            <li>If only there was a flat side with this softness, then it would be perfect!  </li>
            <li>I notice many professional make up artists use them which is a good visual recommendation.</li>
            <li>I find that it gives me a much more natural finish than using a brush, and is also easier to clean than bristles.</li>
            <li>This little makeup sponge applies your foundation so smoothly, it is just amazing!</li>
            <li>Ordered a new one IMMEDIATELY... with an AirPort case. :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy and convenient to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY!</li>
            <li>I even had some left over on my hand because I assumed it would take more!</li>
            <li>I even had some left over on my hand because I assumed it would take more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super bummed, the transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to try it!is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to get another at a great discount as it applies foundation flawlessly especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I first owned and used the original pink beauty blender and loved it, but my skin didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d heard great things about this little number.</li>
            <li>Love the Pure better than the Pro that I recently purchased.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone comparing this to a store bought sponge, the actual authentic beauty blender is a huge step up</li>
            <li>I feel that I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, and will reorder when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>I had watched several Youtube videos explaining how to use the BeautyBlender effectively.</li>
            <li>and you want a more natural looking foundation</li>
            <li>and you want a more natural looking foundation</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a more natural soap (dr bronners liquid Castile soap) but have heard of success using Dawn dish soap too.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!1</li>
            <li>I believe the beauty blender is worth 15.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to spend more $ in the meantime and order a blender directly from beauty blender and compare</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its kind of gross.</li>
            <li>It is costly as sponges go, but worth the price.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is heaven and totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure if my skin is sensitive to it although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that ...</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot recommend it enough, I&#x27;ve never been more impressed by a product.</li>
            <li>The knockoff I received was more elongated and had a more sharply pointed tip.</li>
            <li>It performs far better than my high quality foundation brush or my fairly cheap Ulta sponges.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m sure after the next time I clean it, it will come out.</li>
            <li>I would just make sure you clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>I have used all the imitation beauty blenders and even though they were great, they don&#x27;t compare to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Those who are unimpressed, I&#x27;m guessing, are not using it the right way.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing special.</li>
            <li>Its super super super soft.</li>
            <li>: 01/01/15: after buying a true beauty blender I can say this one is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks more natural, def going to keep purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this as her birthday present and said that it works seamlessly to blend her makeup!  </li>
            <li>I honestly can not believe I waited so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li>tears easily - seems of lesser quality than originally manufactured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this sponge and any other one when you dab or pat instead of using more of a wiping motion.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wet it though!!! :)</li>
            <li>I looooove the pure BB!</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean especially if you rinse it well after you use it each time.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice air brushed look and apply my foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li>The material that it&#x27;s made out of is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily.</li>
            <li>Does not do a great job of blending and is kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li>Using brushes can be more harsh on the skin, more pulling and tugging, hold bacteria, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used regular makeup sponges, but this really blends nicely.  </li>
            <li>I do keep mine clean with beautyblender cleanser, which works just fine to get it back to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was VERY gentle, followed cleaning instructions to a T, etc.</li>
            <li>The material is super soft and looks like it could easily rip if too much pressure is used in those spots, so I pulled the blender out carefully and instead of pushing it back into the plastic to store it, I just sat it on top to see if the indents will come out on their own.</li>
            <li>I watched many tutorial videos prior to using to ensure I was applying</li>
            <li>Theoretically speaking I could see how it would help, as instead of &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; the foundation in you&#x27;re more &amp;#34;blotting&amp;#34; the foundation on, which would fill the pore instead of just cover it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also tore one of the first times I washed it.</li>
            <li>If/when it wears out, I will definitely order another as I like the way my foundation looks; better than a brush.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This thing is EXACTLY like those.</li>
            <li>There anre many copies of this item but none are the same.  </li>
            <li>Great product.. Not much more to say haha</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be at your sink for an hour trying to get all of the soap out if you use too much!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they put a cheap sponge inside.</li>
            <li>but more than likely I will not be repurchasing it because I still find myself reaching for my brush when using this.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first application with this beauty blender</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic tool for people who have sensitive skin, acne prone, etc.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it!</li>
            <li>They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it!</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over a year and probably would have lasted longer had it not dropped in the bathroom</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with applying makeup.</li>
            <li>At first I also used it for my blush and powder</li>
            <li>ripped the first week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with the flawless look</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know how to use at first but went on Utube and saw tutorials on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, within the first week it started to fall apart (rips, chunks falling out, etc)...</li>
            <li>but OMG it was way more, i don&#x27;t know what they do to make it different</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I&#x27;m googly-eyed in LOVE.</li>
            <li>I will play with it more, I only had it for a month.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally got my hands on one of these beauties!</li>
            <li>I loved my beauty blender for the few weeks I had it.</li>
            <li>I found a good hydrating foundation and with this sponge I have no problems at all with uneven coverage or flakes.</li>
            <li>kabuki brush is still a good product if you need heavy coverage to hide a lot of pimples or redness, but if you don&#x27;t need a lot of make up</li>
            <li>The kabuki brush is still a good product if you need heavy coverage to hide a lot of pimples or redness, but if you don&#x27;t need a lot of make up</li>
            <li>I clean mine periodically with my all natural Castile soap (dr bronners) and all the stains disappear!</li>
            <li>I cut that sponge straight up thru the middle and now it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>They smell better, are easier to clean (i.e. more product comes out leaving them less stained), and last longer.</li>
            <li>On the positive side....</li>
            <li>However, if you are on a budget I wouldn&#x27;t get this product, just because I don&#x27;t think it works any better than your traditional beauty wedge that you can find really cheap at your local store.</li>
            <li>However, I do love the flat side of the Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my favorite foundation, and as long as I&#x27;m using it, I will continue to use this beautyblender.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Beauty Blender because I was a few bucks short of my free super-saving shipping on an order and had heard good things about it.</li>
            <li>The white one is a bit of a pain to keep looking clean, but as long as you do clean it after each use it is fine.</li>
            <li>I find the Pure Beautybenders to be far better than the original pink ones.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions and wet it first.</li>
            <li>I was kind of put off by the price at first, but decided it was an investment and curiosity killed the cat</li>
            <li>I have some areas of large pores around my nasal folds.</li>
            <li>the pure version</li>
            <li>the pure can be used for skin treatment products or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cannot live without the Beauty Blender!!</li>
            <li>This product certainly doesn&#x27;t justify the high cost!</li>
            <li>try to let the sponge souk the liquid soup , then squeeze it  and rub it gently in your hand  as much as you need and rinse</li>
            <li>I really like this beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I also use it to blend my concealer and it works very well for that</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s better to use it wet anyway</li>
            <li>Makes a much easier job of putting on tinted moisturizer or foundation.  </li>
            <li>it blends your makeup in really well..</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>(1) I used to use my fingertips, and I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much makeup as I do now.</li>
            <li>one from a seller with 100% feedback - Lock &amp; Mane sells real beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>and I was SO blown away that I went straight here to write this review.</li>
            <li>and I got really</li>
            <li>The difference is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up).</li>
            <li>Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it.</li>
            <li>if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up).</li>
            <li>Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it.</li>
            <li>No different from the cheap wedge though.</li>
            <li>Too much money for a &#x27;sponge&#x27;</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the amount of work</li>
            <li>One thing that I noticed people were forgetting to do is make sure that the sponge is wet before you use it.</li>
            <li>Its the real beauty blender</li>
            <li>really any makeup product.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This does not as it is very porous and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blend very well</li>
            <li>I much prefer applying foundation, blush, concealer, etc.</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that gives me such a smooth and even foundation application.</li>
            <li>Then I came across a foundation that I really wanted to like, but it wasn&#x27;t applying very well on my face.  </li>
            <li>Works so well highly recommend !</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I think the sponge is absorbing my concealer and foundation as I&#x27;m trying to blend out the concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think I will just stick to my concealer brush that works really well.</li>
            <li>I have both and bought this white one thinking it would be nice to have an all white blender.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t expand as much when wet as the authentic sponge.</li>
            <li>ALSO - be sure to air dry them before storing them!!</li>
            <li>WOW, again a must have!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same).</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re careful and make sure to avoid any fingernail contact when you&#x27;re washing it, it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I recommend this because the blender will last MUCH longer if you keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>Better than other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>And keep in mind, some foundations just may work better with one over the other.  </li>
            <li>(I clean mine every 2 days of use and just use regular cleanser and water.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased from this seller absorbs way too much product, and is 2-3 times larger than a true beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>I do clean it with my brush cleaner and/or baby soap regularly.</li>
            <li>This works really well and is high quality.</li>
            <li>Good makeup tool, does get dirty easily though.</li>
            <li>Very soft, much softer than my Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li>i used it  4 times  with 2 different foundations ( revlon colorstay and l&#x27;oreal true match ).</li>
            <li>If you want full coverage with this, you are going to have to go back over areas.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just a personal preference and bone structure, not a knock against the blender :) I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought one of these at a local boutique and paid ten dollars more then on amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not going to last and for this amount of money one would expect it to last  through more than maybe 15 uses, washing it gently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have a lot of acne scars left from a mildly severe cystic acne breakout)</li>
            <li>I would rather pay the extra money if I know for a fact that the one I&#x27;m getting is real and worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Makes my make up very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is evenly blended and my skin looks very velvety and silky</li>
            <li>I use it at least 3-4 times a week and love it!</li>
            <li>I truly had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love this little sponge, but it&#x27;s pricy.</li>
            <li>I love this, it really can make your store brand makeup look a lot nicer if you aply it correctly with this little guy!</li>
            <li>Sadly, the cat got on the counter and decided it made a great cat toy so this one is a replacement.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this product really delivers in creating a natural finish.</li>
            <li>In my experience there is absolutely no comparison between this sponge and a cheap sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In order to try and avoid having it fall apart completely, I can&#x27;t wash it very thoroughly</li>
            <li>A bit messy, with the fingers when makeup soaks through the sponge, but I use this daily; washes it every three days or so by using a gentle soap and running warm water over the sponge.  </li>
            <li>With proper treatment this will last a long time and it more than worth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, this is a nice blender, but it didn&#x27;t change my life, at least not for that price point.</li>
            <li>I was definitely weary about a $15 &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; but trust me its worth every penny</li>
            <li>I clean it with a mild soap every few days and it is holding up well so far.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It is not the normal egg shape.</li>
            <li>I get pretty much the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine came out a little dented and after the first wash (I squeezed it as gently as I could when wringing it out), the teardrop shape quickly became warped.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I use a foundation for dry skin so the formula is more oily, I dont know how well it will wash out of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was slightly cheaper than the original pink blender and was touted to be better for sensitive skin, with the added benefit of zero dye bleeding.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one with the mini +</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to the type</li>
            <li>and it looks new again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the trick to getting it clean is to put the cleaning liquid in the palm of your hand ,wet the sponge and then just like you are applying  the foundation  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: wet the sponge, squeeze out excess water and squeeze in a clean towel before using each time.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my makeup looks and will continue to use this little sponge!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you do use dawn detergent, be sure to only use a TINY TINY bit, because it IS a concentrated soap.</li>
            <li>Two days later I received my package (thanks Prime!)</li>
            <li>Sure its not magical...</li>
            <li>I bought this in comparison to the cheaper version (4 pack monster blender one) and it does the exact same thing as this \\&quot;just 1\\&quot; sponge.</li>
            <li>The white one is so pretty</li>
            <li>my application: FLAWLESSS and NATURAL!</li>
            <li>mismatched combinations of all of the above in blistering hot water, repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Expect to use a little more makeup than you usually do because the sponge does soak it up pretty well, but its worth it, because the end result gives you a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I did not want to buy the BeautyBlender Cleanser (liquid or solid) when I have used any of the above mentioned to clean a variety of brushes to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I clean mine every other use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard and absorbs way more product than a normal beauty blender should.</li>
            <li>I heard the white one is better because of there being less chemicals.</li>
            <li>However I have only had it for a short amount of time and it seems to be deteriorating before my eyes, doesn&#x27;t look very pretty.</li>
            <li>I finally took the plunge and purchases this BeautyBlender Pure.</li>
            <li>but this one is too little to fit into drying holder.....:</li>
            <li>Before purchasing the BeautyBlender I was using cheap wedge sponges that tended to leave little sponge pieces all over my face.</li>
            <li>It just seemed pricey to me for a sponge, but I am glad I finally invested in this little guy.</li>
            <li>But this one is really hard and it absorb way more product</li>
            <li>You use entirely too much product to ever warrant using this thing.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried using an knock-off brands, as I read unfavorable reviews on some, but I do not regret spending the extra money on &amp;#34;the real thing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>how can a simple sponge get so much hype.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be dealing with dyes--so far, my sensitive skin has not had any reactions...</li>
            <li>It is so soft and make up becomes so blendable when using this product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all soft and stuff.</li>
            <li>(Easily fixed.)  </li>
            <li>The beauty blender is soft and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>plan on asking a few makeup artist friends of mine if this is just how the dye free one is, or if I received a knockoff, and updating my review.</li>
            <li>Makes makeup application seamless.</li>
            <li>Unless you have an old one that is being trashed anyways, then go ahead.</li>
            <li>Unless you have an old one that is being trashed anyways, then go ahead.</li>
            <li>The green minis are used for the inner eye corners, brow bones, sides of nose, cheeks, and more.</li>
            <li>I have used it for approximately 4 months and it is still holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>Its so soft to the touch, puts on foundation like no other!</li>
            <li>I use a little bit of water and the beautycleanser and just make sure all the suds are out before letting it air dry.</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot recommend it enough, I&#x27;ve never been more impressed by a product.y around the dry spots of my face, (I mean dry flaky skin, not just dry areas)</li>
            <li>have every type of sponge and foundation brush they make: high end to low end.</li>
            <li>I bought the white sponge to apply highly pigmented goo to my face.</li>
            <li>It works like no other sponge I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>One thing I would say is that though the pink one is cute get the white one because the pink can leak color.</li>
            <li>(If you order from amazon directly, not just fulfilled by amazon, you will also find a real one)</li>
            <li>I usually get it from sephora, but I thought I would order this dye free one.</li>
            <li>The beauty blender is my favorite tool to apply foundation and the white one doesn&#x27;t bleed the pink color like the pink one does!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first, I ordered this one due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I usually use a flat top kabuki (buffer) brush to apply my foundation</li>
            <li>This little thing makes applying foundation effortless and quick.</li>
            <li>This kit includes: 1 beautyblender® pure sponge, 1 solid cleanser, 1.0 oz., and 1 white organza bag.</li>
            <li>My foundation dries very quickly and is hard to work with.  </li>
            <li>The Pure is reference to the purity of a white product and the absence of dyes I guess.</li>
            <li>Flat kabuki brush was the first thing I tried, and it buffed my make up out easily and left a heavy coverage that looked better than it would have if I&#x27;d have attempted it with a generic make up sponge and with less product waste.</li>
            <li>It was received in what appeared to be real packaging, but the sponge did appear a slightly different shade of white from the original beauty blenders I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>I found out the pure beautyblender is made for sensitive skin if you cant use dyes and also it is made for applying complexion products, serums, eye treatments, moisturizers, makeup removers, and any other skincare product. .</li>
            <li>When slightly damp, they work better and absorb less of your makeup.</li>
            <li>Clean it after it has dried, like the next morning or at bed time.</li>
            <li>this particular blender is only 3/4 the size of the same one</li>
            <li>As a person myself who only wears concealer this made my makeup look seamless and creaseless.</li>
            <li>Works very well… gives that airbrushed look with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>any barely deposits any on my face.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps after the glowing reviews I was expecting miracles and I&#x27;m still just the same old me.  </li>
            <li>Inc.  I definitely learned my lesson to not buy a beautyblender unless I know it came directly from the manufacturer to the retail location that I&#x27;m purchasing from.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not sure about splurging on the original, try out the white one.</li>
            <li>I mean the box if prerry easy to open</li>
            <li>After having bought the real beautyblender multiple times from a different retailer, I was able to spot that this was a fake before I even opened the package.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to clean and take out the stains.</li>
            <li>When wet, this sponge was smaller than the original and did not work to properly apply makeup products as expected.</li>
            <li>They look the same but the foam on copies is no different than old timey foam squares.</li>
            <li>I tore the package open like a wild animal and opened up my BeautyBlender instantly.</li>
            <li>Item received was a fake, NOT the Original Beauty Blender Pure as ordered.</li>
            <li>, I ordered two because they were less than purchasing them at Sephora (the only place that sells them, that I&#x27;m aware of).</li>
            <li>wet first, towel dry, then apply the foundation in a stippling (bouncing) manner.</li>
            <li>The finish it gives you and its blending ability is much the same as any other sponge, so I wont be investing in this product again.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>+ on a cosmetic sponge, but when I saw the Beauty Blender PURE on Amazon for about half the price, I purchased...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, I bought the white color after reading the pink may bleed.</li>
            <li>It has very small pores which sets it apart from many other sponges.</li>
            <li>The thicker foundation really caused caking, and random dark spots where there was more of a product build-up, as (mentioned above)</li>
            <li>This was such a great purchase, I&#x27;m only disappointed I didn&#x27;t start buying these puppies earlier.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that if you wet ALL beautyblenders, they swell but when it dries it goes back to its original size of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;The pink beauty blender is used for primers, foundations, powders, cream blushes, and any other complexion product.</li>
            <li>Even though I bought the white \\&quot;pure\\&quot; blender, the stains are completely removed after a single wash.</li>
            <li>This will also shred minutes off of your makeup routine no matter how little or how much makeup you put on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the original pink BeautyBlender, but the white option just appealed to me more (less scary pink dye maybe?).</li>

            <li> great-</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing all of the great reviews and because using my fingers just wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li> This blender is working great</li>
            <li> Great buy</li>
            <li> So i ordered this two days ago shipping was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> great quality.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> use it with liquid foundation and I am able to achieve a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and authentic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a remarkable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li> and I love that this cleans up great!</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders, they make your makeup look absolutely flawless!</li>
            <li> And maybe a nice Christmas sale!</li>
            <li> This sponge applies your liquid makeup flawlessly and easily.</li>
            <li> looks good</li>
            <li> It is good quality</li>
            <li> It is still the best blender out there, I have tried cheap copies.  </li>
            <li> good product just have to wash after every use</li>
            <li> which I would&#x27;ve used as my cat decided he loved it as well.</li>
            <li> but it is really good</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people think for a makeup sponge, spending upwards of $20 doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea, but believe me when I say that YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVED it for: Powers.  </li>
            <li> Good blending and non-caking finish.  </li>
            <li> Awesome and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation look sooo good and</li>
            <li> Its perfect and so easy to use, I love the weight and shape!</li>
            <li> The beautyblender has the most flawless foundation application I&#x27;ve EVER seen--and I&#x27;ve used brushes from a plethora of top tier brands.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews say it gives a great, airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it the right way to get the best results</li>
            <li> Applies foundation smoothly and beautifully.  </li>
            <li> After I finished application I fell in love!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Love my beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Edit: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BUY FROM A TRUSTED SELLER!</li>
            <li> And I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Any time you save by using this will be more than used up by the minutes (plural!)</li>
            <li> no streaks, no weird blending issues, just perfect airbrushed skin.</li>
            <li> I compared this to my kabuki brush and my brush had no chance of winning!</li>
            <li> I love mine!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and my skin looks so naturally healthy!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Save your money, you can blend better with your fingers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have been hearing absolutely amazing things about the beautify blender.</li>
            <li> beauty blender is amazing</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is amazing.</li>
            <li> This did a great job of providing smooth coverage and did not lift the makeup off as you blended.</li>
            <li> I used it and it is seriously AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> that I noticed how AMAZING it looked even from a shorter distance.</li>
            <li> This sponge is amazing.    </li>
            <li> This thing gives an amazing finish when used with my foundation</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> It does leave my makeup with a great texture, so that&#x27;s a huge pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used correctly, the BeautyBlender is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> but this product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best applicator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but honestly I prefer using my fingers..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be honest...</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a timely shipping and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and it really does make any liquid foundation look so flawless and airbrushed.</li>
            <li> and I was really impressed, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got really close up</li>
            <li> i just use a bar soap (like ivory) and it cleanses the sponge nicely.  </li>
            <li> and they both ordered their own immediately after.  </li>
            <li> And, for someone who doesn&#x27;t care much for make-up, I was truly impressed.</li>
            <li> i love it really good, product i woo</li>
            <li> Makes application of makeup (concealer, for me) easy, quick, and FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!</li>
            <li> I read a review that this particular foundation worked best with a beautyblender.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend getting a Beauty Blender if you&#x27;re looking for a way to apply make-up flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It works great and has very easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I use this to put on a cream powder foundation, and also concealer, and it leaves a smooth, amazing finish!</li>
            <li> It still blends perfectly and feels brand new.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to handle, and works GREAT!</li>
            <li> , the beauty blender is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> , the beauty blender is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Blends my foundation beautifully, but it started cracking after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it does make foundation look very smooth on.</li>
            <li> They make my foundation look flawless and allow for great coverage with little effort and amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> It really does apply the makeup smoothly and evenly for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this is and the finish it creates is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I really like the BeautyBlender make up sponge; the resulting makeup finish is very nice, but not quite as spectacular as reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a very light and airbrushed effect, which is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tools.</li>
            <li> Now I use Revlon and this; it&#x27;s even better coverage than Mac now.</li>
            <li> but it was much better.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using more of a blotting, sweeping motion instead of rubbing it</li>
            <li> I freaking love my beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I love the Beauty Blender for liquid and cream foundation application.</li>
            <li> Love using this beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ETA: As the wife and user of this product I have to say that I do love it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s easier and looks better on my face with a brush</li>
            <li> I really love this blender..</li>
            <li> still love this sponge</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Just love the way this applies foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is not as pointed on the top for contouring.</li>
            <li> Most of the stains come out this way, though you won&#x27;t be able to avoid deeper stains over time.</li>
            <li> It is good, although I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> Such wonderful reviews...thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> Love the beautyblender.  </li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this tool and was hesitant to buy it, I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I like this much better than brushes or using my fingertips.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It got out most of the color from my foundation besides two spots.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again once this one goes out of commission. :-)</li>
            <li> I used my free 2-day shipping from amazon prime and it arrived the day after I ordered it!</li>
            <li> The packaging is so adorable.</li>
            <li> I love how the beautyblender does just what it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this cleaner.  </li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love it cant get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> WISH I COULD GIVE THIS MORE STARS.</li>
            <li> but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t looked caked on by any means, and it has a much more skin like texture.</li>
            <li> but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t looked caked on by any means, and it has a much more skin like texture.</li>
            <li> Love Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried it with powder foundations, liquid and cream (my preferred one) and it does a fantastic job on all of them!</li>
            <li> I thought I would offer some helpful tips for anyone who needs it. :)</li>
            <li> Makes my life a lot easier :)</li>
            <li> Okay so I ordered this item thinking it was the kit as the posting states:</li>
            <li> I am sure the sponge performs</li>
            <li> I use it every day - it&#x27;s more porous than alternative sponges and allows for more even coverage.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and I love how it applies my foundation</li>
            <li> I love using this for blending my concealer.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> beauty blenders have changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but in the end I like brushes better for those.</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on more evenly and stays on throughout the day better.</li>
            <li> It does help, like any sponge would, but I find my airbrush concealer brush to work much better for contouring my face and blending in</li>
            <li> is 2.5 to 4.5 minutes too many.  </li>
            <li> I find I use 30-50% more foundation than when using my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It does soak up more than a bit of product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this sponge applies my liquid</li>
            <li> Sigma brush is much better imo.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it as directed...</li>
            <li> I love the way it works though.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see how it would make my makeup application any better, or easier.</li>
            <li> I really love these sponges and I can&#x27;t do my makeup without them anymore.</li>
            <li> My make up looks so much better because of this.</li>
            <li> Using the beautyblender, my makeup goes farther and looks better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the instructions though</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Although white is not the best color choice..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with all beauty blenders</li>
            <li> Whether it is or not, it works great for me, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Most people would think like i did that its just a makeup sponge...</li>
            <li> Love Beautyblender sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> The one that I received was not an authentic beautyblender sponge.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blender</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li> This is something much more than that.</li>
            <li> I want 10 more</li>
            <li> it was stunning at blending in my concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVVVVEEEE the beauty blender!!!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these!!!</li>
            <li> The PURE blender is amazing!</li>
            <li> Over priced but works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Best beauty product I&#x27;ve purchased in as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I feel so gorgeous in my foundation for the first time EVER.</li>
            <li> I feel so gorgeous in my foundation for the first time EVER.</li>
            <li> so I will be excited to see how that works!</li>
            <li> Cannot replace the original with knockoffs!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you run it under cool water after use!  </li>
            <li> For days when I want more coverage it is easy to build your foundation as desired without it looking caked on.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to squish</li>
            <li> It makes blending much more easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and gives a nice finish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It also washes clean very easily by hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best make up tool ever, I use this for almost all of my loose powders and liquids</li>
            <li> But i like that there is no dye and that its so neutral and pure looking (again when clean... lol)</li>
            <li> More time between cleanings &#x3D; more work to clean.</li>
            <li> It does, however, offer a smooth, even application that is somewhat akin to, but  ever so slightly better that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail for it.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee, loooooove, loooooove nice, light weight, and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This SPONGE did not work any better than the cheap wedges one can buy.  </li>
            <li> I have used this sponge lightly damp as suggested by many people.</li>
            <li> and how easily it gets</li>
            <li> Easy to use easy to wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> in fact, I would say its cleared up a bit because the sponge is so easy to clean out every couple of days. :)</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to blend my makeup.  </li>
            <li> The shape gets into every nook and cranny of your face easily.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> It works wonders and is important to clean to prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> After using it the first time, I noticed it does give a nice airbrush like finish.</li>
            <li> had just purchased the new ABH cream contour kit in medium and was waiting for a good applicator sponge to begin using it.</li>
            <li> The Black one is used with complexion products, long-wear makeup, and self-tanners for flawless results.</li>
            <li> It still works fine, but the blender wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I thought.</li>
            <li> and Revlon &amp;#34;24 hour color-stay&amp;#34; and it blended them fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase the cleaner, but I did use dawn dish detergent and that works fine.</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing cracks in the sponge at the spot I use it most, it still applies my foundations amazingly but after about 6 months I suggest buying a new one...</li>
            <li> I use less product and get nice even coverage that looks great.</li>
            <li> Super easy to keep clean and blends everything to perfection!</li>
            <li> While it less than impressed me with liquids, I was surprised to find that I truly loved it for applying powers and blushes.  </li>
            <li> I immediately clean my beautyblender after I&#x27;ve finished using it every time and have never had any problems with my makeup becoming discolored or not applying evenly, and the product hasn&#x27;t caused skin irritation as a result.  </li>
            <li> The shape is especially nice because you can fit in tight spaces on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to try it!</li>
            <li> Can easily adjust make-up, washes out clean.  </li>
            <li> This helped filled them in and minimized the appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just go with a cheap sponge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean easily (even with BeautyBlender product).</li>
            <li> The skin looks so smooth and not cakey at all.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between the cheap sponges you can buy at target or any drug store.</li>
            <li> Mine is stain free also still</li>
            <li> So smooth and no spotty makeup patches</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really DOES do an amazing job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, just soap and water</li>
            <li> It gives me an incredibly smooth and natural-looking application.  </li>
            <li> It feels like cheap foam.</li>
            <li> Applies make up evenly and in easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted a dupe, I would have bought a cheap dupe.</li>
            <li> excellent if I got a wee bit heavy</li>
            <li> I have never gotten my foundation to look this natural or this flattering, just when I was about to give up foundation for good.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten my foundation to look this natural or this flattering, just when I was about to give up foundation for good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> I wanted, nay good sir, NEEDED a BeautyBlender, to see the magical majesty it would take my daily makeup routine to.</li>
            <li> Received  it right on time:-)</li>
            <li> It does a great job, same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> Never looks like a mask, but you easily get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (only when it&#x27;s clean lol).</li>
            <li> Keeping it clean and bacteria free is important, so you will clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li> I DO find this highly superior to using a brush or &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; make up sponge, but not significantly better than a good fingertip</li>
            <li> I HAD to try it, and was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to be gentle with it!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the beauty blender I watch U boxing videos on YouTube to make sure I was getting the real deal, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Was excited when I received the Beauty Blender sponge.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I believe the dye in the original one broke out my skin.</li>
            <li> These will do a better job of getting the stains out verses using your cleanser and are much cheaper than splurging on the beauty blender one!</li>
            <li> The payoff is worth it!</li>
            <li> The payoff is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I think these blenders are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Pure version since I loved the sponge so much.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started being diligent about keeping it clean, it stopped deteriorating.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny, flawlessly applies foundation and cream blush without leaving harsh demarcation lines.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best makeup related purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t clean it immediately after applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> Clean it with a liquid soap or dish soap.</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on thick and smooth - basically flawless.  </li>
            <li> Honestly my hand can produce similar but better application.</li>
            <li> Taken care of appropriately, the Beauty Blender will last you a long time and keep you looking flawless.</li>
            <li> to clean, I love the white since I heard the pink color bleeds when cleaning the original, and blends everything perfectly!</li>
            <li> I loved what it did for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy the white one if you have a neurotic tick about things being clean and/or not stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a non-brand beauty sponge before but didn&#x27;t get nearly the amazing coverage this one does.</li>
            <li> really love it ^^ ..was really scared of it getting stained ...</li>
            <li> Everything u have heard about the bob is true.</li>
            <li> and I honestly have no use for any of my old foundation and concealer brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> Reviews on this are true.</li>
            <li> I had heard only good things about the beautyblender sponge in my online makeup group.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one, and I will try to be more gentle with it.</li>
            <li> ( light coverage, Prescriptives Virtual Skin) and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who wants to make the most of their makeup and get a poreless look.</li>
            <li> Using this sponge (at the pointy end, for crevices) does have benefit of being more gentle on the eye area (where one should avoid tugging, etc).  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this, but I have to say IT REALLY IS FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> so I always wear full coveraged foundations.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product because it&#x27;s used by so many people</li>
            <li> Good product for makeup, soft &amp; easy used, I like it too Mach, I well buy more a next month.</li>
            <li> This has helped significantly in getting a smooth, consistent finish with my mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li> The white color is not worth paying more, but this product is wonderful for putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> This worked better with more sheer, thinner consistency foundation.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping no issues.</li>
            <li> to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> because I read it was best for sensitive skin and did not have the color transfer issues I&#x27;d read  about with the pink one.</li>
            <li> If only there was a flat side with this softness, then it would be perfect!  </li>
            <li> I notice many professional make up artists use them which is a good visual recommendation.</li>
            <li> I find that it gives me a much more natural finish than using a brush, and is also easier to clean than bristles.</li>
            <li> This little makeup sponge applies your foundation so smoothly, it is just amazing!</li>
            <li> Ordered a new one IMMEDIATELY... with an AirPort case. :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really easy and convenient to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY!</li>
            <li> I even had some left over on my hand because I assumed it would take more!</li>
            <li> I even had some left over on my hand because I assumed it would take more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super bummed, the transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to try it!is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get another at a great discount as it applies foundation flawlessly especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I first owned and used the original pink beauty blender and loved it, but my skin didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d heard great things about this little number.</li>
            <li> Love the Pure better than the Pro that I recently purchased.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone comparing this to a store bought sponge, the actual authentic beauty blender is a huge step up</li>
            <li> I feel that I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, and will reorder when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I had watched several Youtube videos explaining how to use the BeautyBlender effectively.</li>
            <li> and you want a more natural looking foundation</li>
            <li> and you want a more natural looking foundation</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a more natural soap (dr bronners liquid Castile soap) but have heard of success using Dawn dish soap too.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!1</li>
            <li> I believe the beauty blender is worth 15.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to spend more $ in the meantime and order a blender directly from beauty blender and compare</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its kind of gross.</li>
            <li> It is costly as sponges go, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is heaven and totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure if my skin is sensitive to it although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that ...</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot recommend it enough, I&#x27;ve never been more impressed by a product.</li>
            <li> The knockoff I received was more elongated and had a more sharply pointed tip.</li>
            <li> It performs far better than my high quality foundation brush or my fairly cheap Ulta sponges.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m sure after the next time I clean it, it will come out.</li>
            <li> I would just make sure you clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have used all the imitation beauty blenders and even though they were great, they don&#x27;t compare to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Those who are unimpressed, I&#x27;m guessing, are not using it the right way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing special.</li>
            <li> Its super super super soft.</li>
            <li> : 01/01/15: after buying a true beauty blender I can say this one is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> My makeup looks more natural, def going to keep purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this as her birthday present and said that it works seamlessly to blend her makeup!  </li>
            <li> I honestly can not believe I waited so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li> tears easily - seems of lesser quality than originally manufactured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this sponge and any other one when you dab or pat instead of using more of a wiping motion.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wet it though!!! :)</li>
            <li> I looooove the pure BB!</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean especially if you rinse it well after you use it each time.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a nice air brushed look and apply my foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li> The material that it&#x27;s made out of is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily.</li>
            <li> Does not do a great job of blending and is kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Using brushes can be more harsh on the skin, more pulling and tugging, hold bacteria, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular makeup sponges, but this really blends nicely.  </li>
            <li> I do keep mine clean with beautyblender cleanser, which works just fine to get it back to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was VERY gentle, followed cleaning instructions to a T, etc.</li>
            <li> The material is super soft and looks like it could easily rip if too much pressure is used in those spots, so I pulled the blender out carefully and instead of pushing it back into the plastic to store it, I just sat it on top to see if the indents will come out on their own.</li>
            <li> I watched many tutorial videos prior to using to ensure I was applying</li>
            <li> Theoretically speaking I could see how it would help, as instead of &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; the foundation in you&#x27;re more &amp;#34;blotting&amp;#34; the foundation on, which would fill the pore instead of just cover it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also tore one of the first times I washed it.</li>
            <li> If/when it wears out, I will definitely order another as I like the way my foundation looks; better than a brush.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This thing is EXACTLY like those.</li>
            <li> There anre many copies of this item but none are the same.  </li>
            <li> Great product.. Not much more to say haha</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be at your sink for an hour trying to get all of the soap out if you use too much!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they put a cheap sponge inside.</li>
            <li> but more than likely I will not be repurchasing it because I still find myself reaching for my brush when using this.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first application with this beauty blender</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic tool for people who have sensitive skin, acne prone, etc.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it!</li>
            <li> They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over a year and probably would have lasted longer had it not dropped in the bathroom</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with applying makeup.</li>
            <li> At first I also used it for my blush and powder</li>
            <li> ripped the first week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the flawless look</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to use at first but went on Utube and saw tutorials on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, within the first week it started to fall apart (rips, chunks falling out, etc)...</li>
            <li> but OMG it was way more, i don&#x27;t know what they do to make it different</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I&#x27;m googly-eyed in LOVE.</li>
            <li> I will play with it more, I only had it for a month.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally got my hands on one of these beauties!</li>
            <li> I loved my beauty blender for the few weeks I had it.</li>
            <li> I found a good hydrating foundation and with this sponge I have no problems at all with uneven coverage or flakes.</li>
            <li> kabuki brush is still a good product if you need heavy coverage to hide a lot of pimples or redness, but if you don&#x27;t need a lot of make up</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is still a good product if you need heavy coverage to hide a lot of pimples or redness, but if you don&#x27;t need a lot of make up</li>
            <li> I clean mine periodically with my all natural Castile soap (dr bronners) and all the stains disappear!</li>
            <li> I cut that sponge straight up thru the middle and now it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> They smell better, are easier to clean (i.e. more product comes out leaving them less stained), and last longer.</li>
            <li> On the positive side....</li>
            <li> However, if you are on a budget I wouldn&#x27;t get this product, just because I don&#x27;t think it works any better than your traditional beauty wedge that you can find really cheap at your local store.</li>
            <li> However, I do love the flat side of the Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li> I use this with my favorite foundation, and as long as I&#x27;m using it, I will continue to use this beautyblender.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Beauty Blender because I was a few bucks short of my free super-saving shipping on an order and had heard good things about it.</li>
            <li> The white one is a bit of a pain to keep looking clean, but as long as you do clean it after each use it is fine.</li>
            <li> I find the Pure Beautybenders to be far better than the original pink ones.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions and wet it first.</li>
            <li> I was kind of put off by the price at first, but decided it was an investment and curiosity killed the cat</li>
            <li> I have some areas of large pores around my nasal folds.</li>
            <li> the pure version</li>
            <li> the pure can be used for skin treatment products or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I cannot live without the Beauty Blender!!</li>
            <li> This product certainly doesn&#x27;t justify the high cost!</li>
            <li> try to let the sponge souk the liquid soup , then squeeze it  and rub it gently in your hand  as much as you need and rinse</li>
            <li> I really like this beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I also use it to blend my concealer and it works very well for that</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s better to use it wet anyway</li>
            <li> Makes a much easier job of putting on tinted moisturizer or foundation.  </li>
            <li> it blends your makeup in really well..</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> (1) I used to use my fingertips, and I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much makeup as I do now.</li>
            <li> one from a seller with 100% feedback - Lock &amp; Mane sells real beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> and I was SO blown away that I went straight here to write this review.</li>
            <li> and I got really</li>
            <li> The difference is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up).</li>
            <li> Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it.</li>
            <li> if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up).</li>
            <li> Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it.</li>
            <li> No different from the cheap wedge though.</li>
            <li> Too much money for a &#x27;sponge&#x27;</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for the amount of work</li>
            <li> One thing that I noticed people were forgetting to do is make sure that the sponge is wet before you use it.</li>
            <li> Its the real beauty blender</li>
            <li> really any makeup product.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This does not as it is very porous and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blend very well</li>
            <li> I much prefer applying foundation, blush, concealer, etc.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that gives me such a smooth and even foundation application.</li>
            <li> Then I came across a foundation that I really wanted to like, but it wasn&#x27;t applying very well on my face.  </li>
            <li> Works so well highly recommend !</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I think the sponge is absorbing my concealer and foundation as I&#x27;m trying to blend out the concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think I will just stick to my concealer brush that works really well.</li>
            <li> I have both and bought this white one thinking it would be nice to have an all white blender.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t expand as much when wet as the authentic sponge.</li>
            <li> ALSO - be sure to air dry them before storing them!!</li>
            <li> WOW, again a must have!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same).</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re careful and make sure to avoid any fingernail contact when you&#x27;re washing it, it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I recommend this because the blender will last MUCH longer if you keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> Better than other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> And keep in mind, some foundations just may work better with one over the other.  </li>
            <li> (I clean mine every 2 days of use and just use regular cleanser and water.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from this seller absorbs way too much product, and is 2-3 times larger than a true beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> I do clean it with my brush cleaner and/or baby soap regularly.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Good makeup tool, does get dirty easily though.</li>
            <li> Very soft, much softer than my Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li> i used it  4 times  with 2 different foundations ( revlon colorstay and l&#x27;oreal true match ).</li>
            <li> If you want full coverage with this, you are going to have to go back over areas.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a personal preference and bone structure, not a knock against the blender :) I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at a local boutique and paid ten dollars more then on amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not going to last and for this amount of money one would expect it to last  through more than maybe 15 uses, washing it gently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of acne scars left from a mildly severe cystic acne breakout)</li>
            <li> I would rather pay the extra money if I know for a fact that the one I&#x27;m getting is real and worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Makes my make up very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is evenly blended and my skin looks very velvety and silky</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3-4 times a week and love it!</li>
            <li> I truly had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge, but it&#x27;s pricy.</li>
            <li> I love this, it really can make your store brand makeup look a lot nicer if you aply it correctly with this little guy!</li>
            <li> Sadly, the cat got on the counter and decided it made a great cat toy so this one is a replacement.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this product really delivers in creating a natural finish.</li>
            <li> In my experience there is absolutely no comparison between this sponge and a cheap sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order to try and avoid having it fall apart completely, I can&#x27;t wash it very thoroughly</li>
            <li> A bit messy, with the fingers when makeup soaks through the sponge, but I use this daily; washes it every three days or so by using a gentle soap and running warm water over the sponge.  </li>
            <li> With proper treatment this will last a long time and it more than worth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, this is a nice blender, but it didn&#x27;t change my life, at least not for that price point.</li>
            <li> I was definitely weary about a $15 &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; but trust me its worth every penny</li>
            <li> I clean it with a mild soap every few days and it is holding up well so far.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not the normal egg shape.</li>
            <li> I get pretty much the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine came out a little dented and after the first wash (I squeezed it as gently as I could when wringing it out), the teardrop shape quickly became warped.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I use a foundation for dry skin so the formula is more oily, I dont know how well it will wash out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was slightly cheaper than the original pink blender and was touted to be better for sensitive skin, with the added benefit of zero dye bleeding.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one with the mini +</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the type</li>
            <li> and it looks new again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the trick to getting it clean is to put the cleaning liquid in the palm of your hand ,wet the sponge and then just like you are applying  the foundation  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: wet the sponge, squeeze out excess water and squeeze in a clean towel before using each time.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my makeup looks and will continue to use this little sponge!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you do use dawn detergent, be sure to only use a TINY TINY bit, because it IS a concentrated soap.</li>
            <li> Two days later I received my package (thanks Prime!)</li>
            <li> Sure its not magical...</li>
            <li> I bought this in comparison to the cheaper version (4 pack monster blender one) and it does the exact same thing as this \\&quot;just 1\\&quot; sponge.</li>
            <li> The white one is so pretty</li>
            <li> my application: FLAWLESSS and NATURAL!</li>
            <li> mismatched combinations of all of the above in blistering hot water, repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Expect to use a little more makeup than you usually do because the sponge does soak it up pretty well, but its worth it, because the end result gives you a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I did not want to buy the BeautyBlender Cleanser (liquid or solid) when I have used any of the above mentioned to clean a variety of brushes to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I clean mine every other use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and absorbs way more product than a normal beauty blender should.</li>
            <li> I heard the white one is better because of there being less chemicals.</li>
            <li> However I have only had it for a short amount of time and it seems to be deteriorating before my eyes, doesn&#x27;t look very pretty.</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge and purchases this BeautyBlender Pure.</li>
            <li> but this one is too little to fit into drying holder.....:</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the BeautyBlender I was using cheap wedge sponges that tended to leave little sponge pieces all over my face.</li>
            <li> It just seemed pricey to me for a sponge, but I am glad I finally invested in this little guy.</li>
            <li> But this one is really hard and it absorb way more product</li>
            <li> You use entirely too much product to ever warrant using this thing.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried using an knock-off brands, as I read unfavorable reviews on some, but I do not regret spending the extra money on &amp;#34;the real thing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> how can a simple sponge get so much hype.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t be dealing with dyes--so far, my sensitive skin has not had any reactions...</li>
            <li> It is so soft and make up becomes so blendable when using this product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all soft and stuff.</li>
            <li> (Easily fixed.)  </li>
            <li> The beauty blender is soft and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> plan on asking a few makeup artist friends of mine if this is just how the dye free one is, or if I received a knockoff, and updating my review.</li>
            <li> Makes makeup application seamless.</li>
            <li> Unless you have an old one that is being trashed anyways, then go ahead.</li>
            <li> Unless you have an old one that is being trashed anyways, then go ahead.</li>
            <li> The green minis are used for the inner eye corners, brow bones, sides of nose, cheeks, and more.</li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately 4 months and it is still holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Its so soft to the touch, puts on foundation like no other!</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of water and the beautycleanser and just make sure all the suds are out before letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot recommend it enough, I&#x27;ve never been more impressed by a product.y around the dry spots of my face, (I mean dry flaky skin, not just dry areas)</li>
            <li> have every type of sponge and foundation brush they make: high end to low end.</li>
            <li> I bought the white sponge to apply highly pigmented goo to my face.</li>
            <li> It works like no other sponge I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> One thing I would say is that though the pink one is cute get the white one because the pink can leak color.</li>
            <li> (If you order from amazon directly, not just fulfilled by amazon, you will also find a real one)</li>
            <li> I usually get it from sephora, but I thought I would order this dye free one.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is my favorite tool to apply foundation and the white one doesn&#x27;t bleed the pink color like the pink one does!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first, I ordered this one due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use a flat top kabuki (buffer) brush to apply my foundation</li>
            <li> This little thing makes applying foundation effortless and quick.</li>
            <li> This kit includes: 1 beautyblender® pure sponge, 1 solid cleanser, 1.0 oz., and 1 white organza bag.</li>
            <li> My foundation dries very quickly and is hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> The Pure is reference to the purity of a white product and the absence of dyes I guess.</li>
            <li> Flat kabuki brush was the first thing I tried, and it buffed my make up out easily and left a heavy coverage that looked better than it would have if I&#x27;d have attempted it with a generic make up sponge and with less product waste.</li>
            <li> It was received in what appeared to be real packaging, but the sponge did appear a slightly different shade of white from the original beauty blenders I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I found out the pure beautyblender is made for sensitive skin if you cant use dyes and also it is made for applying complexion products, serums, eye treatments, moisturizers, makeup removers, and any other skincare product. .</li>
            <li> When slightly damp, they work better and absorb less of your makeup.</li>
            <li> Clean it after it has dried, like the next morning or at bed time.</li>
            <li> this particular blender is only 3/4 the size of the same one</li>
            <li> As a person myself who only wears concealer this made my makeup look seamless and creaseless.</li>
            <li> Works very well… gives that airbrushed look with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> any barely deposits any on my face.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps after the glowing reviews I was expecting miracles and I&#x27;m still just the same old me.  </li>
            <li> Inc.  I definitely learned my lesson to not buy a beautyblender unless I know it came directly from the manufacturer to the retail location that I&#x27;m purchasing from.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not sure about splurging on the original, try out the white one.</li>
            <li> I mean the box if prerry easy to open</li>
            <li> After having bought the real beautyblender multiple times from a different retailer, I was able to spot that this was a fake before I even opened the package.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to clean and take out the stains.</li>
            <li> When wet, this sponge was smaller than the original and did not work to properly apply makeup products as expected.</li>
            <li> They look the same but the foam on copies is no different than old timey foam squares.</li>
            <li> I tore the package open like a wild animal and opened up my BeautyBlender instantly.</li>
            <li> Item received was a fake, NOT the Original Beauty Blender Pure as ordered.</li>
            <li> , I ordered two because they were less than purchasing them at Sephora (the only place that sells them, that I&#x27;m aware of).</li>
            <li> wet first, towel dry, then apply the foundation in a stippling (bouncing) manner.</li>
            <li> The finish it gives you and its blending ability is much the same as any other sponge, so I wont be investing in this product again.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> + on a cosmetic sponge, but when I saw the Beauty Blender PURE on Amazon for about half the price, I purchased...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, I bought the white color after reading the pink may bleed.</li>
            <li> It has very small pores which sets it apart from many other sponges.</li>
            <li> The thicker foundation really caused caking, and random dark spots where there was more of a product build-up, as (mentioned above)</li>
            <li> This was such a great purchase, I&#x27;m only disappointed I didn&#x27;t start buying these puppies earlier.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that if you wet ALL beautyblenders, they swell but when it dries it goes back to its original size of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;The pink beauty blender is used for primers, foundations, powders, cream blushes, and any other complexion product.</li>
            <li> Even though I bought the white \\&quot;pure\\&quot; blender, the stains are completely removed after a single wash.</li>
            <li> This will also shred minutes off of your makeup routine no matter how little or how much makeup you put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original pink BeautyBlender, but the white option just appealed to me more (less scary pink dye maybe?).</li>
            <li> I chose the pure because I heard the pink one can stain counters or other surfaces it is left out on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get the white one completely clean</li>
            <li> I mean its a beauty sponge right?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not smart and slightly annoying that they would write a negative review of this product when it was most likely their own negligence that caused the issues.</li>
            <li> The plastic that the blender sits in is jagged and the blender was pushed so far down into it that it left indents in it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is real</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews before purchasing and was surprised at first by the small size.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought both a flat Kabuki brush from beauty junkees and this sponge.</li>
            <li> Thought that was a given, apparently not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Thought that was a given, apparently not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its because it is not the real thing, or because it is made differently than the pink one, but it does not apply makeup the same.</li>
            <li> The only cons are the price, and that you need to leave it out in the air to dry to avoid mold.</li>
            <li> if you use the standard shipping, it will arrive way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wet it, add a few drops of soap, gently massage it in, rinse and repeat</li>
            <li> Wet it, add a few drops of soap, gently massage it in, rinse and repeat</li>
            <li> Upset I even paid this much especially when the results were no different than any other sponge.  </li>
            <li> I did not rate this five stars only because it is difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> so it comes out in little circles of foundation) and the bb absorbed it in too deep because I pressed too hard.</li>
            <li> I will say that this white Beauty Blender is a bit difficult to clean, but it still works the same as the pink one.</li>
            <li> It really does give an airbrushed-looking finish, at least with the foundation I use (Revlon Colorstay Whipped).</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try beauty blenders for a long time but something about beauty blenders when I try to blend out my concealer or contour it leaves like this blotchy looking caked up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and has a pink and a white one.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost 3in big when wet.</li>
            <li> The texture is entirely different from the pink beauty blender.</li>
            <li> This is slowing down the breakdown, but having only had it for maybe 3 or 4 weeks, I&#x27;m concerned that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last another 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I mean who wants to spend $20 on a makeup sponge?</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you&#x27;re serious about makeup!</li>
            <li> Very soft but too small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that had the same issue.</li>
            <li> and I will not be going back to using anything other then this.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use the beauty blender... and find some other use for my foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to get one!</li>
            <li> It looked tiny and thought it would be too small to blend quickly, but once you wet it, it increases in size at least 50%.</li>
            <li> Allow it to dry, and then put the lid on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Allow it to dry, and then put the lid on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also tried this dry.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s absolutely gross to use this white one to apply foundation, because it looks really messy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smaller than those regular ones (pink, purple and black).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while now, and use this every single day.</li>
            <li> I was stunned at the results, I did half of my face with the beauty blender and the other half with a high end brush.</li>
            <li> I found it to provide the same coverage as your average, quality foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I was just planning on covering only a few problem areas after the make up mess the kabuki left, but as soon as I started to dab it on my skin and saw how different it looked, I kept going.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using a regular store bought make up sponge which I assumed the beauty blender would be a slightly better version of, holy crap</li>
            <li> cons are that it is impossible to not get it stained, that it has to be washed after every single use, and that it forces you to use more product than if you were just using your fingers.</li>
            <li> The ROYAL (purple) one is the same due to it being a Sephora + Beauty Blender limited edition collab due to the color of the year.</li>
            <li> I previously used Mac Longwear and a regular applicator sponge.</li>
            <li> On my last cleaning, underneath the makeup I saw black mold.</li>
            <li> However, when you use it damp, it expands slightly and looks like the proper size when placed against the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your product becomes slightly discolored even with regular cleansing, it still shouldn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
            <li> If you get close enough you can still tell you&#x27;re wearing make up, especially around the dry spots of my face, (I mean dry flaky skin, not just dry areas)</li>
            <li> I have very dry flaky skin</li>
            <li> With this product , however not one single smudge!</li>
            <li> which is like 3 inches wide and 4 inches tall.  </li>
            <li> I do have some staining but that was expected.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t even rough with it</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I also noticed every time I cleaned the pink one it leaked the pink color.</li>
            <li> I even paid extra for one day delivery because I am impatient to get this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my pink beauty blenders bleed.</li>
            <li> It didnt bleed any color when you rinsed it like the pink one does.</li>
            <li> Get the pink.  </li>
            <li> I like this sponge because it is as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does hold the color so if you&#x27;re skitchy about that, well, maybe go with a purple or pink one.</li>
            <li> You MUST get it wet</li>
            <li> There is no real information as to why this one is marketed as &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> with a porous sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a smart woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn</li>
            <li> Folks, DO NOT store it in a closed container while wet!</li>
            <li> Folks, DO NOT store it in a closed container while wet!</li>
            <li> Even though the pores are small, it also doesn&#x27;t smudge like some sponges do that have closed pores which actually just move the product around on the skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sponges that stay hard and harsh when you wet them, the beauty blender turns into a soft makeup dream!</li>
            <li> Just too pricey for such a small thing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for any other product but my concealer, as I don&#x27;t wear much other</li>
            <li> I thought it was just like any other sponge</li>
            <li> I usually put foundation on the back of my hand (I use a foundation with a pump</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about purchasing this item, because let&#x27;s face it-</li>
            <li> but I did not want to use it as the other items were not included.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate that there appear to be so many fake products being sold through Amazon as it&#x27;s such a convenient way to order.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have bought the PINK 1?!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beauty blender\\&quot; seemed like any other sponge to me...</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t like it, it was only a small loss.</li>
            <li> I kept the packaging so that when I rinse the sponge after using, it will air dry on the little stand.</li>
            <li> The thing is that sometimes when I apply the foundation with my hands, I can still little dry flakes peeking through.</li>
            <li> , a very careful fingertip application.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I noticed an odd &#x27;squeaky&#x27; quality with the wet sponge when squeezing and manipulating.</li>
            <li> Becasue it has to be wet, you use less product, which saves you money in the end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried other beauty sponges before thinking that they&#x27;re all the same, but after finding a beautyblender for a little cheaper than usual, i thought i&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if you got within 2-3 feet of my face, I looked like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> not sure why i waited so long to purchase this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper versions at least in my opinion do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must have been possessed by a thrifty beauty guru of days long past when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Will defiantly buy another one when mine runs down.</li>
            <li> I was lazy about it and the top part started looking bad and crumbled a little.  </li>
            <li> which is good, because it&#x27;s not on my face, but bad when you use expensive foundation.</li>
            <li> and you use even less product than if you use your fingers.</li>
            <li> None the less</li>
            <li> It seriously looks like a second skin.</li>
            <li> The indents I mentioned previously came out after I wetted the bb.</li>
            <li> Purity Gel Cleanser by Philosophy, MAC Brush Cleaner, Baby Shampoo, Olive Oil, Shea Moisture Bar Soap (the black one)</li>
            <li> I am confused how this is different from any other department store sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> However, it is very expensive for one sponge and time will tell if it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a real beauty blender, the texture was weird and it started tearing after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Those little dupes are nothing compared to this baby.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find the little pie shape wedges that I use to use, so I went to a brush.  </li>
            <li> I had been having a difficult time achieving the natural look that I wanted until I started using this!</li>
            <li> this little thing does</li>
            <li> Little did I know...</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with my foundation looking a little cakey</li>
            <li> I bought this beauty blender on a limb from Amazon because at the time of purchase, was a few dollars cheaper than a beauty blender at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used every method to apply it from wedges, round sponges,brushes, my fingers etc.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few foundation brushes...</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s not a cure all for uneven skin</li>
            <li> It ripped when I washed it, a few weeks into using it.</li>
            <li> so I was especially careful to find</li>
            <li> When i picked up the item the seal was broken i was like no big deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waste this money on a sponge?</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this being the real deal, being a bit less expensive than usual, but it&#x27;s definitely legit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when wet, it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> At this point I really thought it was impossible to wear foundation and have it look like you weren&#x27;t caked in make up</li>
            <li> Not unless it was at least half this</li>
            <li> If you wear liquid makeup this little blender is a must!</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use concealer on trouble spots, it covers and blends so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed I paid so much for it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled in the past with blending concealer , which had often led to embarrassing moments where unknowingly I had creases of makeup all over my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to feel about this beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I do still prefer my small stipple brush when I contour.</li>
            <li> The blender looks extremely small in the packaging, which by the way was dented and looked used (though the blender inside was unmarked).</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
            <li> But I have one small issue.</li>
            <li> it looks small but wen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had counterfeit items sold to me and even FULFILLED BY AMAZON in the past</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really small sponge</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to write this review...</li>
            <li> problem is that it is already loosing it&#x27;s suedelike texture by getting small holes all around it.  </li>
            <li> so you can make it small for every curve and cranny on your face---under eyes, on lids, by the nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I skipped the expensive BeautyBlender cleaner and instead dab/rub it on a bar of soap, rinsing several times to get all the product off.</li>
            <li> Giving it four stars because I think $15 for a sponge is a bit excessive.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> it is not a more ecofriendly version, nor does it come in ecofriendly packaging.</li>
            <li> It was hard to use, stiff, and I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I seriously haven&#x27;t touched any of my brushes after buying this product (though I suggest looking around for comparable products at reduced prices because this is rather pricey if you are on a tight budget).</li>
            <li> it is expensive and  very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> the negative side....</li>
            <li> I ran it under cold water and squeezed out the excess and then pressed it in a towel to soak up all the extra water.</li>
            <li> Also I see negative written reviews of people who claim their beauty blender grew mold.</li>
            <li> Also I see negative written reviews of people who claim their beauty blender grew mold.</li>
            <li> I found it too thick to handle, so I did the UNIMAGINEABLE</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers indicated that it may be a fake.  </li>
            <li> When I got the beautyblender, I was confused on why it was so small.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> just wish it would wash cleaner and was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Idk if ill even try the pink one next time :(</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little bit skeptical about it....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this little egg shaped sponge...</li>
            <li> Yes, you can wash this &#x27;blender&#x27; often, as hard as you can, but the color will remain!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that after weeks of use the only thing the sponge does with my mac  prolong wear concealer under my eyes is take off a layer of foundation and make my cheeks rosy red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be disappointing after all of the hype, but I was not one bit let down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this little crazy sponge.  </li>
            <li> This sponge ups the game of drugstore makeup.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps some of you not be confused</li>
            <li> Mine has not been broken or fallen apart, but I take my time cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Mine has not been broken or fallen apart, but I take my time cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I can adjust the amount of moisture in the blender to thin out thicker foundations.</li>
            <li> only thing I hate is that it stains</li>
            <li> I no longer have those awful foundation lines near my hairline.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and annoyed that it isn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It spreads foundation and/or concealer evenly and fits into weird crevices of undereyes and nose.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy something so expensive to apply my makeup</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Well let me say I was really wrong.</li>
            <li> It is a game changer for me!</li>
            <li> I was  debating if I should by this because they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> I will not return it, but I am definitely not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> After seeing a lot of make up artists that I follow use this product and having a gift card I decided to make the splurge on the expensive sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> the stains from the concealer and foundation make it look dirty, even after washing.</li>
            <li> but I hate having to blend out the lines they leave behind.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical ordering this since it was cheaper than if I bought it in a store.</li>
            <li> (ahah well except for bad break outs)</li>
            <li> (ahah well except for bad break outs)</li>

            <li> The blender is stained and ripped :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender has truly replaced all brushes and applicators for makeup and I am SOOOOO mad that I did not buy one sooner!</li>
            <li> Hate this thing - it rolls all over the stupid counter unless you keep it in the case</li>
            <li> 15 dollars is a lot of money for used crap so pissed</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst part about the blender is that it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for what I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Tried to buy knock offs and they are horrible.  </li>
            <li> but when I purchased this, I was very shocked with the results!</li>
            <li> It is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been wanting to try beauty blenders for a long time but something about beauty blenders when I try to blend out my concealer or contour it leaves like this blotchy looking caked up look and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my concealer or the beauty blender I still haven&#x27;t tried anything else to see what the problem was.. So I&#x27;m a little bit skeptical about it....</li>
            <li> I bought this beauty blender on a limb from Amazon because at the time of purchase, was a few dollars cheaper than a beauty blender at Sephora. The beauty blender can apply almost any face makeup, concealer, foundation, even cream blush. As a person myself who only wears concealer this made my makeup look seamless and creaseless. I have struggled in the past with blending concealer , which had often led to embarrassing moments where unknowingly I had creases of makeup all over my face. With this product , however not one single smudge! This will also shred minutes off of your makeup routine no matter how little or how much makeup you put on. Instead of struggling with your fingers or a concealer brush beauty blender is the way to go !</li>
            <li> A bit messy, with the fingers when makeup soaks through the sponge, but I use this daily; washes it every three days or so by using a gentle soap and running warm water over the sponge.  Please do not leave this in the contain covered, if you&#x27;re going to keep it in the container keep the lid open.</li>
            <li> Best makeup blender. I use with revlon colorstay for a perfectly flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and invest in a beauty blender. Those little dupes are nothing compared to this baby. I will never put foundation on the same way again.</li>
            <li> Can easily adjust make-up, washes out clean.  I wash mine each day by rubbing it on a bar of Dove soap and rinsing it.  Doesn&#x27;t stain.  I leave it in the container it came in.  Sadly, the cat got on the counter and decided it made a great cat toy so this one is a replacement.</li>
            <li> This beauty blender is a &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34;. It is not a trademarked like the one that you can purchase at your local sephora. I have both and bought this white one thinking it would be nice to have an all white blender. I was WRONG! It&#x27;s hard and absorbs way more product than a normal beauty blender should. I&#x27;m looking into getting my money back. I truly had high hopes. Back to my local sephora I go. If I could give it zero stars, I would!!!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using my fingers to apply foundation. This beautyblener ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tools. Blends effortlessly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best applicator I&#x27;ve ever used. I previously used Mac Longwear and a regular applicator sponge. Now I use Revlon and this; it&#x27;s even better coverage than Mac now. This sponge ups the game of drugstore makeup. I hardly have to use concealer on trouble spots, it covers and blends so well. The only thing is I use a foundation for dry skin so the formula is more oily, I dont know how well it will wash out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I was weary because I thought it would be just like my off-brand blender but it was much better. It looked tiny and thought it would be too small to blend quickly, but once you wet it, it increases in size at least 50%.</li>
            <li> really love it ^^ ..was really scared of it getting stained ...but to my surprise it didn&#x27;t !!! i used it  4 times  with 2 different foundations ( revlon colorstay and l&#x27;oreal true match ). it works like a dream ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trick to getting it clean is to put the cleaning liquid in the palm of your hand ,wet the sponge and then just like you are applying  the foundation  try to let the sponge souk the liquid soup , then squeeze it  and rub it gently in your hand  as much as you need and rinse that’s it  ^___^ ..do it again if needed ^^..&lt;br /&gt;p.s&lt;br /&gt;i just cleaned mine now ^__^ looks good yay</li>
            <li> this is a great blending sponge.. I use it to blend everything..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to feel about this beauty blender. So it&#x27;s absolutely gross to use this white one to apply foundation, because it looks really messy and it&#x27;s smaller than those regular ones (pink, purple and black). It&#x27;s actually designed to apply moisturizer and primer.. but honestly I prefer using my fingers..</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. However I have only had it for a short amount of time and it seems to be deteriorating before my eyes, doesn&#x27;t look very pretty. Perhaps it is because I did not have the proper cleanser but my foundation is permanently stained. I ordered a new one with the mini + the cleanser so I will be excited to see how that works!</li>
            <li> Description says nothing about this being a mini size blender! Waste of time and money. Returning.</li>
            <li> Superb makeup application!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have been hearing absolutely amazing things about the beautify blender. I HAD to try it, and was so excited when it arrived. I have some areas of large pores around my nasal folds. I was hoping that this would help with that, as it&#x27;s often touted as doing a great job at pore minimization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be honest...I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. Many of the reviews say it gives a great, airbrush finish. I personally didn&#x27;t get those results. I found it to provide the same coverage as your average, quality foundation brush. I watched many tutorial videos prior to using to ensure I was applying properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pore reduction, there was not any. Theoretically speaking I could see how it would help, as instead of &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; the foundation in you&#x27;re more &amp;#34;blotting&amp;#34; the foundation on, which would fill the pore instead of just cover it. But this didn&#x27;t work for me. What I DID find worked was using a translucent powder, putting it on the Beauty Blender (after foundation was applied) and blotting over pores. This helped filled them in and minimized the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Beauty Blender using multiple brands of foundation. This worked better with more sheer, thinner consistency foundation. The thicker foundation really caused caking, and random dark spots where there was more of a product build-up, as (mentioned above) you&#x27;re using more of a blotting, sweeping motion instead of rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tore one of the first times I washed it. I was VERY gentle, followed cleaning instructions to a T, etc. That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I really like this beauty blender. It is good quality and I like that it comes with a bar of beauty blender cleanser as well. However, if you are on a budget I wouldn&#x27;t get this product, just because I don&#x27;t think it works any better than your traditional beauty wedge that you can find really cheap at your local store.</li>
            <li> I freaking love my beauty blender. Cannot replace the original with knockoffs!</li>
            <li> I love the Beauty Blender for liquid and cream foundation application.</li>
            <li> Item received was a fake, NOT the Original Beauty Blender Pure as ordered. It was received in what appeared to be real packaging, but the sponge did appear a slightly different shade of white from the original beauty blenders I have bought in the past. When wet, this sponge was smaller than the original and did not work to properly apply makeup products as expected. Additionally, I noticed an odd &#x27;squeaky&#x27; quality with the wet sponge when squeezing and manipulating. Currently following Amazon directions for return.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Arrived quickly.  Would recommend to all buyers.  Once again great product.  Quick shipping no issues.</li>
            <li> Love using this beauty blender. Makes my makeup go on a lot smoother than just using my fingers or a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> tears easily - seems of lesser quality than originally manufactured.</li>
            <li> beauty blender is amazing</li>
            <li> Hate this thing - it rolls all over the stupid counter unless you keep it in the case it came in - which is like 3 inches wide and 4 inches tall.  You use entirely too much product to ever warrant using this thing.  I can no longer find the little pie shape wedges that I use to use, so I went to a brush.  It works really well and you use even less product than if you use your fingers.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews I&#x27;ve seen and beauty gurus that use this, it not all that.  You are supposed to get an airbrushed look. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: As the wife and user of this product I have to say that I do love it. It is the only way I apply my foundation now. I use less product and get nice even coverage that looks great. For days when I want more coverage it is easy to build your foundation as desired without it looking caked on. It is easy to clean especially if you rinse it well after you use it each time. More time between cleanings &#x3D; more work to clean. I do have some staining but that was expected. With proper treatment this will last a long time and it more than worth it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> If you wear liquid makeup this little blender is a must!</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge, but it&#x27;s pricy.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without the Beauty Blender!! It spreads foundation and/or concealer evenly and fits into weird crevices of undereyes and nose.  It&#x27;s a beauty addict&#x27;s must-have! One thing I would say is that though the pink one is cute get the white one because the pink can leak color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my beauty blender since January 2015. I use it at least 3-4 times a week and love it! It still blends perfectly and feels brand new. If/when it wears out, I will definitely order another as I like the way my foundation looks; better than a brush. I do still prefer my small stipple brush when I contour. I think it&#x27;s easier and looks better on my face with a brush but it&#x27;s just a personal preference and bone structure, not a knock against the blender :) I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really love this blender.. It works like no other sponge I&#x27;ve ever used! Make sure you wet it though!!! :)</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is amazing. I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without it. It gives my skin a nice air brushed look and apply my foundation very evenly. I also use it to blend my concealer and it works very well for that too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 8 months now and I&#x27;m seeing cracks in the sponge at the spot I use it most, it still applies my foundations amazingly but after about 6 months I suggest buying a new one... still love this sponge</li>
            <li> Love these. They works great for concealer and to blend.</li>
            <li> Best beauty product I own! Worth every penny! It saves a ton of foundation as well, makeup looks flawless!</li>
            <li> Perfect way to apply my liquid foundation, dampen it and it comes out flawless.</li>
            <li> Not like I thought it would be. Just go with a cheap sponge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, this is a nice blender, but it didn&#x27;t change my life, at least not for that price point. Admittedly, I cleaned it with soap and water about once a month. On my last cleaning, underneath the makeup I saw black mold. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that had the same issue.</li>
            <li> Just love the way this applies foundation and concealer.  Read a few reviews before purchasing and was surprised at first by the small size. Follow the directions on cleaning and  usage. I kept the packaging so that when I rinse the sponge after using, it will air dry on the little stand. Highly recommend, I bought the white color after reading the pink may bleed.</li>
            <li> Over priced but works pretty good. Just too pricey for such a small thing</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter and me&lt;br /&gt;she loves it</li>
            <li> I read great reviews but have tried everything.  This did a great job of providing smooth coverage and did not lift the makeup off as you blended.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it appears to be, but it does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Flawless makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this little crazy sponge.  It works effortlessly.  Will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Love my beauty blender !</li>
            <li> This little makeup sponge applies your foundation so smoothly, it is just amazing! I love the way my makeup looks and will continue to use this little sponge!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My foundation goes on evenly and my skin looks flawless.  Make sure you read the instructions and wet it first.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing foundation for years and I&#x27;ve used every method to apply it from wedges, round sponges,brushes, my fingers etc. and NOTHING comes close to how the beauty blender works. This little thing makes applying foundation effortless and quick. I was definitely weary about a $15 &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; but trust me its worth every penny and I will not be going back to using anything other then this.</li>
            <li> At first, I ordered this one due to my sensitive skin. When I got the beautyblender, I was confused on why it was so small. Ladies! DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY! I found out the pure beautyblender is made for sensitive skin if you cant use dyes and also it is made for applying complexion products, serums, eye treatments, moisturizers, makeup removers, and any other skincare product. . You can use it for makeup if you want to. Another thing is that if you wet ALL beautyblenders, they swell but when it dries it goes back to its original size of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;The pink beauty blender is used for primers, foundations, powders, cream blushes, and any other complexion product. The ROYAL (purple) one is the same due to it being a Sephora + Beauty Blender limited edition collab due to the color of the year. I suggest buying that one The Black one is used with complexion products, long-wear makeup, and self-tanners for flawless results. Also, it is not as pointed on the top for contouring. The green minis are used for the inner eye corners, brow bones, sides of nose, cheeks, and more. This youtuber explains here: www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fpm-AC0BWGo  I hope this helps some of you not be confused I as was this morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super bummed, the transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast. However, I&#x27;ve only used it three times and it already has a ripe. I didn&#x27;t buy the cleaner but saw I could use baby shampoo - that didn&#x27;t work. The blender is stained and ripped :( and I wasn&#x27;t even rough with it - I was just squeezing out the water! Idk if ill even try the pink one next time :(</li>
            <li> this particular blender is only 3/4 the size of the same one&lt;br /&gt;i bought at Sephora.  It is so much smaller that it falls into the plastic holder made for drying. It is still the best blender out there, I have tried cheap copies.  They look the same but the foam on copies is no different than old timey foam squares. Beauty blender is the best.  but this one is too little to fit into drying holder.....:(. oh, i spray mine with store bought face mist before putting foundation onto sponge.  saves a firtune in makeup!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was slightly cheaper than the original pink blender and was touted to be better for sensitive skin, with the added benefit of zero dye bleeding. The blender looks extremely small in the packaging, which by the way was dented and looked used (though the blender inside was unmarked). However, when you use it damp, it expands slightly and looks like the proper size when placed against the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blender performs as described and is great for blending away concealer, foundation, and cream makeup of all colors. I find that it gives me a much more natural finish than using a brush, and is also easier to clean than bristles. (I clean mine every 2 days of use and just use regular cleanser and water. Most of the stains come out this way, though you won&#x27;t be able to avoid deeper stains over time. ALSO - be sure to air dry them before storing them!! THIS IS HOW THE MOLD GROWS.) I haven&#x27;t tried traveling with it yet, but it&#x27;s compact enough that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll give me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about the blender is that it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape. Mine came out a little dented and after the first wash (I squeezed it as gently as I could when wringing it out), the teardrop shape quickly became warped. It still works fine, but the blender wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I thought. Keep this in mind when you&#x27;re handling the sponge. (I took off 2 stars for the crappy state it was in --personal experience-- and how easily it gets damaged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not sure about splurging on the original, try out the white one. Just be sure to be gentle with it! Otherwise, this product really delivers in creating a natural finish.</li>
            <li> This has helped significantly in getting a smooth, consistent finish with my mineral makeup.  Very easy to use.  I clean it with a mild soap every few days and it is holding up well so far.  I anticipate several months of use before it needs to be replaced. I have never tried using an knock-off brands, as I read unfavorable reviews on some, but I do not regret spending the extra money on &amp;#34;the real thing.&amp;#34;  I feel that I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, and will reorder when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy something so expensive to apply my makeup but this thing is amazing!!!  It really does apply the makeup smoothly and evenly for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> It is good, although I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price.I only use the beauty blender to blend concealer, as it does that well.  None the less, I ordered two because they were less than purchasing them at Sephora (the only place that sells them, that I&#x27;m aware of). Not sure I&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well for blending make up.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! It has made my foundation go on smoother than it did with a regular makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender applies my foundation FLAWLESSLY! It seriously looks like a second skin. I had been having a difficult time achieving the natural look that I wanted until I started using this!</li>
            <li> Good product for makeup, soft &amp; easy used, I like it too Mach, I well buy more a next month.</li>
            <li> good product just have to wash after every use</li>
            <li> I am confused how this is different from any other department store sponge applicator. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you so much for a timely shipping and a wonderful product. As soon as I got the beauty blender I watch U boxing videos on YouTube to make sure I was getting the real deal, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders. They make my foundation look flawless and allow for great coverage with little effort and amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> NOTHING blends foundation like this product. But a LOT of foundation remains in the sponge....which is good, because it&#x27;s not on my face, but bad when you use expensive foundation. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t be without the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> My advice is to buy the beautyblender cleaner as well....it&#x27;s really easy and convenient to use and works very well.  I recommend this because the blender will last MUCH longer if you keep it clean.  I was lazy about it and the top part started looking bad and crumbled a little.  As soon as I started being diligent about keeping it clean, it stopped deteriorating.  Plus it&#x27;s better to use it wet anyway so drying it out isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> Such wonderful reviews...thought I&#x27;d try it.  Yes, you can wash this &#x27;blender&#x27; often, as hard as you can, but the color will remain!  I don&#x27;t care about that.  The thing I want to see is how manageable it is.  I found it too thick to handle, so I did the UNIMAGINEABLE ---- I cut that sponge straight up thru the middle and now it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Best beauty product I&#x27;ve purchased in as long as I can remember. Makes application of makeup (concealer, for me) easy, quick, and FLAWLESS. I don&#x27;t use it for any other product but my concealer, as I don&#x27;t wear much other makeup- but it is perfect. My only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy two to have a back up... which I would&#x27;ve used as my cat decided he loved it as well. Ordered a new one IMMEDIATELY... with an AirPort case. :)</li>
            <li> I usually use a flat top kabuki (buffer) brush to apply my foundation but I decided to branch out. Years ago, I would use triangle sponges, the ones you get at walmart for like 2 dollars (for around 25 pieces). This thing is EXACTLY like those. Definitely not worth the cash. SAVE YOUR MONEY LADIES</li>
            <li> Love the beautyblender.  Applies foundation smoothly and beautifully.  If you purchase this, definitely get the beautyblender cleanser, it cleans this like a dream!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitations, the beauty blender is the way to go. Unlike other sponges that stay hard and harsh when you wet them, the beauty blender turns into a soft makeup dream! Worth every penny, flawlessly applies foundation and cream blush without leaving harsh demarcation lines.</li>
            <li> Tore within 2 weeks of use. Very disappointed for what I paid for it! Waste of money. Back to the way I&#x27;ve always put foundation on, looks the same.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this tool and was hesitant to buy it, I am glad I did.  Makes a much easier job of putting on tinted moisturizer or foundation.  There anre many copies of this item but none are the same.  I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> Works very well… gives that airbrushed look with minimal effort.  Easy to clean.  I like this much better than brushes or using my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Everything u have heard about the bob is true. Great product.. Not much more to say haha</li>
            <li> Very soft, much softer than my Real Techniques sponge.  However, I do love the flat side of the Real Techniques sponge.  If only there was a flat side with this softness, then it would be perfect!  As it stands, I go back and forth between the two.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle sponge. I used Maybelline &amp;#34;fit me&amp;#34; and Revlon &amp;#34;24 hour color-stay&amp;#34; and it blended them fine. I found that the beauty sponges that are generic work just as well though. I would advise to spend the money on something else.</li>
            <li> I loved my beauty blender for the few weeks I had it. I was watching tutorials online and the one girl said just squeeze it out and put it back in it&#x27;s plastic bin it comes in. It has holes in it seemingly for evaporation so I didn&#x27;t think anything of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it got moldy!!! I am really sad and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be getting another one soon but it is definitely getting left out on the vanity!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gives an air brush finish. It works wonderful for foundation application and concealer application. I like the white color ever tho it&#x27;s hard to clean and take out the stains. I heard the white one is better because of there being less chemicals. I would repurchase. Its super super super soft.</li>
            <li> Blends makeup okay. Doesn&#x27;t clean easily (even with BeautyBlender product). I&#x27;d avoid buying white again.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome... I thought it was just like any other sponge but it is really good it blends your makeup in really well..</li>
            <li> This works really well and is high quality. However, it is very expensive for one sponge and time will tell if it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its so soft to the touch, puts on foundation like no other! Its perfect and so easy to use, I love the weight and shape! This is a product I will always use!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting. The skin looks so smooth and not cakey at all. Great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> I apply my foundation then use this for my under eye concealer but all it does for me is move the makeup around instead of pushing it into my skin</li>
            <li> **********UPDATE**********&lt;br /&gt;So, I finally found time to actually try it out. The indents I mentioned previously came out after I wetted the bb. I used it and it is seriously AMAZING. I also found out that the price it&#x27;s selling for here is waaay cheaper than if you were to get it anywhere else. So I do recommend buying it from this seller. I didn&#x27;t purchase the cleaner, but I did use dawn dish detergent and that works fine. It got out most of the color from my foundation besides two spots. I usually put foundation on the back of my hand (I use a foundation with a pump so it comes out in little circles of foundation) and the bb absorbed it in too deep because I pressed too hard. But i&#x27;m sure after the next time I clean it, it will come out. If you do use dawn detergent, be sure to only use a TINY TINY bit, because it IS a concentrated soap. You&#x27;ll be at your sink for an hour trying to get all of the soap out if you use too much! This product is amazing and I honestly have no use for any of my old foundation and concealer brushes anymore. I will purchase this again once this one goes out of commission. :-) If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********INITIAL REVIEW**********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my beauty blender way earlier than I should have. I used my free 2-day shipping from amazon prime and it arrived the day after I ordered it! So, I&#x27;m pretty sure if you use the standard shipping, it will arrive way earlier than expected. Now, onto the product itself. The packaging is so adorable. But I have one small issue. The plastic that the blender sits in is jagged and the blender was pushed so far down into it that it left indents in it. The material is super soft and looks like it could easily rip if too much pressure is used in those spots, so I pulled the blender out carefully and instead of pushing it back into the plastic to store it, I just sat it on top to see if the indents will come out on their own. The material that it&#x27;s made out of is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily. I haven&#x27;t used it yet on account of the indents but I will post an update on how well I think it works. I&#x27;m super excited to try it!is horrifyingly soft, so I feel like it may rip easily. I haven&#x27;t used it yet on account of the indents but I will post an update on how well I think it works. I&#x27;m super excited to try it!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it does make foundation look very smooth on. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a beauty blender... It just seemed pricey to me for a sponge, but I am glad I finally invested in this little guy. I have quite a few foundation brushes... but I hate having to blend out the lines they leave behind. I love how the beautyblender does just what it&#x27;s name says... BLEND! If you want full coverage with this, you are going to have to go back over areas. I just use this once over my face and then add concealer to areas that need extra coverage. The pointed tip on this sponge is great for under the eye area. I will definitely continue to use the beauty blender... and find some other use for my foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> The best sponge ever. Easy to use easy to wash. I&#x27;m happy with the cuality and the result. Thank you</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between the cheap sponges you can buy at target or any drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the best make up tool ever, I use this for almost all of my loose powders and liquids</li>
            <li> Great make up applicator. Learn the correct way to use it and it works wonderful. Flawless application. I read all the reviews and they convinced me to purchase. Reviews on this are true.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaner.  I use it on my makeup brushes as well as the beauty blender.. I recommend this cleaner, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was iffy about purchasing it but I absolutely love it. Skin is flawless. Spreads evenly. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best makeup related purchase I have ever made. At first I was skeptical about purchasing this item, because let&#x27;s face it- how can a simple sponge get so much hype. After using the BB a couple of times I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with liquid foundation and I am able to achieve a flawless finish. It blends amazingly and I will keep using this item!! Love it cant get enough!&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the off brand sponges but nothing can compare.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at a local boutique and paid ten dollars more then on amazon.  I was pleased to get another at a great discount as it applies foundation flawlessly especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people think for a makeup sponge, spending upwards of $20 doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea, but believe me when I say that YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!! I&#x27;ve tried a dupe from Ulta and it is NOTHING compared to the Beauty Blender. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it really does make any liquid foundation look so flawless and airbrushed. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. I highly recommend this!! Don&#x27;t have any second thoughts, just buy it! Lol.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Does not do a great job of blending and is kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li> On the positive side....Blends my makeup beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side....it is expensive and  very difficult to clean. It holds on to soap unlike anything I have ever seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product but I will explore cheaper options</li>
            <li> Fine. I resisted and resisted purchasing one of these. I just could not justify it. Well let me say I was really wrong. I have very dry flaky skin and I just assumed I could never wear foundation. I found a good hydrating foundation and with this sponge I have no problems at all with uneven coverage or flakes. The white one is a bit of a pain to keep looking clean, but as long as you do clean it after each use it is fine. I personally don&#x27;t care that a sponge is stained.</li>
            <li> I had heard only good things about the beautyblender sponge in my online makeup group. I was kind of put off by the price at first, but decided it was an investment and curiosity killed the cat so I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;I had just purchased the new ABH cream contour kit in medium and was waiting for a good applicator sponge to begin using it. Oh.My.Goodness are these two things together awesome or what?! The beautyblender sponge flawlessly applies the creams and makes my face appear poreless and almost airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and very easy to clean as well. I use a little bit of water and the beautycleanser and just make sure all the suds are out before letting it air dry. It works wonders and is important to clean to prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this as her birthday present and said that it works seamlessly to blend her makeup!  So I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my beautyblender</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical ordering this since it was cheaper than if I bought it in a store. It arrived promptly and it is the real thing. it looks small but wen you apply water as ou are supposed to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use. Wonderful product and authentic. It works perfectly for a flawless foundation look even over acne.</li>
            <li> I have been debating the purchase of a Beauty Blender for awhile. I couldn&#x27;t get over the price tag initially. I mean who wants to spend $20 on a makeup sponge? I finally took the plunge and purchases this BeautyBlender Pure. Two days later I received my package (thanks Prime!) I tore the package open like a wild animal and opened up my BeautyBlender instantly. I had watched several Youtube videos explaining how to use the BeautyBlender effectively. I ran it under cold water and squeezed out the excess and then pressed it in a towel to soak up all the extra water. I placed a &amp;#34;gob&amp;#34; of foundation on the back of my hand and patted the BeautyBlender in the foundation. I then patted the beautyblender all over my face. NOTE: Don&#x27;t rub your foundation around! I also should mention that I used Revlon ColorStay 24 hour foundation. After I finished application I fell in love! Sure its not magical...and It&#x27;s not a cure all for uneven skin BUT it applies the foundation evenly! I no longer have those awful foundation lines near my hairline. It is a game changer for me! Before purchasing the BeautyBlender I was using cheap wedge sponges that tended to leave little sponge pieces all over my face.</li>
            <li> my beautyblender arrived beyond on time (scheduled delivery was august 13-31, it arrived july 28) and it works flawlessly! i was skeptical about this being the real deal, being a bit less expensive than usual, but it&#x27;s definitely legit.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried other beauty sponges before thinking that they&#x27;re all the same, but after finding a beautyblender for a little cheaper than usual, i thought i&#x27;d give it a shot. i&#x27;m in love! it applies my makeup so flawless and even. i can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to get one!</li>
            <li> Good makeup tool, does get dirty easily though. Washes out with soap!</li>
            <li> This was such a great purchase, I&#x27;m only disappointed I didn&#x27;t start buying these puppies earlier. The beautyblender has the most flawless foundation application I&#x27;ve EVER seen--and I&#x27;ve used brushes from a plethora of top tier brands. I&#x27;ve used a non-brand beauty sponge before but didn&#x27;t get nearly the amazing coverage this one does. It&#x27;s honestly a remarkable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the pure version so I wouldn&#x27;t be dealing with dyes--so far, my sensitive skin has not had any reactions...in fact, I would say its cleared up a bit because the sponge is so easy to clean out every couple of days. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally sold!</li>
            <li> Love my beauty blender! Received  it right on time:-)</li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly. It is so soft and make up becomes so blendable when using this product.  It also washes clean very easily by hand. My daughter loves it and has a pink and a white one.  They have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a great sponge, and I like the way it applies my liquid makeup. My 2 issues with it: (1) I used to use my fingertips, and I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much makeup as I do now. Even after wetting the sponge, this still seems to soak up some makeup -- therefore wasting money. (2) It ripped when I washed it, a few weeks into using it. I ordered another one, and I will try to be more gentle with it. As long as you&#x27;re careful and make sure to avoid any fingernail contact when you&#x27;re washing it, it should be fine.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It works great and has very easy clean up. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I had the purple one and it&#x27;s all soft and stuff. But this one is really hard and it absorb way more product so I&#x27;m not sure if this is real I mean the box if prerry easy to open and there&#x27;s no seal around it so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they put a cheap sponge inside. Just go to the local saphora and buy one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess, but more than likely I will not be repurchasing it because I still find myself reaching for my brush when using this.</li>
            <li> Was excited when I received the Beauty Blender sponge.  It&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this sponge and any other one when you dab or pat instead of using more of a wiping motion.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Works as well as everyone says it does! Flawless application!</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER!!!! I will never go without one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, I love the white since I heard the pink color bleeds when cleaning the original, and blends everything perfectly!</li>
            <li> Edit: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BUY FROM A TRUSTED SELLER! A lot of the 1 star reviews are from people who received dupes or counterfeits from amazon sellers. I&#x27;ve had counterfeit items sold to me and even FULFILLED BY AMAZON in the past so I was especially careful to find one from a seller with 100% feedback - Lock &amp; Mane sells real beauty blenders. (If you order from amazon directly, not just fulfilled by amazon, you will also find a real one) I can&#x27;t imagine anyone comparing this to a store bought sponge, the actual authentic beauty blender is a huge step up it&#x27;s not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS MORE STARS. I just finished my first application with this beauty blender and I was SO blown away that I went straight here to write this review. I bought both a flat Kabuki brush from beauty junkees and this sponge. Prior to this I was using a regular store bought make up sponge which I assumed the beauty blender would be a slightly better version of, holy crap was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flat kabuki brush was the first thing I tried, and it buffed my make up out easily and left a heavy coverage that looked better than it would have if I&#x27;d have attempted it with a generic make up sponge and with less product waste. Unfortunately if you got within 2-3 feet of my face, I looked like a hot mess. The make up was very obvious and made my face look really gross. At this point I really thought it was impossible to wear foundation and have it look like you weren&#x27;t caked in make up and I got really discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried the beauty blender. I was just planning on covering only a few problem areas after the make up mess the kabuki left, but as soon as I started to dab it on my skin and saw how different it looked, I kept going. When I was done I looked in the mirror and I was really impressed, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got really close up that I noticed how AMAZING it looked even from a shorter distance. If you get close enough you can still tell you&#x27;re wearing make up, especially around the dry spots of my face, (I mean dry flaky skin, not just dry areas) but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better. It doesn&#x27;t looked caked on by any means, and it has a much more skin like texture. I feel so gorgeous in my foundation for the first time EVER. I have never gotten my foundation to look this natural or this flattering, just when I was about to give up foundation for good. (ahah well except for bad break outs) AND THE BEST PART which I almost forgot about, is that I used maybe 1/2 to 2/3rds of the foundation I used to. I even had some left over on my hand because I assumed it would take more! This sponge is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kabuki brush is still a good product if you need heavy coverage to hide a lot of pimples or redness, but if you don&#x27;t need a lot of make up and you want a more natural looking foundation, the beauty blender is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever tried. I seriously cannot recommend it enough, I&#x27;ve never been more impressed by a product.y around the dry spots of my face, (I mean dry flaky skin, not just dry areas) but unlike the Kabuki brush it looks way, way better.

            <li> have every type of sponge and foundation brush they make: high end to low end. I had heard about the beauty blender, but thought it was just another sponge. After reading the reviews I decided to try it.  I honestly can not believe I waited so long to purchase it. I was stunned at the results, I did half of my face with the beauty blender and the other half with a high end brush. The beauty blender side was flawless. I have cleaned all my brushes  put them in a bag under my sink!  A brush will never touch my face again.  So easy to use. Just make sure you run it under cool water after use!  Love Love this product. Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Beauty Blender because I was a few bucks short of my free super-saving shipping on an order and had heard good things about it. This thing gives an amazing finish when used with my foundation ( light coverage, Prescriptives Virtual Skin) and is worth every penny. It performs far better than my high quality foundation brush or my fairly cheap Ulta sponges. I have gone from good- looking skin to almost flawless. The difference is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I got the white &amp;#34; pure&amp;#34; one because I read it was best for sensitive skin and did not have the color transfer issues I&#x27;d read  about with the pink one. I contacted the company and was told they are the same and the pure can be used for skin treatment products or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants to make the most of their makeup and get a poreless look.</li>
            <li> I first owned and used the original pink beauty blender and loved it, but my skin didn&#x27;t. I believe the dye in the original one broke out my skin. I also noticed every time I cleaned the pink one it leaked the pink color. So I decided to try the Pure version since I loved the sponge so much. And I am so glad I got it! It does a great job, same quality as the original. Delivers a flawless application of my foundation and I love that this cleans up great! I clean mine periodically with my all natural Castile soap (dr bronners) and all the stains disappear! Amazing sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- January 27th 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 3 months in and this is still my go to tool for applying my foundation and concealer. It is amazing! I have tried it with powder foundations, liquid and cream (my preferred one) and it does a fantastic job on all of them! This is a fantastic tool for people who have sensitive skin, acne prone, etc. Using brushes can be more harsh on the skin, more pulling and tugging, hold bacteria, etc. None of that at all with the beauty blender! Mine is stain free also still and I use it a lot! I thought I would offer some helpful tips for anyone who needs it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t clean it immediately after applying your makeup. Clean it after it has dried, like the next morning or at bed time. I have cleaned mine this way from the get go and never have had any staining with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Clean it with a liquid soap or dish soap. I prefer to use a more natural soap (dr bronners liquid Castile soap) but have heard of success using Dawn dish soap too. These will do a better job of getting the stains out verses using your cleanser and are much cheaper than splurging on the beauty blender one! I clean mine every other use. I see some reviews stating they only cleaned theirs once per month or so. That&#x27;s not smart and slightly annoying that they would write a negative review of this product when it was most likely their own negligence that caused the issues. #1 it&#x27;s white (hello!) #2. Not washing it will cause it to hold bacteria and could cause irritation or break outs. #3. It can also cause the color of the makeup your applying to be off (if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up). Also I see negative written reviews of people who claim their beauty blender grew mold. Folks, DO NOT store it in a closed container while wet! Thought that was a given, apparently not for everyone. Allow it to dry, and then put the lid on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it. Mine has not been broken or fallen apart, but I take my time cleaning it. Wet it, add a few drops of soap, gently massage it in, rinse and repeat if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same). They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it! There is definitely a technique, so educate yourself on how to properly use it. The payoff is worth it! I get a flawless application of my foundation every time. Then flip it to the pointed end and use it for my under eye concealer. Blends beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have for now, I will update again in the future! Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!1 it&#x27;s white (hello!) #2. Not washing it will cause it to hold bacteria and could cause irritation or break outs. #3. It can also cause the color of the makeup your applying to be off (if its hoarding weeks worth of old make up). Also I see negative written reviews of people who claim their beauty blender grew mold.

Be gentle when cleaning this tool, no need to scrub the heck out of it. Mine has not been broken or fallen apart, but I take my time cleaning it. Wet it, add a few drops of soap, gently massage it in, rinse and repeat if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I highly recommend watching some you tube videos on how to use a beauty blender ( more available on the pink one, doesn&#x27;t matter the technique is the same). They were very helpful to me in understanding how to use it! There is definitely a technique, so educate yourself on how to properly use it. The payoff is worth it! I get a flawless application of my foundation every time. Then flip it to the pointed end and use it for my under eye concealer. Blends beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have for now, I will update again in the future! Totally worth the $15 I paid for it!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my life a lot easier :)</li>
            <li> Okay so I ordered this item thinking it was the kit as the posting states: This kit includes: 1 beautyblender® pure sponge, 1 solid cleanser, 1.0 oz., and 1 white organza bag. To my dismay, when I received the item there was only the sponge inside. I am sure the sponge performs great- but I did not want to use it as the other items were not included. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> The PURE blender is amazing! I get a flawless finish every time, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it with BB cream.</li>
            <li> Perfection. I love how soft this is and the finish it creates is beautiful! Love the Pure better than the Pro that I recently purchased.</li>
            <li> What did I ever do without my beauty blender?  Best way to blend foundation and concealer, ever.</li>
            <li> I paid 15.00 for this. I believe the beauty blender is worth 15.00. After using it the first time, I noticed it does give a nice airbrush like finish. Expect to use a little more makeup than you usually do because the sponge does soak it up pretty well, but its worth it, because the end result gives you a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this beautyblender! I use it every day - it&#x27;s more porous than alternative sponges and allows for more even coverage.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. My first one lasted over a year and probably would have lasted longer had it not dropped in the bathroom trash can and I had no choice but to leave it there (germs.) It applies foundation flawlessly. I use BB cream only and it&#x27;s just not the same using my fingers. I even paid extra for one day delivery because I am impatient to get this. It&#x27;s cheaper on here..</li>
            <li> not sure why i waited so long to purchase this sponge.  i love it and it&#x27;s so easy to blend my makeup.  i&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin and i haven&#x27;t changed anything!  highly recommend.  i wash mine after each use - i just use a bar soap (like ivory) and it cleanses the sponge nicely.  i purchased the white one so it is stained from the makeup.</li>
            <li> Awesome beautyblender.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is as good as the hype says it is! Super easy to keep clean and blends everything to perfection!</li>
            <li> it was here on time and I love how it applies my foundation, I would definately recommend this for makeup users</li>
            <li> Blends amzingly! I dont know what I would do without it</li>
            <li> I love using this for blending my concealer. So smooth and no spotty makeup patches</li>
            <li> I love this so much!  I don&#x27;t understand how I went without it.  It blends makeup beautifully!  It&#x27;s soft and of good quality.  I did buy the white which is already discolored from my makeup even though I rinse it after every use however it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the purpose of the product.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT is not enough! Wish it would have specified the size! it&#x27;s a really small sponge</li>
            <li> I love this! I won&#x27;t be going back to another foundation applicator. I would just make sure you clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because the product does work. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with applying makeup. However, I don&#x27;t like that I spent nearly 20$ on it. I bought this in comparison to the cheaper version (4 pack monster blender one) and it does the exact same thing as this \\&quot;just 1\\&quot; sponge. Still impressive but your paying for the brand. Cheaper versions at least in my opinion do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my pink beauty blenders bleed. I love beauty blenders, they make your makeup look absolutely flawless!</li>
            <li> I used the BB ONE TIME and it started to fall apart. It is ripping from the bottom where I washed the makeup off. Very frustrating and annoyed that it isn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves this. Was alright. No different from the cheap wedge though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to write this review... I just received the \\&quot;Beauty Blender\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m a bit concerned that it came in a plastic bag and not official BB packaging. It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but that has nothing to do with performance. I have no idea if this is a legit product or not, but I&#x27;ll update my review once I&#x27;ve actually used it. I&#x27;m going to spend more $ in the meantime and order a blender directly from beauty blender and compare the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 01/01/15: after buying a true beauty blender I can say this one is not the real deal.  The one I purchased from this seller absorbs way too much product, and is 2-3 times larger than a true beauty blender.  The \\&quot;real\\&quot; beauty blender applies my foundation flawlessly, this one just absorbs my foundation any barely deposits any on my face.  This is unfortunate that there appear to be so many fake products being sold through Amazon as it&#x27;s such a convenient way to order.</li>
            <li> I looooove the pure BB! It didnt bleed any color when you rinsed it like the pink one does. I am a BB fan and I swear by BB!</li>
            <li> beauty blenders have changed my life for the better. The white one is so pretty (only when it&#x27;s clean lol). Otherwise, its kind of gross. lol But i like that there is no dye and that its so neutral and pure looking (again when clean... lol)</li>
            <li> I use this guy everymorning for my foundation and I love it. At first I also used it for my blush and powder but in the end I like brushes better for those. My foundation goes on more evenly and stays on throughout the day better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be &#x27;groundbreaking&#x27; like a lot of people say. It does help, like any sponge would, but I find my airbrush concealer brush to work much better for contouring my face and blending in colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s white, the stains from the concealer and foundation make it look dirty, even after washing. If anyone knows how to remove please tell me, hehe.</li>
            <li> I really like the BeautyBlender make up sponge; the resulting makeup finish is very nice, but not quite as spectacular as reviews claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the FINISHED LOOK: I was hoping for the air-brushed poreless finish that others have promised, however, it does NOT deliver that.  It does, however, offer a smooth, even application that is somewhat akin to, but  ever so slightly better that, a very careful fingertip application.  Using this sponge (at the pointy end, for crevices) does have benefit of being more gentle on the eye area (where one should avoid tugging, etc).  I DO find this highly superior to using a brush or &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; make up sponge, but not significantly better than a good fingertip application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I REALLY LOVED it for: Powers.  While it less than impressed me with liquids, I was surprised to find that I truly loved it for applying powers and blushes.  Good blending and non-caking finish.  Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from it&#x27;s good-but-less-than-promised results there are three NEGATIVES to note:&lt;br /&gt;1:  Cleaning Issue #1. (Easily fixed.)  Don&#x27;t order the white one.  Just don&#x27;t.  Get the pink.  It&#x27;s very hard to get the white one completely clean&lt;br /&gt;2.  Cleaning Issue #2.  Takes forever to rinse out.  Keeping it clean and bacteria free is important, so you will clean it after each use.  Which take several minutes.  Any time you save by using this will be more than used up by the minutes (plural!) you spend cleaning your sponge.  3-5 minutes a day on &amp;#34;sponge care&amp;#34; is 2.5 to 4.5 minutes too many.  Cleaners need to work better.&lt;br /&gt;3. Makeup hog.  I find I use 30-50% more foundation than when using my fingers.  It does soak up more than a bit of product.</li>
            <li> I have used all the imitation beauty blenders and even though they were great, they don&#x27;t compare to the real thing.  I love the way this sponge applies my liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: wet the sponge, squeeze out excess water and squeeze in a clean towel before using each time.  When slightly damp, they work better and absorb less of your makeup.</li>
            <li> I thought this sponge sucked!! I could have gone to Target or Walmart and bought a bunch of sponges for that prize! its the same quality! ripped the first week I used it! Maybe I should have bought the PINK 1?! Cause this sucked!! What a RIP off!! I want my money back!!🙅😠👎👎</li>
            <li> I like this sponge because it is as I expected. It has very small pores which sets it apart from many other sponges. Even though the pores are small, it also doesn&#x27;t smudge like some sponges do that have closed pores which actually just move the product around on the skin. The shape is especially nice because you can fit in tight spaces on the face. It is costly as sponges go, but worth the price. I notice many professional make up artists use them which is a good visual recommendation.</li>
            <li> The white color is not worth paying more, but this product is wonderful for putting on foundation. Tried to buy knock offs and they are horrible.  Will only purchase Beauty Blender from now on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing all of the great reviews and because using my fingers just wasn&#x27;t working.  My foundation dries very quickly and is hard to work with.  This blender is working great (after i got used to it!).&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is already loosing it&#x27;s suedelike texture by getting small holes all around it.  It&#x27;s just not going to last and for this amount of money one would expect it to last  through more than maybe 15 uses, washing it gently.&lt;br /&gt;So, would I order again?  Not unless it was at least half this price.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has replaced all of my foundation and stippling brushes. I&#x27;m obsessed with the flawless look it gives me... no streaks, no weird blending issues, just perfect airbrushed skin. It lasted me about six weeks, and I thoroughly washed it about twice a week. Definitely worth it if you&#x27;re serious about makeup!</li>
            <li> Over rated product. Absolutely nothing special. Sigma brush is much better imo.</li>
            <li> Too much money for a &#x27;sponge&#x27;</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this, but I have to say IT REALLY IS FANTASTIC! it applied and blended my foundation beautifully. TOTALLY Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will defiantly buy another one when mine runs down. Get the pro beauty blender in soon! And maybe a nice Christmas sale!</li>
            <li> Very soft but too small</li>
            <li> I love this, it really can make your store brand makeup look a lot nicer if you aply it correctly with this little guy!</li>
            <li> Not super impressed.  Covers just as well as foundation  being applied with the sponge  it came with.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the type</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to drop almost $20 on a makeup sponge but I am doing makeup for a friends&#x27; wedding here soon and I&#x27;d heard great things about this little number. So I sported for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really DOES do an amazing job of applying foundation. Your skin looks airbrushed...really flawless. Make sure you use it as directed...wet first, towel dry, then apply the foundation in a stippling (bouncing) manner. Those who are unimpressed, I&#x27;m guessing, are not using it the right way. In my experience there is absolutely no comparison between this sponge and a cheap sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold the color so if you&#x27;re skitchy about that, well, maybe go with a purple or pink one.</li>
            <li> Was contemplating whether or not to buy the $2 versions of this but I bought this one instead and don&#x27;t regret it at all. This works so well and blends perfectly. The price is reasonable for the amount of work this little thing does</li>
            <li> I did not rate this five stars only because it is difficult to clean.  I love the way it works though.</li>
            <li> I used a &#x27;dupe&#x27; for a while but could not figure out what the big deal was. It was hard to use, stiff, and I ended up throwing it out. I finally caved and ordered this, and it is totally different. It&#x27;s really very good. Don&#x27;t forget to dampen in, otherwise it just won&#x27;t do anything at all. I love how easy it is to squish so you can make it small for every curve and cranny on your face---under eyes, on lids, by the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a very light and airbrushed effect, which is lovely. Never looks like a mask, but you easily get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that it is impossible to not get it stained, that it has to be washed after every single use, and that it forces you to use more product than if you were just using your fingers. It&#x27;s still the best makeup applicator I have ever used. I&#x27;ve gotten rid of others over the years and always gone back to my using my fingers, but this thing is for keeps.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to use at first but went on Utube and saw tutorials on it.  You MUST get it wet and then squeeez out excess H2o.  Easy to clean, just soap and water and it looks new again.  My foundation looks great and no streaks!!!</li>
            <li> - I never used a beauty blender before but when I purchased this, I was very shocked with the results! I compared this to my kabuki brush and my brush had no chance of winning! I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Kinda pissed that it&#x27;s not as big as pictured. Even when wet, it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> How come I didn&#x27;t hear about this sponge earlier?! I love it, and use it everyday. My makeup looks more natural, def going to keep purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in like with my beauty blender.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and gives a nice finish.  Perhaps after the glowing reviews I was expecting miracles and I&#x27;m still just the same old me.  I&#x27;m glad to have it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail for it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this little egg shaped sponge... I couldn&#x27;t see how it would make my makeup application any better, or easier. Little did I know... I use this to put on a cream powder foundation, and also concealer, and it leaves a smooth, amazing finish! It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to handle, and works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders. Great buy</li>
            <li> This is a perfect foundation applicator!</li>
            <li> I really love these sponges and I can&#x27;t do my makeup without them anymore. It&#x27;s almost 3in big when wet.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend getting a Beauty Blender if you&#x27;re looking for a way to apply make-up flawlessly. One thing that I noticed people were forgetting to do is make sure that the sponge is wet before you use it. That&#x27;s what I like about the Beauty Blender. Becasue it has to be wet, you use less product, which saves you money in the end. I will say that this white Beauty Blender is a bit difficult to clean, but it still works the same as the pink one. I think these blenders are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was  debating if I should by this because they are expensive.  I bought one form foundation and one for blush. Well worth it.  My make up looks so much better because of this.</li>
            <li> Awesome and smooth. I even use one to put on my moisturizer. Better than other makeup sponges. I will only be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a real beauty blender, the texture was weird and it started tearing after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Its the real beauty blender</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two months now and I use it every time I apply foundation (I use a cream formula).  It gives me an incredibly smooth and natural-looking application.  Using the beautyblender, my makeup goes farther and looks better.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all, unlike makeup brushes.  I immediately clean my beautyblender after I&#x27;ve finished using it every time and have never had any problems with my makeup becoming discolored or not applying evenly, and the product hasn&#x27;t caused skin irritation as a result.  Some reviewers noted having these problems, but they may be caused by not cleaning the product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miscellaneous note: I use highly-pigmented foundation and there has been some discoloration of my beautyblender (to the color of my foundation), but in my case the discoloration doesn&#x27;t indicate makeup build-up.  If your product becomes slightly discolored even with regular cleansing, it still shouldn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
            <li> It does leave my makeup with a great texture, so that&#x27;s a huge pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, within the first week it started to fall apart (rips, chunks falling out, etc)... In order to try and avoid having it fall apart completely, I can&#x27;t wash it very thoroughly so it&#x27;s no longer white but skin-toned.  This is slowing down the breakdown, but having only had it for maybe 3 or 4 weeks, I&#x27;m concerned that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last another 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original pink BeautyBlender, but the white option just appealed to me more (less scary pink dye maybe?). It&#x27;s awesome for applying liquid foundation, blending concealer highlighter, blush...really any makeup product. It really does give an airbrushed-looking finish, at least with the foundation I use (Revlon Colorstay Whipped). I&#x27;m so glad I read the instructions though -- I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s supposed to be used damp! I skipped the expensive BeautyBlender cleaner and instead dab/rub it on a bar of soap, rinsing several times to get all the product off. Works like a charm and is much cheaper. When used correctly, the BeautyBlender is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the beauty blender product for quite a while now. I usually get it from sephora, but I thought I would order this dye free one. It is terrible. I am not sure if its because it is not the real thing, or because it is made differently than the pink one, but it does not apply makeup the same. The texture is entirely different from the pink beauty blender. It feels like cheap foam. The beauty blender is soft and applies makeup evenly. This does not as it is very porous and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on asking a few makeup artist friends of mine if this is just how the dye free one is, or if I received a knockoff, and updating my review.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee, loooooove, loooooove nice, light weight, and easy to use and clean. i am looking forward to buying the cleaner</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beauty blender\\&quot; seemed like any other sponge to me... I&#x27;m a little disappointed I paid so much for it. The finish it gives you and its blending ability is much the same as any other sponge, so I wont be investing in this product again. For one tenth of the price I can get a packet of regular sponges that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> So i ordered this two days ago shipping was great. When i picked up the item the seal was broken i was like no big deal but when i looked at the sponge their was make up on it. 15 dollars is a lot of money for used crap so pissed</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s blend very well</li>
            <li> I love mine! Although white is not the best color choice..</li>
            <li> i get my 2 blender damaged</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with all beauty blenders</li>
            <li> My foundation application was flawless! I didn&#x27;t want to believe the hype but this product is truly amazing. I would definitely recommend. Giving it four stars because I think $15 for a sponge is a bit excessive. :/</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers indicated that it may be a fake.  Whether it is or not, it works great for me, and the price is reasonable.  I much prefer applying foundation, blush, concealer, etc. with this instead of my fingers.</li>
            <li> Most people would think like i did that its just a makeup sponge... but OMG it was way more, i don&#x27;t know what they do to make it different i&#x27;m just happy that its here for me to use!! WOW, again a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Love Beautyblender sponges. I have never found anything that gives me such a smooth and even foundation application. I find the Pure Beautybenders to be far better than the original pink ones. They smell better, are easier to clean (i.e. more product comes out leaving them less stained), and last longer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVVVVEEEE the beauty blender!!!! It makes my foundation look sooo good and my application: FLAWLESSS and NATURAL! I am so happy about this purchase! I will definitely be buying more of these!!! Oh and they are softer than a babies bum too!!!!! I am in love with this thing!!!!</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER! I will NEVER use another makeup brush again to put on my foundation, concealer etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using a brush for foundation for a number of years.  Then I came across a foundation that I really wanted to like, but it wasn&#x27;t applying very well on my face.  I read a review that this particular foundation worked best with a beautyblender.  So, I bought one, and I haven&#x27;t looked back twice.  I do keep mine clean with beautyblender cleanser, which works just fine to get it back to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; white.  My foundation goes on thick and smooth - basically flawless.  You can&#x27;t beat the coverage compared to a brush.  And keep in mind, some foundations just may work better with one over the other.  I use this with my favorite foundation, and as long as I&#x27;m using it, I will continue to use this beautyblender.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on this product, I decided to give it a shot... I&#x27;m glad that I did. Applies make up evenly and in easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be disappointing after all of the hype, but I was not one bit let down. I chose the pure because I heard the pink one can stain counters or other surfaces it is left out on. I have used it for approximately 4 months and it is still holding up nicely. It makes blending much more easy and I like that I can adjust the amount of moisture in the blender to thin out thicker foundations. I have let a couple of family members try this and they both ordered their own immediately after.  The only cons are the price, and that you need to leave it out in the air to dry to avoid mold.</li>
            <li> Fake. Get it from Sephora.</li>
            <li> A great buy, a great product!</li>
            <li> Makes my make up very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is evenly blended and my skin looks very velvety and silky ❤️ But you have to use it the right way to get the best results</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC! I have tried the knock off brands, and they are not the same. This sponge applies your liquid makeup flawlessly and easily. It lasts me about a year before needing to be replaced. I do clean it with my brush cleaner and/or baby soap regularly. This will change how to apply your foundation!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is as good as they say!! I&#x27;m so happy I finally bit the bullet and purchased this. I always have trouble with my foundation looking a little cakey (I have a lot of acne scars left from a mildly severe cystic acne breakout) so I always wear full coveraged foundations. The thing is that sometimes when I apply the foundation with my hands, I can still little dry flakes peeking through. I haven&#x27;t had this problem since using the beauty blender and my foundation never looks cakey anymore!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hate is that it stains but it&#x27;s white so I&#x27;ll let it slide.  Bottom line, YOU NEED THIS.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will never use a brush to apply foundation again.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says</li>
            <li> Love it!! Makes makeup application seamless.</li>
            <li> The one that I received was not an authentic beautyblender sponge. It was a dupe. After having bought the real beautyblender multiple times from a different retailer, I was able to spot that this was a fake before I even opened the package. The shape is similar but a bit off. It is not the normal egg shape. The knockoff I received was more elongated and had a more sharply pointed tip. It also doesn&#x27;t expand as much when wet as the authentic sponge. If I had wanted a dupe, I would have bought a cheap dupe. Multiple vendors sell the beautyblender on this site, and the one that I bought it from was Rea.deeming Beauty, Inc.  I definitely learned my lesson to not buy a beautyblender unless I know it came directly from the manufacturer to the retail location that I&#x27;m purchasing from.  I would rather pay the extra money if I know for a fact that the one I&#x27;m getting is real and worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Blends my foundation beautifully, but it started cracking after the first use.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blender it&#x27;s perfect for applying foundation , bb cream , and even concealer .. I&#x27;m in love with it&lt;br /&gt;and it came with a soap for cleaning it .. totally awesome</li>
            <li> Seriously. Get one and I PROMISE you won&#x27;t regret your choice. The beauty blender has truly replaced all brushes and applicators for makeup and I am SOOOOO mad that I did not buy one sooner! I use this every morning for highlighting, contouring, blending, and concealing. The shape gets into every nook and cranny of your face easily. Even though I bought the white \\&quot;pure\\&quot; blender, the stains are completely removed after a single wash. I look airbrushed after using this and my skin looks so naturally healthy! I seriously haven&#x27;t touched any of my brushes after buying this product (though I suggest looking around for comparable products at reduced prices because this is rather pricey if you are on a tight budget). Overall, though, I&#x27;m googly-eyed in LOVE.</li>
            <li> Works so well highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waste this money on a sponge? Honestly my hand can produce similar but better application. I will not return it, but I am definitely not impressed with it. Maybe I am not using it correctly? I will play with it more, I only had it for a month.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally got my hands on one of these beauties! A+ all around! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is my favorite tool to apply foundation and the white one doesn&#x27;t bleed the pink color like the pink one does!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it would wash cleaner and was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pay $30+ on a cosmetic sponge, but when I saw the Beauty Blender PURE on Amazon for about half the price, I purchased...if I didn&#x27;t like it, it was only a small loss. I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while now, and use this every single day. It is heaven and totally worth every penny. Taken care of appropriately, the Beauty Blender will last you a long time and keep you looking flawless. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Works like a dream, I just wish I would&#x27;ve got the set with thw cleaner.</li>
            <li> I resisted. I mean its a beauty sponge right? No. This is not. This is something much more than that. My skin/face/makeup looks flawless! I&#x27;m amazed. I want 10 more and I want to give one to every woman I know!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve used regular makeup sponges, but this really blends nicely.  And, for someone who doesn&#x27;t care much for make-up, I was truly impressed.</li>
            <li> i love it really good, product i woo repurchase it again if i needed to. great quality. easy to use</li>
            <li> This SPONGE did not work any better than the cheap wedges one can buy.  This product certainly doesn&#x27;t justify the high cost! Upset I even paid this much especially when the results were no different than any other sponge.  Save your money, you can blend better with your fingers!</li>
            <li> I have waited years to get this product. After seeing a lot of make up artists that I follow use this product and having a gift card I decided to make the splurge on the expensive sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was disappointed to find that after weeks of use the only thing the sponge does with my mac  prolong wear concealer under my eyes is take off a layer of foundation and make my cheeks rosy red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure if my skin is sensitive to it although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that ...I think the sponge is absorbing my concealer and foundation as I&#x27;m trying to blend out the concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not a newbie to make up and I consider myself an intermediate make it person. I have used this sponge lightly damp as suggested by many people. I have also tried this dry. I get pretty much the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really want to like this product because it&#x27;s used by so many people but I think I will just stick to my concealer brush that works really well.</li>
            <li> I must have been possessed by a thrifty beauty guru of days long past when I purchased this. I wanted, nay good sir, NEEDED a BeautyBlender, to see the magical majesty it would take my daily makeup routine to. But $20 was still steep for 1 sponge/unicorn egg thing. So I found the cheapest one. The BeautyBlender &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; In white. Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; part phase you, it is not a more ecofriendly version, nor does it come in ecofriendly packaging. The Pure is reference to the purity of a white product and the absence of dyes I guess. There is no real information as to why this one is marketed as &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34;. But it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the white sponge to apply highly pigmented goo to my face. with a porous sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a smart woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn dish soap couldn&#x27;t get the stains of foundation and concealer out of this thing. Purity Gel Cleanser by Philosophy, MAC Brush Cleaner, Baby Shampoo, Olive Oil, Shea Moisture Bar Soap (the black one) mismatched combinations of all of the above in blistering hot water, repeatedly. Until the day I trashed it it was still stained. I did not want to buy the BeautyBlender Cleanser (liquid or solid) when I have used any of the above mentioned to clean a variety of brushes to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it was stunning at blending in my concealer and foundation. excellent if I got a wee bit heavy handed with the concealer and started to look clownish. It applies foundation, concealer, and powders incredibly well. Blends out contours, highlight, foundations, concealers, correctors, and blush like there are a billion teeny makeup artists on the surface of this sponge working in unison. I loved what it did for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy the white one if you have a neurotic tick about things being clean and/or not stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. Don&#x27;t bleach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.p.s. I am replacing with a Royal Purple one and i will post how that goes after some testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.p.p.s. Seriously. No. Bleach. Do not be tempted. Unless you have an old one that is being trashed anyways, then go ahead. Prepare to be amazed.Seriously. No. Bleach. Do not be tempted.
