            <li>This came super quick and exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>All images are etched deep enough that even the really intricate ones come out great.</li>
            <li>And without all the images, what is there is scaled too large to reasonably fit anyone&#x27;s nail unless it is a giant nail bed.</li>

            <li>Use old gift card.</li>
            <li>But kind of hard to use !! „Ö†„Ö†</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the metal edged scraper, I throw those away and use an old credit card instead.</li>

            <li> It came on time, some of the images dont stamp well most if them do!</li>
            <li> great, I loved the designs on it but I knew I would like it cause I did my research.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Cici&amp;Sisi sets so far, I&#x27;m only lacking one! This set has very unique and well-etched images. The stamper works well without any priming. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the metal edged scraper, I throw those away and use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> I like the plate but they are too big for my nail bed.  I suggest you measure your nail bed before you purchase any stamp plates.</li>
            <li> I am new to the nail art world. These plates and stamper are excellent . The case the stamps come in are wonderful. Don&#x27;t use scraper, it will scratch your plates. Use old gift card.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get the hang of wiping off the excess, and quickly getting the ink in the stamp,  but after that I got good results. Use a flat surface when wiping the plates! I don&#x27;t like all of the designs...</li>
            <li> I love love my cici&amp;sisi nail plates.</li>

            <li> Amazing thanks i love me new plagues thanksss</li>
            <li> I have hundreds of stamping plates that I use daily on my clients. These plates (this brand) are the best by far. Every image stamps out every time. I haven&#x27;t found a dud yet. All images are etched deep enough that even the really intricate ones come out great. I use a marshmallow (XL round white super squishy Like the one from Winstonia) stamper and have never been disappointed with these plates.</li>
            <li> love the plates but the plastic sleeve protectors were ripped at the seems on some of them.</li>
            <li> Is not what I was looking for the stamps are to big for my nails</li>
            <li> Love!!  Cici&amp;Sisi never disappoints üòçüòç</li>
            <li> While I love the majority of the designs on these plates, some of them do not have the full designs as shown in the pictures. The big block of characters at the tops of three of the plates are missing some images like they were not machined the same. And without all the images, what is there is scaled too large to reasonably fit anyone&#x27;s nail unless it is a giant nail bed. A bit disappointing as some of the images missing are the ones I was really looking forward to using.</li>
            <li> great designs on the plates. can surely have fun with this.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. She used couple other brands before, but this one is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li> Great plates, love them. Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
