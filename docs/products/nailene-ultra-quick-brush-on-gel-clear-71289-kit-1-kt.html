    <ol>

            <li>you would be better off going to the Dollar Store and spending 99cents !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Love these nails!!</li>
            <li>Like with most things, practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li>Very easy if you read all the DIRECTIONS before you start!</li>
            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;ultra Quick&amp;#34; is a joke, and not in a good way...</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>You can get nice look and neat nails.</li>
            <li>it makes your nails nice and shiny</li>
            <li>I have also done my own acrylics at home.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit and works well.  </li>
            <li>The nails are nice.  </li>
            <li>but honestly they feel very secure.</li>
            <li>Bonds better than acrylic.  </li>
            <li>And you will get several great set of nails at a fraction of the cost of a salon!</li>
            <li>I love the look of salon nails</li>
            <li>Cons: you will probably need to purchase more gel for refills.</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t find any better gel kits out ther then</li>
            <li>Yes, but I am sure there are better ones out there</li>
            <li>I have had both acrylics and gel tips done at a salon many times.</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for at about three dollars a pop?</li>
            <li>My nails look pretty awesome for just trying this for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smoothly and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I just tried this product for the first time today, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Pros: easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The process, easy.  </li>
            <li>Here it is on Amazon for $10.95 with Prime free 2-day shipping.  </li>
            <li>the kit was cheap..</li>
            <li>This product was quick, easy after reading the instructions twice.  </li>
            <li>By my third time, they looked perfect with clear polish.</li>
            <li>if there was a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; rating, that would have been far more accurate..</li>
            <li>I mean perfect, far better than a salon.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold the gel overlay in a bigger size or an individual size because I need more and have a good amt of brush cleaner and activator available but</li>
            <li>It dries fast no UV light needed.  </li>
            <li>Not at all worth the time.</li>
            <li>Then I soak them off in acetone and apply fresh.</li>
            <li>and if you are applying french tips then there is no need for a top coat.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice, the first two times I did them I had to wear colored polish.</li>
            <li>The first time, i followed directions to a t....and had some lifting and popping off within a couple days...</li>
            <li>At first it took me over an hour from start to finish..</li>
            <li>Hubby is much happier about the price too!</li>
            <li>This is incredibly easy to apply, has no harsh odor and dries lightning fast.</li>
            <li>The nails look far more natural, are nearly as strong and actually last much longer.</li>
            <li>I found that this product works really well</li>
            <li>the whole kit</li>
            <li>so much for brushing on....</li>
            <li>I love the nail tips, very natural and not too long.</li>
            <li>, I will probably use this with other- hopefully better gel kits I plan to buy  </li>
            <li>The gel does take forever to dry even after using an UV light.  </li>
            <li>I love brush on acrylic because its less work but never again will I buy this brand</li>
            <li>I may have enough left for 1 more application.  </li>
            <li>but, the finished look without the polish looked very natural and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Also, its easy to apply to your real nails and after you apply the activator it dries really quickly, if you put thin coats at a time    </li>
            <li>I just purchased this item, this is my first time using a gel nail at home kit, I would say that the product is decent, better to buy it in a store for 11.00 dollars than pay extra 6.00 dollars for shipping because it is not worth the extra money    </li>
            <li>You will still have more than enough of the other items in the kit.</li>
            <li>After about three weeks I use the \\&quot;brush cleaner\\&quot; to soften the newly grown out ridge near the cuticle, file it just a bit, buff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this same kit in the past and only used the white tips and had great results.</li>
            <li>Kit is hard to work with it much easier to get a gel builder kit and a uv light</li>
            <li>They look extremely natural but wear like salon done gel nails.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and looks professional.  </li>
            <li>:  when using the gel on you real nails only, it does its job, it makes your nails hard-depending on the amount of coats you apply  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t yellow, don&#x27;t break and look amazingly real...</li>
            <li>now, a complete set takes 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails, I don&#x27;t have to buy a UV light and it takes literally minutes to apply and less than 5 minutes to dry hard.</li>
            <li>The application was very simple and virtually mess free.</li>
            <li>, there was no chipping, they appeared to last the 2 full days I had them on, but I accidently got acetone on them and just decided to remove them, so I can&#x27;t say how long they actually last at this point  </li>
            <li>the nail kit was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Also, you only get an extremely small amount of the gel overly, its 5 grams I believe, this is not going to last for more than 2 apllications</li>
            <li>it dried out after the first application!</li>
            <li>Kit only came with natural tips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stay at home mom of four, so i keep busy and use my hands a lot, and they last me 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It came with white french tips and natural nails.</li>
            <li>Do 2 to 3 coats the first time, then one coat every few days to maintain it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> shame it does not last long enough</li>
            <li> The false nails provided were decent but trying to put the gel on top turned out looking a cheap ugly mess  </li>
            <li> They soak off in just a few minutes, far faster than acrylics.</li>
            <li> I used the regular non-French tip nail and painted them pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nail kit and several other brands.</li>
            <li> This system has acrylics beat by a long shot!</li>
            <li> Goes on lumpy and takes FOREVER to dry.  </li>
            <li> However the shipping cost is half the actual cost of the product which maybe a deterent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long they will last</li>
            <li> And the reason it might not of dried for some people is you have to have equal amounts of the gel stuff on your nails,</li>
            <li> , still wet.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe no one else on here has the same complaint???</li>
            <li> I ended up with nothing but a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> but when I received mine, the gel acrylic was spilled inside of the package and what was left of it was very sticky and couldn&#x27;t be used :(</li>
            <li> in the DIRECTIONS it tells you what to do if your nails aren&#x27;t dry in a few minutes!!</li>
            <li> It is as durable as acrylic but doesn&#x27;t have the harsh affect.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money for nothing.</li>
            <li> All in all I say A+ to this product and would recommend this to anyone with at least half a brain...</li>
            <li> I also like the fact they provide you with the brush cleaner to keep the brush from getting hard from the Gel activator</li>
            <li> You put one thin coat of overlay then a thin coat of activator.  </li>
            <li> The gel has an awful loud odor, I mean to the point that I chocked up</li>
            <li> When it got here the glue was already dried out and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Sad to say</li>
            <li> The Bad:  </li>
            <li> the worst product I have EVER purchased...in history.....</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on lumpy and takes FOREVER to dry.  Not at all worth the time.</li>
            <li> dont work, one of  them had no brush, maybe its made like that..i dont know, i know i dont like it</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for $11.99.  Here it is on Amazon for $10.95 with Prime free 2-day shipping.  This is incredibly easy to apply, has no harsh odor and dries lightning fast. They look extremely natural but wear like salon done gel nails.  You put one thin coat of overlay then a thin coat of activator.  Don&#x27;t glob it on and always put the brush into the cleaner between fingers.  Do only one finger at a time after you get the artificials on.  Do 2 to 3 coats the first time, then one coat every few days to maintain it.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  I can do my own nails, I don&#x27;t have to buy a UV light and it takes literally minutes to apply and less than 5 minutes to dry hard.</li>
            <li> This product was quick, easy after reading the instructions twice.  Affordable and looks professional.  I did my nails as well as my cousins. It came with white french tips and natural nails. 2 sets of each.  It dries fast no UV light needed.  It had a brusg cleaner that was the brush does not get destroyed.  Will purchase again.  Maybe online becasue I picked up the last kit at Rite Aid.  I wish they sold the gel overlay in a bigger size or an individual size because I need more and have a good amt of brush cleaner and activator available but the gel overlay is running out.  I used 3 coats on my nails and 2 on my cousins.  I may have enough left for 1 more application.  Feels nature. Bonds better than acrylic.  Although I am still working on my acrylic technique.</li>
            <li> Love these nails!! Very easy if you read all the DIRECTIONS before you start! The bottle that doesn&#x27;t have a brush isn&#x27;t supposed to! Read the directions!!!!! And you will get several great set of nails at a fraction of the cost of a salon! And the reason it might not of dried for some people is you have to have equal amounts of the gel stuff on your nails, in the DIRECTIONS it tells you what to do if your nails aren&#x27;t dry in a few minutes!!</li>
            <li> I found that this product works really well and if you are applying french tips then there is no need for a top coat. It is as durable as acrylic but doesn&#x27;t have the harsh affect. I would definitely buy this product again. However the shipping cost is half the actual cost of the product which maybe a deterent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nail kit and several other brands. I love the look of salon nails but their price doesn&#x27;t agree with this mom&#x27;s pocketbook! You can get nice look and neat nails. Be warned, it takes practice. There are tutorials on how to apply the kit online. Watch them! They will save you time and money. Pros: easy and inexpensive. I love the nail tips, very natural and not too long. Cons: you will probably need to purchase more gel for refills. You will still have more than enough of the other items in the kit. Hint: The \\&quot;gel overlay\\&quot; is actually resin nail glue. So you can purchase nailene&#x27;s brush on nail glue or even another brand. Just search for resin nail glue.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item, this is my first time using a gel nail at home kit, I would say that the product is decent, better to buy it in a store for 11.00 dollars than pay extra 6.00 dollars for shipping because it is not worth the extra money    The Good:  when using the gel on you real nails only, it does its job, it makes your nails hard-depending on the amount of coats you apply  it makes your nails nice and shiny, there was no chipping, they appeared to last the 2 full days I had them on, but I accidently got acetone on them and just decided to remove them, so I can&#x27;t say how long they actually last at this point  I also like the fact they provide you with the brush cleaner to keep the brush from getting hard from the Gel activator, I will probably use this with other- hopefully better gel kits I plan to buy  Also, its easy to apply to your real nails and after you apply the activator it dries really quickly, if you put thin coats at a time    The Bad:  The gel has an awful loud odor, I mean to the point that I chocked up and my eyes started to water and burn, like the reaction you get from peeling an onion.  The false nails provided were decent but trying to put the gel on top turned out looking a cheap ugly mess  Also, you only get an extremely small amount of the gel overly, its 5 grams I believe, this is not going to last for more than 2 apllications IF that for both hands    So would I buy it again- the whole kit No. If I can&#x27;t find any better gel kits out ther then Yes, but I am sure there are better ones out there</li>
            <li> Kit only came with natural tips.  Followed directions after one day one popped off, next day another came off.  I&#x27;ve purchased this same kit in the past and only used the white tips and had great results.</li>
            <li> Kit is hard to work with it much easier to get a gel builder kit and a uv light</li>
            <li> shame it does not last long enough</li>
            <li> I bought this kit at Walmart but it&#x27;s actually cheaper here on Amazon. The kit is enough to do your nails about 4 times. I have had both acrylics and gel tips done at a salon many times. I have also done my own acrylics at home. This system has acrylics beat by a long shot! The nails look far more natural, are nearly as strong and actually last much longer. It takes some practice, the first two times I did them I had to wear colored polish. By my third time, they looked perfect with clear polish. I mean perfect, far better than a salon. They seem to not need fill ins as often as salon acrylics. In fact, I don&#x27;t fill them in at all. After about three weeks I use the \\&quot;brush cleaner\\&quot; to soften the newly grown out ridge near the cuticle, file it just a bit, buff and I can get another two weeks out of them. Then I soak them off in acetone and apply fresh. They soak off in just a few minutes, far faster than acrylics. They don&#x27;t yellow, don&#x27;t break and look amazingly real... what more could you ask for at about three dollars a pop?</li>
            <li> I love this! I paid $6 at Walmart! The first time, i followed directions to a t....and had some lifting and popping off within a couple days...the second time, i found that using naileen nail glue to apply made them last a lot longer. I used all the nails in the package within a couple months, and still had enough gel and activator to use with the white tips i had purchased on ebay for $2. At first it took me over an hour from start to finish..now, a complete set takes 15-20 minutes. Like with most things, practice makes perfect. My friends can&#x27;t even tell i did them at home! I apply 3 coats. I&#x27;m a stay at home mom of four, so i keep busy and use my hands a lot, and they last me 2-3 weeks. Hubby is much happier about the price too! Lol</li>
            <li> it dried out after the first application!</li>
            <li> the nail kit was exactly what I expected.  Probably will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The gel does take forever to dry even after using an UV light.  Plus it does not hold the polish well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit and works well.  I use it to protect my nails when I get a tear.  It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smoothly and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even try to use the product because it was damaged when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product for the first time today, and I love it! My nails look pretty awesome for just trying this for the first time ever. The application was very simple and virtually mess free. I am very happy with how my nails look... I am not sure how long they will last but honestly they feel very secure. I used the regular non-French tip nail and painted them pink but, the finished look without the polish looked very natural and very shiny. All in all I say A+ to this product and would recommend this to anyone with at least half a brain... it was that simple.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! Sad to say but when I received mine, the gel acrylic was spilled inside of the package and what was left of it was very sticky and couldn&#x27;t be used :( I love brush on acrylic because its less work but never again will I buy this brand</li>
            <li> The nails are nice.  The process, easy.  However, it takes FOREVER for the gel coat to harden IF it ever does harden.  I applied just one coat--wet.  Followed instructions and applied another coat--2 hours later, still wet.  I ended up with nothing but a sticky mess.  I can&#x27;t believe no one else on here has the same complaint???</li>
            <li> When it got here the glue was already dried out and impossible to use. Wasted my money for nothing.</li>
            <li> the worst product I have EVER purchased...in history.....the brush on activator has NO brush..so much for brushing on....and &amp;#34;dries in 5 minutes&amp;#34;..2 hrs later and it was still not sealed.......you would be better off going to the Dollar Store and spending 99cents !!!...it&#x27;s not like the kit was cheap..so now I have a box of GARBAGE..!!!  the &amp;#34;ultra Quick&amp;#34; is a joke, and not in a good way...if there was a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; rating, that would have been far more accurate..</li>
