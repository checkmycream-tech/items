            <li>Really love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Received it a day earlier than it said, which was wonderful because I was almost out!</li>
            <li>Love this product and it was such a great deal!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The hair will move.&lt;br /&gt;I found there isn&#x27;t any strong odor to this spray; it is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this hairspray holds my curl all day.</li>
            <li>As expected, a great product.</li>
            <li>Great to do business with always get my package within few days.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair spray, phenomenal hold for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray and it got here very fast.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but this is the second time I didn&#x27;t get my order in two days.</li>

            <li>It works really well with my Spice Cream &amp; sister Freeze Wax .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that won&#x27;t hold curl for anything, and this hairspray helps exponentially.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li>A+, highly recommended, prompt service, high quality product</li>
            <li>Love the product it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or heavy but holds</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t try anything new.</li>
            <li>Can be a little drying, so I use a light conditioner when washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I use no other!</li>
            <li>Personally, I find that the spray does, in fact, make my fine hair a little crunchy once the product dries.  </li>
            <li>However, I have long hair, so I wait till the spray dries thoroughly and then shake out my hair (or even gently run a brush or pick through it) and break up the crunchy feel.  </li>
            <li>It holds like no other.  </li>

            <li> but stay stiff through the day.</li>
            <li> The title &amp;#34;hard head&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean your hair will feel like a helmet after you</li>
            <li> Everytime I tried something different, it always disappointed by comparison.</li>
            <li> the packaging was terrible, the cans were shoved in a box that was to small and the lids were broken on both of the cans.</li>
            <li> Debated on buying a VERY expensive curling iron or curling wand.</li>

            <li> Love, love this hairspray! Great price and fast shipping!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! I have used it for awhile. Everytime I tried something different, it always disappointed by comparison. So, I don&#x27;t try anything new. I&#x27;m sticking with Bed Head.</li>
            <li> Will order again! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great price and product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for keeping your hair in place for an extended period. It was recommended to me for the dance recital. My daughter has several costume changes and it keeps her hair in a neat bun throughout the three hour recital!</li>
            <li> Love the product. the packaging was terrible, the cans were shoved in a box that was to small and the lids were broken on both of the cans.</li>
            <li> great price for good hairspray</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but this is the second time I didn&#x27;t get my order in two days.</li>
            <li> Best spray by far love, love, love it...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!! Debated on buying a VERY expensive curling iron or curling wand. After having this hair spray, NO NEED! Hair stays curled after being slept on. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. I&#x27;ve used other pricey sprays, and Bed Head Hard Head tops all of them by far.  I have long, fine hair that won&#x27;t hold curl for anything, and this hairspray helps exponentially. A little product goes a LONG way. Personally, I find that the spray does, in fact, make my fine hair a little crunchy once the product dries.  However, I have long hair, so I wait till the spray dries thoroughly and then shake out my hair (or even gently run a brush or pick through it) and break up the crunchy feel.  The curl still holds, but that helps eliminate that helmet head feel. If you have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl or a style, this is the hairspray for you.</li>
            <li> Really love this hair spray.  The only place I have found you could get it cheaper would be if you were a licensed beautician.</li>
            <li> Received it a day earlier than it said, which was wonderful because I was almost out! Arrived in perfect condition as well! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best ever.....working spray as well....but stay stiff through the day. I use no other!</li>
            <li> The best ever Hair Spray.</li>
            <li> Delivered well and works great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hairspray.  It holds like no other.  I have tried other hairsprays and they don&#x27;t measure up to Bedhead.  This is a great price even with the shipping it beats the price in local stores.</li>
            <li> Hope to see this amazing deal again, this is my all time favorite hair spray!</li>
            <li> It works really well with my Spice Cream &amp; sister Freeze Wax .&lt;br /&gt;that could hold my hair in style throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray! Great hold for hours!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and it was at the best price</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail hairspray!! This twin pack is the best bargain I have found. I have fine hair and this hairspray holds my curl all day. Cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li> Great to do business with always get my package within few days.  Love the product it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or heavy but holds</li>
            <li> Love this product and it was such a great deal!</li>
