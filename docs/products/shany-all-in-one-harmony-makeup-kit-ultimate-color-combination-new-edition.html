            <li>My daughter liked it ok but not as much as we thought we would...</li>
            <li>It has both shimmer and matt veriety of colors   easy to carry and pack saving you space and time   </li>
            <li>Easy to take along when traveling</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li>but the case falls apart really easy.</li>
            <li>I like the feature of it folding out it makes easy for storage.</li>
            <li>It did not have those bright vibrant colors as advertised.</li>
            <li>However, I do find that they smudge a bit easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to take with you to touch up just about any color.</li>
            <li>just wanted to say that for so many colors I think the price is great especially for someone who like to save like me.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to carry too.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry while travelling...</li>
            <li>Case does not have a latch so use caution when storing , as it  can reopen easily.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>I really love the whole set and the case comes in handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, on the bright side, I did get ~95 shadows, and they are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful all of the eyeshadows are and for only $25</li>
            <li>The makeup is pretty nice for the price.</li>
            <li>I like the colors they mostly are true but</li>
            <li>Not only is the presentation of this product absolutely beautiful, so are the shades, quality and longevity.</li>
            <li>If there were a less shimmery version, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li>The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li>It is a fine product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be fine as a gift to pre-teen who is experimenting with makeup, but to any adults, this is garbage.</li>
            <li>the eyeshadows are super cute and shimmery and the blushers are fab.......</li>
            <li>With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>The quality of makeup is as stated and very lovely and satisfying however was expecting a much more durable very fragile....</li>
            <li>High-end, high quality packaging, rich and brightly pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>AS IT MANY TIMES TO GET A NEW ONE, IT IS WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect from your little dancer to your volleyball girl.</li>
            <li>was able to get exactly what she wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Awesome gift for a little girl to play with makeup.</li>
            <li>when I came home and checked the mail there was a huge package on the doorstep with my boyfriend&#x27;s name on it.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Amazon shopper.  </li>
            <li>the colors look fabulous</li>
            <li>This is the perfect kit for the everyday women or even makeup artists.</li>
            <li>This totally would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>makes a great present too!</li>
            <li>The price is cheap and so is the product.  </li>
            <li>besides that, this is a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are amazing and the blush and lip gloss go very well with any of the eye shadow choices.</li>
            <li>Buy it today and be beauty fabulous .</li>
            <li>great to give as a gift for a beginner that are barley starting out.</li>
            <li>also bought a makeup brush kit in metallic purple for her to use to apply all of this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, and I must say that everyone in the room -----including the men-------left with some kind of makeup applied on their face, thanks to the 6 girls who were helping to apply it.  </li>
            <li>The blush is great, but I won&#x27;t actually use it.</li>
            <li>The ones it comes with are cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for your teenage daughters.</li>
            <li>This make-up kit has every color available.  </li>
            <li>its a great present for ages 8-14</li>
            <li>The packaging was faulty, but blame should also be placed on the manufacturer for making it so cheap but charging $30+ for it.</li>
            <li>Looks like it is amazing because it is so much, but don&#x27;t get fooled by the quantity.</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>so i apologize if someone confuse me as a male lol</li>
            <li>We bought this set for our daughter as &amp;#34;play makeup.&amp;#34;  It is a fantastic price for all that it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Couple of the brushes are on the cheap side- bristles fall</li>
            <li>price is low and the quality of the makeup is great.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and last all day!  </li>
            <li>Cheap too.</li>
            <li>But Overall I am happy with purchase and price.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li>This pallet is everything that a lady need to step out on the town looking and feeling fabulous as ever.</li>
            <li>The shadow to the blushes are very pigmented and nice.  </li>
            <li>It has a huge color choice and the pigmentation or color pay off is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The size is much smaller than anticipated but that would have been ok if the kit had arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li>When I recieved the makeup kit I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a good buy, only because I have brought plenty of make-up over the years and they don&#x27;t seem to show up on my carmel colored skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for its&#x27; value I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good gift as an entry level to doing makeup with the many different colors before deciding what works or not.</li>
            <li>it is everything i wanted.. and cheap to.. and will be getting more later.its colorful and sparkly..</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited to be ordering this makeup set, the colors looked exactly how I wanted them to, bright and colorful....</li>
            <li>Love the selection, if you can&#x27;t find the right color.</li>
            <li>think it is a complete and unique product , smells good ....</li>
            <li>This makeup goes on really smooth, and looks great for a long time.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail, And i did today.</li>
            <li>I was excited about finding the product.  </li>
            <li>It is small and compact, but perfect for space saving.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE you check them first.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors and they are pretty</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT AND COLOUR LASTS A LONG TIME</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but I do wish all the space they used for applicators was used for more lipsticks or blushes (maybe a few light ones)...</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting this product</li>
            <li>You can create thousands and thousands of unique looks with just this set.</li>
            <li>The matte eye shadows are decent and the shimmery ones are pretty good.</li>
            <li>It sort of looked as someone was trying to clean of prints with a wire brush.</li>
            <li>It has colors perfect for neutral and crazy bright looks.</li>
            <li>All the colors were beautiful and not blase browns as mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li>So many shades from neutrals to vibrant colors all that make your eyes pop!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find colors that work for me and the lip gloss is also wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was nice on her face and not harsh like some color packs can be</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed how compact it was it did not take up to much space in my bathroom</li>
            <li>you can only draw the conclusion that the company doesn&#x27;t care if the product arrives in good condition to you or not.  </li>
            <li>It was really cool when that happened.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily .</li>
            <li>This is a nice complete affordable kit for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The lasting of the eye shadows is good.</li>
            <li>Good selection, but the brushes fall apart and in my opinion there are not enough of them.</li>
            <li>So this kit is truely for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re fair skinned you&#x27;ll want to use a good primer under the brighter colors and especially the red shades since they can stain.</li>
            <li>But hey. I would recommend for your sweet heart.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered this produce , thinking it will be in good condition, had to return the 1st one already.</li>
            <li>and so far she has liked it.</li>
            <li>This is not bad for shipped makeup.</li>
            <li>Not a bad color pallets just wished I got what I ordered..</li>
            <li>Wide range of colors, very nice kit, should&#x27;ve bought one for myself too.</li>
            <li>yea sometimes the man needs to spend the other way and make eveyone happy.</li>
            <li>but anyways this is a great product and rly inexpensive as compare to other kits...</li>
            <li>The blushes are not very wearable, maybe better for darker skin tones, but I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
            <li>The other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that I really love the lipgloss and wish there was more of it in the kit :) I think for the price it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I love SHANY products, if you look in my room you will see probably 15 brushes and 2 huge (easily 300 different eye shadows) palettes.</li>
            <li>An applicator will make it too bold.</li>
            <li>So being the disgruntled customer I was, I quickly contacted Amazon and Joe(Or David..</li>
            <li>So many vibrant colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>My kit arrived in perfect condition with no broken or missing items.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me I have plenty of lipstick</li>
            <li>but we were not so lucky.  </li>
            <li>I must say i love Shany cosmetics, but they need to do something about this one product in particular -Jerrisa........</li>
            <li>Love the vibrant colours.</li>
            <li>I would definately come back for more make up shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I only \\&quot;tested\\&quot; a blue, but, it was bright!!</li>
            <li>and you are lucky if it arrives in one piece.</li>
            <li>SHIPPED OUT QUICK AND ARRIVED IN TIME FOR MOTHERS DAY.</li>
            <li>This was smaller than I had anticipated, but I love how compact it is and am very excited to try all the colors.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pretty and pigmented.</li>
            <li>up to amazon ;)....right now i am super excited bcoz</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the response I got, so I waited the weekend for the new one to arrive.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how this product has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now most people would return however for me they are minor and still love Shany cosmetics</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and I really like the cream eye shadows :)</li>
            <li>So shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li>i was amazed at how pretty the colors were,so i decided to buy this kit for myself!</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE SO MUCH MAKEUP TO CHOOSE FROM!!</li>
            <li>with much higher price points!</li>
            <li>Came in perfect condition, and has every color ever needed at least for me!</li>
            <li>there are very nice colors, and  you need so very little on the brush your using to make a huge impact</li>
            <li>This sturdy beautiful little black case packed quite a punch of nice saturated colors to choose from!</li>
            <li>This was easily her favorite present, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lip colors are more of a glossy texture and very soft, but they are fun to use over a lip stain.</li>
            <li>This set is amazing for a teen or preteen who loves makeup.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Fun with Make up&lt;br /&gt;bought</li>
            <li>This is way better than having a make-up bag filled with individual shadows, blushes, glosses, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>i never liked any type of makeup as much as i loved this eye shadows , im just in love with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper and more colors to pick from than many big named products.</li>
            <li>Fun item.</li>
            <li>dont worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely return items and have never given a one star rating, but this is a must for this item.</li>
            <li>The price I&#x27;d say is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I just completely fell in love with.</li>
            <li>Closed its about 6x6x3 good sise  </li>
            <li>Over all, this kit is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Def worth the price.</li>
            <li>the regular ones) are really nice.</li>
            <li>This product is a &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; present to buy for a child, but i honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommended it to anyone...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s everything you need for any fun colorful look.</li>
            <li>It has so many different shades and the shadows are so smooth.</li>
            <li>So overall, this is probably a good purchase if you don&#x27;t mind losing a couple shadows, and not being able to actually use the case like it&#x27;s intended...</li>
            <li>Its worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Shany 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit is really worth</li>
            <li>AND THAT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price...</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for teenage girl makeup parties or any other occasion when it would be fun to experiment with color.  </li>
            <li>Great for gift giving and can be compared to several other Top of the line cosmetic company&#x27;s promotional gift sets....</li>
            <li>The price right as you get your moneys worth once you make an investment.</li>
            <li>I must say i viewed this product many time, i even read the  reviews of other customer, and many list this product as being defective.</li>
            <li>I love first and foremost how soft they glide on!</li>
            <li>Other wise all the powders were in tact.</li>
            <li>But other than that.. a good product..</li>
            <li>If you think the price is right, it is.  </li>
            <li>She expressed excitement to find the right colors for each outfit.</li>
            <li>The box is easy for her to drag around the house and it has been many hours of fun for her.</li>
            <li>However the colors all look very pretty, And Ive bought this brand before and know personally there a good quality ( as far as how they go on &amp; stay )</li>
            <li>The shadows look like they could have really been nice, beautiful colors, huge variety, except that one of the hinges was broken therefore causing every single eyeshadow except for the very top row before you open it all the way, to be shattered.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and its pretty fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>is actually quit large but folds up into a nice cube shape.</li>
            <li>im in love with this little kit is so adorable</li>
            <li>And this nifty little case had all sorts of colors :) I immediately played with as many colors as I could.</li>
            <li>The shimmer shadows are brilliant and very soft as well, however they are not quite as vibrant as the other colors when they are on your skin.</li>
            <li>I fixed it by smoothing it over and fixed the applicator with some glue and now everything looks as good as new!.</li>
            <li>you can possibly imagine and at such a great price too.</li>
            <li>Purchased for personal use, but this would make a great gift for someone starting their makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Has made for a great learning tool for my daughter, especially for the eyes and for the low cost, I don&#x27;t care if it gets messed up.</li>
            <li>I felt like Amazon did a good job to fix their previous errors.</li>
            <li>As always with prime shipping, you get the package super fast and do not have to deal with the uncertainty of evilbay.</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art but not sure if they want to spend alot of money on higher quality make up.</li>
            <li>Hands down great make up you get loads of fabulous color and different styles out of this kit.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>it was a gift and my niece like it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shadows are fairly pigmented, extremely blendable and very wearable.</li>
            <li>This would make a great gift for anyone who loves makeup, especially for someone who does other people&#x27;s faces, thus using the full range of the palette.  </li>
            <li>ITS COMES WITH 168 VERY PIGMENTED EYESHADOWS, 3 BLUSHES, AND 6 LIP GLOSSES; WHICH ARE ALL VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li>It has so many eye shadows you can easily do a month and half of eye shadow looks and NEVER repeat a look.</li>
            <li>She kept opening and sliding and was quite impressed with how much make up this little box actually holds!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks exactly as shown and</li>
            <li>Although they are many colors to choose from, please be advised that they are tiny cells.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeeee this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li>, I thought I did pretty well with this one.</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect, no cracks or anything wrong with the shadows.  </li>
            <li>Her first makeup kit to use as an estatition to practice</li>
            <li>Also, the slides to pull them out broke on the first day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend; buy a sligtly higher priced product instead or a brand you know</li>
            <li>I would definitely say it is more for summer than winter with the shading, but it keeps well.</li>
            <li>Well made product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They look pretty in the pan</li>
            <li>They are pretty.</li>
            <li>Fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li>First thing first, as for picture to product.</li>
            <li>Not as pigmented as my MAC and pro line colors, but with a dab of water mixed in goes on like liquid with a stronger, more saturated hue.</li>
            <li>girlfriend present, she love it</li>
            <li>He has mostly been receiving the silent treatment ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li>I had better be getting my money back.</li>
            <li>this product is really a life saver!</li>
            <li>and there is so much variety!</li>
            <li>It comes with so much variety!</li>
            <li>This would not even be comparable to a \\&quot;my first make up kit\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these sets for gifts this holiday season.</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors of eye shadow&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Also, reading the customer reviews really sparked my curiosity in this product!</li>
            <li>First it arrived intact with no breakege.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed my friends reaction when she received this as a birthday present.</li>
            <li>kit makes it possible for her to be creative without breaking my wallet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the first eyeshadow I have purchased that I can wear and it doesn&#x27;t fade away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>of pretty colors.</li>
            <li>there are so many different colors for every mood you are in each day or for whatever outfit you are wearing!</li>
            <li>Last, I love the case provided for these luminous shadows....</li>
            <li>one of the pallets was popped out when she got it, but she was able to get it popped back</li>
            <li>I definitely will buy more products from this company again!!!</li>
            <li>I love Amazon on these situations and wish they would go a step further and weed out junk products like this.</li>
            <li>Shany Cosmetics never fails.</li>
            <li>My 17 yr old daughter loves her makeup and has a very distinct style</li>
            <li>This beautiful set of eyeshadows and blushes gives you variety of colors in such small and unique packaging  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, came right on time.  </li>
            <li>Other than that colors are nice.</li>
            <li>I purchase item for my 10 yr old daughter who loves make-up and doing her dolls hair, but product came wrap nicely but once open from the bubble wrap..</li>
            <li>It it such a good gift idea for anyone who loves makeup or just starting out.</li>
            <li>Daughter LOVES and WELL worth fabulous, low price for what you get.  </li>
            <li>it much curer then described actually I may be buying more for xmas gifts...</li>
            <li>I did ready that it was only two pounds, but still I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Goes on soft and smooth, really shimmery.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the make-up, I really don&#x27;t know, but if missing some of it is any indication, then probably not that great.</li>
            <li>it basically has pretty much all you need all the colors you could think of.</li>
            <li>so she won&#x27;t mind too much, plus they are colors that she won&#x27;t use anyway; if it were a gift for someone other than my own child, I&#x27;d be a bit upset.</li>
            <li>she is following her sister&#x27;s steps of becoming a makeup addict XD)</li>
            <li>i seriously cannot wait to order more and start using them on my clients!!</li>
            <li>The makeup seems to be high quality and the price is right for everything that is included.</li>
            <li>I found the super beautiful makeup but vei very broken</li>
            <li>And third the colors are true to themselves!</li>
            <li>a lot of the light blues and greens look exactly the same when on your eye.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>(my wife has me buy large bags because that&#x27;s the style now)</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that I wad receiving the large make</li>
            <li>The colors is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>There were much variety and choices in a smart case.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a 14 year old, her mother now wants one!!</li>
            <li>The blushes and eye shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I should say that this item is a real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and she really needs it</li>
            <li>my cousin has one and every time we are getting ready to go out</li>
            <li>After looking at this over and over, I did get the whole kit for niece.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>, For me i felt like this really was like a mini preview.</li>
            <li>The price is low, but this product is no way cheap.</li>
            <li>However, when I received it not so much.</li>
            <li>whole thing fell apart.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic and looks</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much makeup that it will probably take forever to finish.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>thanks you anyways</li>
            <li>Esta bellisimo thanks</li>
            <li>But I find that some of the eye shadows contain too much oil.</li>
            <li>I really received what the product and seller described.</li>
            <li>So she was really lost for words</li>
            <li>It is very well packaged and convenient to store.  </li>
            <li>Make up shreds too much.</li>
            <li>but they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>They will show up on any skin tone and you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colours are VERY shimmery and do not have a lot of pigment.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I hear her talking to herself asking what color she wants to use today.</li>
            <li>think that is very unprofessional</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t have this product, I REALLY WANT to get it.  </li>
            <li>so thanks</li>
            <li>Really a bummer.  </li>
            <li>this product is very old,you can not use it.</li>
            <li>and I did not know if she really like it or not</li>
            <li>Excelent Product for a gift.. compact and modern..</li>
            <li>What I expected and more</li>
            <li>I had purchased this as a gift for a friend who wants to be a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>If you are also just starting out with your makeup collection and want a big selection this a great starting product.</li>
            <li>It came on time &amp; no broken pieces of eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I really like this palette</li>
            <li>thank you so much ...</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re like me, and that doesn&#x27;t bother you too much, then, order.</li>
            <li>The Box it came in was very scratched up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the blush</li>
            <li>but I use the shadows very often.</li>
            <li>And I must say that these eyeshadows are very pigmented, and show up well on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality!</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed that I cannot use this product seeing as I payed for it and got something I was not expecting.</li>
            <li>so i love pink eyeshadows</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality!</li>
            <li>There is alot of selection and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>This set really just has it all.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of makeup</li>
            <li>It is very finiky to close.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t buy this much product for that price ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I expected it to be bigger but its compact and a good size</li>
            <li>you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  </li>
            <li>Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment</li>
            <li>The colors become more vibrant when you use a liner pencil the same color to outline your eyes and softly and lightly brush the same color shadow on!</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to try different color combinations!</li>
            <li>which was a bummer, but other than that the product rocks :)</li>
            <li>Anyway if you are familiar with the 120, or 180 palettes, this is the same quality as those.</li>
            <li>I do have a review on my blog and starting to do tutorials, check them out just to see how rich the color is [...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never tell her how much I paid for it though (mainly because she won&#x27;t believe me)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a small mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>The moment I opened the first sliding door, it slid completely off</li>
            <li>When I picked the box with full excitement as I bought it as a gift for my sister, I want my money back and a home pick for this, I already had to go so far to return the first one,</li>
            <li>I love that the possibilities of eye looks are endless!</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled with all those colors and options but honestly, the product came in really bad condition.</li>
            <li>One of the previous reviews says that they need to package their products better.  </li>
            <li>the black case of makeup is scratched all over top</li>
            <li>Create the smokey eye look, the classic eye look, the neutral eye look, etc.</li>
            <li>I do makeup for a living, and recently purchased this kit to be able to minimize the use of having to carry about 20 different palettes to get the colors I want.</li>
            <li>so we sent it back and got a replacement fairly quick</li>
            <li>There are so many different colors and it will last for a while.</li>
            <li>They were still vibrant after 8 hours dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case on the first one I bought is in great condition now the second one was broken.</li>
            <li>They were smaller than I thought but still very pretty.</li>
            <li>I have medium toned skin and am always scouting for highly pigmented shades, whether it&#x27;s eye/lip/cheek colors.</li>
            <li>Designed in USA and manufactured in a factory which makes high end cosmetics</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The pastel colors are still very vibrant and soft.</li>
            <li>I have fixed the problem by putting a small piece of tap on the top of the mirror creating a little lift for it to open it more easily.</li>
            <li>I think the little kit itself is adorable, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any guy looking to buy a cool present for a young girl.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy and apologized for getting angry.</li>
            <li>nearly everything you need is in this kit and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It was very neatly packed and arrived early.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I love the long lasting wear they provide!</li>
            <li>Normally &amp;#34;set&amp;#34</li>
            <li>not bad but not great :)</li>
            <li>The colors are nice but breaks off easily got the kit with a few broken colors also the brushes are not strong they break easily but other than that got great colors and the colors last</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that since it is not shipped directly from Amazon you can&#x27;t request a replacement, you can only get an standard refund after they get the returned package, so my credit card wont be credited for several days, I honestly don&#x27;t mind getting a refund instead of a replacement since their quality control appears lacking.</li>
            <li>had it been in new condition</li>
            <li>I wanted new makeup for my birthday.</li>
            <li>whatever)said that they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li>Today the new shadow kit arrived.</li>
            <li>I look forward to going out and putting on a new color with my outfits.</li>
            <li>Will return it and see if the new one matches uo</li>
            <li>new.</li>
            <li>no doubt it&#x27;s in best condition,nothing is broken or missing...</li>
            <li>Again this goes with them being VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old LOVES this!</li>
            <li>but since she has medium to dark skin, she has to put on a light coat, or it&#x27;ll look chalky.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Just received this today and it was a gift for my daughter, one color of blush is completely gone like it was used as well as two of the eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>The only explanation for it not being being there is that it was NEVER there in the first place.</li>
            <li>The collection of colors and different types of use is giving a wide range of selections, and also when combining the colors, they give a nice impression, my wife said she recommend it to every girl and women equally.</li>
            <li>depth I wanted and faded and brushed off easily when applied dry</li>
            <li>Despite all that, I really just wanted a nicer variety of eyeshadows without having to dish out the big bucks for some high end make up</li>
            <li>The colors last for a long time (I use primer), and they are super rich and don&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
            <li>they are all really drab and dark and mostly lighter and darker versions of the same colors, plus when I first opened the package, 3 of the eyeshadows were completely crushed and all over the place.</li>
            <li>The round color can removed easily from the box ..</li>
            <li>What seemed neat to me was the way that this kit folded open to reveal three trays full of different colors of......ummm.....stuff?  </li>
            <li>As the other reviews said, I was hoping to be a lucky one and get an item that looks like new but guess what?</li>
            <li>I gave this four stars because apon recieving this the box was already broken however I love this eyeshadow and all the color choices!</li>
            <li>With so many positive reviews I chanced purchasing this hoping that this one would be one that wasn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li>She only uses certain colors.  </li>
            <li>The case has every color you should ever need from lights to darks from browns to yellows, it really has allot in a little box,the box is little and tucks out of the way nicely.</li>
            <li>The pop-up mirror was definitely one her favorite little kinks.</li>
            <li>but when you open it up you have so much to work with.</li>
            <li>Now my 7 and 8 yr old kids play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>turns out the whole back was cracked.</li>
            <li>I ordered this along with Shany Cosmetics 32 professional brush kit</li>
            <li>13 year old and 16 year old</li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my 9 year old godchild who is just beginning to have an interest in girly stuff.  </li>
            <li>After that I was completely upset because I&#x27;d already ordered it</li>
            <li>also, shadows are EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li>I may end up giving it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li>got it for my 8 year old cousin and she loves it.</li>
            <li>When you open It you cant believe how much product you get.</li>
            <li>Like completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>My Shany Product arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>Every time I see big makeup sets like this, I am very worried about the quality.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys using it daily.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 16 year old cousin.  </li>
            <li>once I saw how much was actually inside!  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>When i open this up I have so much to choose from.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B002DOO1VA SHANY Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li>All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]][[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li>So much so that I&#x27;d rather take a loss than deal with the company and try to get my money back.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 6 year old daughter</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 9 years old.  </li>
            <li>This kit contains everything you need to complete a look.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>but it was worth every penny I spent for it</li>
            <li>Sorry this item had the blush destroyed wasnt packed good .</li>
            <li>I would not recommend you purchase the product, and sadly it may turn out to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>and honestly I have not looked beyond that to see if anything else is broken.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i saw the little box with the Shany trademark on it, but that excitement flew out the window as soon as i took it out the box.</li>
            <li>there is no protective cover on the cells and when the box is closed the cells will be on top of each other.  </li>
            <li>design is DEFINITELY cute however, I wish it came with protective covering so it wouldn&#x27;t spill onto the other colors when it&#x27;s closed.</li>
            <li>We kept finding more and more stuff behind each little layer!  </li>
            <li>Shany is just as good (if not better) as the high end makeup brands, but ordinary people can afford them.</li>
            <li>I do not have super large fingers and find it hard to get my fingers into the provided lift</li>
            <li>I am disappointed that they are mostly blues and golds and mostly muted tones.</li>
            <li>Mine came in decent condition - only one pigment broke on its way.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product it has many colors.. whoever buys this will NOT be disappointed. ..</li>
            <li>Never again will I spend more money then necessary on \\&quot;high- end\\&quot; products when this is just the same if not better then them.</li>
            <li>When I received the product, I immediately opened it and was pleasantly surprised that every single eyeshadow was in place and not broken.</li>
            <li>At first, my goddaughter thought that it was just the two sides that display when you first open, but I remembered that there were supposed to be several different trays, so we started pushing and pulling on the thing until all of a sudden a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; tray on each side slid open.  </li>
            <li>The powder comes up easily instead of being hard (which is a plus), and It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I RETURNED THIS ITEM TWICE, AND THE THIRD ONE I RECEIVED WAS IN NEW CONDITION</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asking for an exchange, hope the second one sent will be in new condition.</li>
            <li>Just be aware because you might have a few broken eyeshadows other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>but the colors aren&#x27;t as bright as it shows and I found them to be hard to get dark enough</li>
            <li>Honestly I was expecting a few of them to be a little broken up but was ok w/that.</li>
            <li>But the only problem was that my shiny white was broken ;( Other then that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>VERY SMALL BUT DURABLE, EASY TO CARRY WITH YOU</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how shimmery the eyeshadow is because it makes me feel like I can only wear it for special occasions instead of everyday.</li>
            <li>I can see the validity of the craftsmanship being sub par as the trays do completely slide out, but you can put them back no problem.</li>
            <li>we will be seeing you again in the near future..</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 was the hinge on the box was broke when I got it out of the box  but superglue fixed that</li>
            <li>Upon arriving I found the only issue was the hot pink blush</li>
            <li>and I can see too many broken peices in the box.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li>Came partially broken, but mostly intact.</li>
            <li>Many of the powders were dislodged, broken and unusable.</li>
            <li>I was not happy, I thought I was going to be satisfied</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that each color has a small pot so when you find a favorite, you&#x27;ll have a limited amount.  </li>
            <li>Every single piece is highly pigmented and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>Mine last long and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>I had to gently blow out the color dust as it was resting on the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>We buy 75% of all our goods on Amazon and this is a rare and huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>My brother and his wife bought me this for my birthday last year and when I got it the case was broken along with most of the make up in the case.</li>
            <li>Go spend the extra few dollars and get something worth it.</li>
            <li>When she came back I found that many the blush is damaged and broken.</li>
            <li>This little box has so much to offer!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about purchasing this item at first.</li>
            <li>Not long wearing tho.</li>
            <li>The mirror broke off within the first few weeks</li>
            <li>Im not sure its worth this price.</li>
            <li>, the two palettes underneath do not slide out very easily and some of the individual colors  are loose and contributes to the case not sliding properly which can be frustrating to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lip colors are super sheer and unnoticeable and they dry out after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow colors were a little repetitive , would have like to have more lip selections or bigger sample sizes.</li>
            <li>The style of it just drives me crazy how cute it is!</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine, nothing was broken at all.</li>
            <li>there was so much in this tiny little box.  </li>

            <li> Its a nice kit.</li>
            <li> but it really is a nice nice kit.</li>

            <li> This product has great colors and nice eyeshadows, but is made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> But once again there is ALOT of colors to chose from, and a nice plus it all folds up nice and compact.</li>
            <li> I had my girl friend search online for something she liked.</li>

            <li> It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li> but the case falls apart really easy.</li>
            <li> I like the feature of it folding out it makes easy for storage.</li>
            <li> It did not have those bright vibrant colors as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, I do find that they smudge a bit easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to take with you to touch up just about any color.</li>
            <li> just wanted to say that for so many colors I think the price is great especially for someone who like to save like me.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to carry too.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry while travelling...</li>
            <li> Case does not have a latch so use caution when storing , as it  can reopen easily.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love the whole set and the case comes in handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, on the bright side, I did get ~95 shadows, and they are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful all of the eyeshadows are and for only $25</li>
            <li> The makeup is pretty nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the colors they mostly are true but</li>
            <li> Not only is the presentation of this product absolutely beautiful, so are the shades, quality and longevity.</li>
            <li> If there were a less shimmery version, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li> It is a fine product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be fine as a gift to pre-teen who is experimenting with makeup, but to any adults, this is garbage.</li>
            <li> the eyeshadows are super cute and shimmery and the blushers are fab.......</li>
            <li> With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> The quality of makeup is as stated and very lovely and satisfying however was expecting a much more durable very fragile....</li>
            <li> High-end, high quality packaging, rich and brightly pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> AS IT MANY TIMES TO GET A NEW ONE, IT IS WORTH IT!!!</li>

            <li> was able to get exactly what she wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Awesome gift for a little girl to play with makeup.</li>
            <li> when I came home and checked the mail there was a huge package on the doorstep with my boyfriend&#x27;s name on it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Amazon shopper.  </li>
            <li> the colors look fabulous</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit for the everyday women or even makeup artists.</li>
            <li> This totally would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> makes a great present too!</li>
            <li> The price is cheap and so is the product.  </li>
            <li> besides that, this is a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are amazing and the blush and lip gloss go very well with any of the eye shadow choices.</li>
            <li> Buy it today and be beauty fabulous .</li>
            <li> great to give as a gift for a beginner that are barley starting out.</li>
            <li> also bought a makeup brush kit in metallic purple for her to use to apply all of this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, and I must say that everyone in the room -----including the men-------left with some kind of makeup applied on their face, thanks to the 6 girls who were helping to apply it.  </li>
            <li> The blush is great, but I won&#x27;t actually use it.</li>
            <li> The ones it comes with are cheap.</li>
            <li> Great for your teenage daughters.</li>
            <li> This make-up kit has every color available.  </li>
            <li> its a great present for ages 8-14</li>
            <li> The packaging was faulty, but blame should also be placed on the manufacturer for making it so cheap but charging $30+ for it.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is amazing because it is so much, but don&#x27;t get fooled by the quantity.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li> so i apologize if someone confuse me as a male lol</li>
            <li> We bought this set for our daughter as &amp;#34;play makeup.&amp;#34;  It is a fantastic price for all that it comes with.  </li>
            <li> Couple of the brushes are on the cheap side- bristles fall</li>
            <li> price is low and the quality of the makeup is great.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and last all day!  </li>
            <li> Cheap too.</li>
            <li> But Overall I am happy with purchase and price.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li> This pallet is everything that a lady need to step out on the town looking and feeling fabulous as ever.</li>
            <li> The shadow to the blushes are very pigmented and nice.  </li>
            <li> It has a huge color choice and the pigmentation or color pay off is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The size is much smaller than anticipated but that would have been ok if the kit had arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the makeup kit I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a good buy, only because I have brought plenty of make-up over the years and they don&#x27;t seem to show up on my carmel colored skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise for its&#x27; value I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good gift as an entry level to doing makeup with the many different colors before deciding what works or not.</li>
            <li> it is everything i wanted.. and cheap to.. and will be getting more later.its colorful and sparkly..</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited to be ordering this makeup set, the colors looked exactly how I wanted them to, bright and colorful....</li>
            <li> Love the selection, if you can&#x27;t find the right color.</li>
            <li> think it is a complete and unique product , smells good ....</li>
            <li> This makeup goes on really smooth, and looks great for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail, And i did today.</li>
            <li> I was excited about finding the product.  </li>
            <li> It is small and compact, but perfect for space saving.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE you check them first.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and they are pretty</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND COLOUR LASTS A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but I do wish all the space they used for applicators was used for more lipsticks or blushes (maybe a few light ones)...</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this product</li>
            <li> You can create thousands and thousands of unique looks with just this set.</li>
            <li> The matte eye shadows are decent and the shimmery ones are pretty good.</li>
            <li> It sort of looked as someone was trying to clean of prints with a wire brush.</li>
            <li> It has colors perfect for neutral and crazy bright looks.</li>
            <li> All the colors were beautiful and not blase browns as mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li> So many shades from neutrals to vibrant colors all that make your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find colors that work for me and the lip gloss is also wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was nice on her face and not harsh like some color packs can be</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed how compact it was it did not take up to much space in my bathroom</li>
            <li> you can only draw the conclusion that the company doesn&#x27;t care if the product arrives in good condition to you or not.  </li>
            <li> It was really cool when that happened.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily .</li>
            <li> This is a nice complete affordable kit for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The lasting of the eye shadows is good.</li>
            <li> Good selection, but the brushes fall apart and in my opinion there are not enough of them.</li>
            <li> So this kit is truely for anyone.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re fair skinned you&#x27;ll want to use a good primer under the brighter colors and especially the red shades since they can stain.</li>
            <li> But hey. I would recommend for your sweet heart.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this produce , thinking it will be in good condition, had to return the 1st one already.</li>
            <li> and so far she has liked it.</li>
            <li> This is not bad for shipped makeup.</li>
            <li> Not a bad color pallets just wished I got what I ordered..</li>
            <li> Wide range of colors, very nice kit, should&#x27;ve bought one for myself too.</li>
            <li> yea sometimes the man needs to spend the other way and make eveyone happy.</li>
            <li> but anyways this is a great product and rly inexpensive as compare to other kits...</li>
            <li> The blushes are not very wearable, maybe better for darker skin tones, but I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
            <li> The other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that I really love the lipgloss and wish there was more of it in the kit :) I think for the price it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love SHANY products, if you look in my room you will see probably 15 brushes and 2 huge (easily 300 different eye shadows) palettes.</li>
            <li> An applicator will make it too bold.</li>
            <li> So being the disgruntled customer I was, I quickly contacted Amazon and Joe(Or David..</li>
            <li> So many vibrant colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> My kit arrived in perfect condition with no broken or missing items.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me I have plenty of lipstick</li>
            <li> but we were not so lucky.  </li>
            <li> I must say i love Shany cosmetics, but they need to do something about this one product in particular -Jerrisa........</li>
            <li> Love the vibrant colours.</li>
            <li> I would definately come back for more make up shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I only \\&quot;tested\\&quot; a blue, but, it was bright!!</li>
            <li> and you are lucky if it arrives in one piece.</li>
            <li> SHIPPED OUT QUICK AND ARRIVED IN TIME FOR MOTHERS DAY.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I had anticipated, but I love how compact it is and am very excited to try all the colors.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very pretty and pigmented.</li>
            <li> up to amazon ;)....right now i am super excited bcoz</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the response I got, so I waited the weekend for the new one to arrive.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now most people would return however for me they are minor and still love Shany cosmetics</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and I really like the cream eye shadows :)</li>
            <li> So shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li> i was amazed at how pretty the colors were,so i decided to buy this kit for myself!</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE SO MUCH MAKEUP TO CHOOSE FROM!!</li>
            <li> with much higher price points!</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition, and has every color ever needed at least for me!</li>
            <li> there are very nice colors, and  you need so very little on the brush your using to make a huge impact</li>
            <li> This sturdy beautiful little black case packed quite a punch of nice saturated colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> This was easily her favorite present, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lip colors are more of a glossy texture and very soft, but they are fun to use over a lip stain.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing for a teen or preteen who loves makeup.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Fun with Make up&lt;br /&gt;bought</li>
            <li> This is way better than having a make-up bag filled with individual shadows, blushes, glosses, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i never liked any type of makeup as much as i loved this eye shadows , im just in love with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper and more colors to pick from than many big named products.</li>
            <li> Fun item.</li>
            <li> dont worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely return items and have never given a one star rating, but this is a must for this item.</li>
            <li> The price I&#x27;d say is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I just completely fell in love with.</li>
            <li> Closed its about 6x6x3 good sise  </li>
            <li> Over all, this kit is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Def worth the price.</li>
            <li> the regular ones) are really nice.</li>
            <li> This product is a &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; present to buy for a child, but i honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommended it to anyone...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s everything you need for any fun colorful look.</li>
            <li> It has so many different shades and the shadows are so smooth.</li>
            <li> So overall, this is probably a good purchase if you don&#x27;t mind losing a couple shadows, and not being able to actually use the case like it&#x27;s intended...</li>
            <li> Its worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shany 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit is really worth</li>
            <li> AND THAT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price...</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect for teenage girl makeup parties or any other occasion when it would be fun to experiment with color.  </li>
            <li> Great for gift giving and can be compared to several other Top of the line cosmetic company&#x27;s promotional gift sets....</li>
            <li> The price right as you get your moneys worth once you make an investment.</li>
            <li> I must say i viewed this product many time, i even read the  reviews of other customer, and many list this product as being defective.</li>
            <li> I love first and foremost how soft they glide on!</li>
            <li> Other wise all the powders were in tact.</li>
            <li> But other than that.. a good product..</li>
            <li> If you think the price is right, it is.  </li>
            <li> She expressed excitement to find the right colors for each outfit.</li>
            <li> The box is easy for her to drag around the house and it has been many hours of fun for her.</li>
            <li> However the colors all look very pretty, And Ive bought this brand before and know personally there a good quality ( as far as how they go on &amp; stay )</li>
            <li> The shadows look like they could have really been nice, beautiful colors, huge variety, except that one of the hinges was broken therefore causing every single eyeshadow except for the very top row before you open it all the way, to be shattered.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and its pretty fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> is actually quit large but folds up into a nice cube shape.</li>
            <li> im in love with this little kit is so adorable</li>
            <li> And this nifty little case had all sorts of colors :) I immediately played with as many colors as I could.</li>
            <li> The shimmer shadows are brilliant and very soft as well, however they are not quite as vibrant as the other colors when they are on your skin.</li>
            <li> I fixed it by smoothing it over and fixed the applicator with some glue and now everything looks as good as new!.</li>
            <li> you can possibly imagine and at such a great price too.</li>
            <li> Purchased for personal use, but this would make a great gift for someone starting their makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Has made for a great learning tool for my daughter, especially for the eyes and for the low cost, I don&#x27;t care if it gets messed up.</li>
            <li> I felt like Amazon did a good job to fix their previous errors.</li>
            <li> As always with prime shipping, you get the package super fast and do not have to deal with the uncertainty of evilbay.</li>
            <li> This would be a great gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art but not sure if they want to spend alot of money on higher quality make up.</li>
            <li> Hands down great make up you get loads of fabulous color and different styles out of this kit.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> it was a gift and my niece like it very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shadows are fairly pigmented, extremely blendable and very wearable.</li>
            <li> This would make a great gift for anyone who loves makeup, especially for someone who does other people&#x27;s faces, thus using the full range of the palette.  </li>
            <li> ITS COMES WITH 168 VERY PIGMENTED EYESHADOWS, 3 BLUSHES, AND 6 LIP GLOSSES; WHICH ARE ALL VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li> It has so many eye shadows you can easily do a month and half of eye shadow looks and NEVER repeat a look.</li>
            <li> She kept opening and sliding and was quite impressed with how much make up this little box actually holds!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks exactly as shown and</li>
            <li> Although they are many colors to choose from, please be advised that they are tiny cells.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeeee this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li> , I thought I did pretty well with this one.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, no cracks or anything wrong with the shadows.  </li>
            <li> Her first makeup kit to use as an estatition to practice</li>
            <li> Also, the slides to pull them out broke on the first day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend; buy a sligtly higher priced product instead or a brand you know</li>
            <li> I would definitely say it is more for summer than winter with the shading, but it keeps well.</li>
            <li> Well made product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They look pretty in the pan</li>
            <li> They are pretty.</li>
            <li> Fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li> First thing first, as for picture to product.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as my MAC and pro line colors, but with a dab of water mixed in goes on like liquid with a stronger, more saturated hue.</li>
            <li> girlfriend present, she love it</li>
            <li> He has mostly been receiving the silent treatment ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li> I had better be getting my money back.</li>
            <li> this product is really a life saver!</li>
            <li> and there is so much variety!</li>
            <li> It comes with so much variety!</li>
            <li> This would not even be comparable to a \\&quot;my first make up kit\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these sets for gifts this holiday season.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors of eye shadow&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also, reading the customer reviews really sparked my curiosity in this product!</li>
            <li> First it arrived intact with no breakege.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my friends reaction when she received this as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> kit makes it possible for her to be creative without breaking my wallet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the first eyeshadow I have purchased that I can wear and it doesn&#x27;t fade away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> of pretty colors.</li>
            <li> there are so many different colors for every mood you are in each day or for whatever outfit you are wearing!</li>
            <li> Last, I love the case provided for these luminous shadows....</li>
            <li> one of the pallets was popped out when she got it, but she was able to get it popped back</li>
            <li> I definitely will buy more products from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> I love Amazon on these situations and wish they would go a step further and weed out junk products like this.</li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics never fails.</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old daughter loves her makeup and has a very distinct style</li>
            <li> This beautiful set of eyeshadows and blushes gives you variety of colors in such small and unique packaging  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, came right on time.  </li>
            <li> Other than that colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I purchase item for my 10 yr old daughter who loves make-up and doing her dolls hair, but product came wrap nicely but once open from the bubble wrap..</li>
            <li> It it such a good gift idea for anyone who loves makeup or just starting out.</li>
            <li> Daughter LOVES and WELL worth fabulous, low price for what you get.  </li>
            <li> it much curer then described actually I may be buying more for xmas gifts...</li>
            <li> I did ready that it was only two pounds, but still I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Goes on soft and smooth, really shimmery.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the make-up, I really don&#x27;t know, but if missing some of it is any indication, then probably not that great.</li>
            <li> it basically has pretty much all you need all the colors you could think of.</li>
            <li> so she won&#x27;t mind too much, plus they are colors that she won&#x27;t use anyway; if it were a gift for someone other than my own child, I&#x27;d be a bit upset.</li>
            <li> she is following her sister&#x27;s steps of becoming a makeup addict XD)</li>
            <li> i seriously cannot wait to order more and start using them on my clients!!</li>
            <li> The makeup seems to be high quality and the price is right for everything that is included.</li>
            <li> I found the super beautiful makeup but vei very broken</li>
            <li> And third the colors are true to themselves!</li>
            <li> a lot of the light blues and greens look exactly the same when on your eye.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> (my wife has me buy large bags because that&#x27;s the style now)</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I wad receiving the large make</li>
            <li> The colors is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> There were much variety and choices in a smart case.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a 14 year old, her mother now wants one!!</li>
            <li> The blushes and eye shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I should say that this item is a real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and she really needs it</li>
            <li> my cousin has one and every time we are getting ready to go out</li>
            <li> After looking at this over and over, I did get the whole kit for niece.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> , For me i felt like this really was like a mini preview.</li>
            <li> The price is low, but this product is no way cheap.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it not so much.</li>
            <li> whole thing fell apart.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic and looks</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much makeup that it will probably take forever to finish.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> thanks you anyways</li>
            <li> Esta bellisimo thanks</li>
            <li> But I find that some of the eye shadows contain too much oil.</li>
            <li> I really received what the product and seller described.</li>
            <li> So she was really lost for words</li>
            <li> It is very well packaged and convenient to store.  </li>
            <li> Make up shreds too much.</li>
            <li> but they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> They will show up on any skin tone and you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colours are VERY shimmery and do not have a lot of pigment.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I hear her talking to herself asking what color she wants to use today.</li>
            <li> think that is very unprofessional</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have this product, I REALLY WANT to get it.  </li>
            <li> so thanks</li>
            <li> Really a bummer.  </li>
            <li> this product is very old,you can not use it.</li>
            <li> and I did not know if she really like it or not</li>
            <li> Excelent Product for a gift.. compact and modern..</li>
            <li> What I expected and more</li>
            <li> I had purchased this as a gift for a friend who wants to be a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> If you are also just starting out with your makeup collection and want a big selection this a great starting product.</li>
            <li> It came on time &amp; no broken pieces of eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I really like this palette</li>
            <li> thank you so much ...</li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re like me, and that doesn&#x27;t bother you too much, then, order.</li>
            <li> The Box it came in was very scratched up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the blush</li>
            <li> but I use the shadows very often.</li>
            <li> And I must say that these eyeshadows are very pigmented, and show up well on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality!</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed that I cannot use this product seeing as I payed for it and got something I was not expecting.</li>
            <li> so i love pink eyeshadows</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality!</li>
            <li> There is alot of selection and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This set really just has it all.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of makeup</li>
            <li> It is very finiky to close.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy this much product for that price ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I expected it to be bigger but its compact and a good size</li>
            <li> you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  </li>
            <li> Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment</li>
            <li> The colors become more vibrant when you use a liner pencil the same color to outline your eyes and softly and lightly brush the same color shadow on!</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to try different color combinations!</li>
            <li> which was a bummer, but other than that the product rocks :)</li>
            <li> Anyway if you are familiar with the 120, or 180 palettes, this is the same quality as those.</li>
            <li> I do have a review on my blog and starting to do tutorials, check them out just to see how rich the color is [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never tell her how much I paid for it though (mainly because she won&#x27;t believe me)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  </li>
            <li> The moment I opened the first sliding door, it slid completely off</li>
            <li> When I picked the box with full excitement as I bought it as a gift for my sister, I want my money back and a home pick for this, I already had to go so far to return the first one,</li>
            <li> I love that the possibilities of eye looks are endless!</li>
            <li> and she was thrilled with all those colors and options but honestly, the product came in really bad condition.</li>
            <li> One of the previous reviews says that they need to package their products better.  </li>
            <li> the black case of makeup is scratched all over top</li>
            <li> Create the smokey eye look, the classic eye look, the neutral eye look, etc.</li>
            <li> I do makeup for a living, and recently purchased this kit to be able to minimize the use of having to carry about 20 different palettes to get the colors I want.</li>
            <li> so we sent it back and got a replacement fairly quick</li>
            <li> There are so many different colors and it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> They were still vibrant after 8 hours dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case on the first one I bought is in great condition now the second one was broken.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I thought but still very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have medium toned skin and am always scouting for highly pigmented shades, whether it&#x27;s eye/lip/cheek colors.</li>
            <li> Designed in USA and manufactured in a factory which makes high end cosmetics</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The pastel colors are still very vibrant and soft.</li>
            <li> I have fixed the problem by putting a small piece of tap on the top of the mirror creating a little lift for it to open it more easily.</li>
            <li> I think the little kit itself is adorable, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for any guy looking to buy a cool present for a young girl.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy and apologized for getting angry.</li>
            <li> nearly everything you need is in this kit and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It was very neatly packed and arrived early.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I love the long lasting wear they provide!</li>
            <li> Normally &amp;#34;set&amp;#34</li>
            <li> not bad but not great :)</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but breaks off easily got the kit with a few broken colors also the brushes are not strong they break easily but other than that got great colors and the colors last</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that since it is not shipped directly from Amazon you can&#x27;t request a replacement, you can only get an standard refund after they get the returned package, so my credit card wont be credited for several days, I honestly don&#x27;t mind getting a refund instead of a replacement since their quality control appears lacking.</li>
            <li> had it been in new condition</li>
            <li> I wanted new makeup for my birthday.</li>
            <li> whatever)said that they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Today the new shadow kit arrived.</li>
            <li> I look forward to going out and putting on a new color with my outfits.</li>
            <li> Will return it and see if the new one matches uo</li>
            <li> new.</li>
            <li> no doubt it&#x27;s in best condition,nothing is broken or missing...</li>
            <li> Again this goes with them being VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old LOVES this!</li>
            <li> but since she has medium to dark skin, she has to put on a light coat, or it&#x27;ll look chalky.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Just received this today and it was a gift for my daughter, one color of blush is completely gone like it was used as well as two of the eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> The only explanation for it not being being there is that it was NEVER there in the first place.</li>
            <li> The collection of colors and different types of use is giving a wide range of selections, and also when combining the colors, they give a nice impression, my wife said she recommend it to every girl and women equally.</li>
            <li> depth I wanted and faded and brushed off easily when applied dry</li>
            <li> Despite all that, I really just wanted a nicer variety of eyeshadows without having to dish out the big bucks for some high end make up</li>
            <li> The colors last for a long time (I use primer), and they are super rich and don&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
            <li> they are all really drab and dark and mostly lighter and darker versions of the same colors, plus when I first opened the package, 3 of the eyeshadows were completely crushed and all over the place.</li>
            <li> The round color can removed easily from the box ..</li>
            <li> What seemed neat to me was the way that this kit folded open to reveal three trays full of different colors of......ummm.....stuff?  </li>
            <li> As the other reviews said, I was hoping to be a lucky one and get an item that looks like new but guess what?</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because apon recieving this the box was already broken however I love this eyeshadow and all the color choices!</li>
            <li> With so many positive reviews I chanced purchasing this hoping that this one would be one that wasn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li> She only uses certain colors.  </li>
            <li> The case has every color you should ever need from lights to darks from browns to yellows, it really has allot in a little box,the box is little and tucks out of the way nicely.</li>
            <li> The pop-up mirror was definitely one her favorite little kinks.</li>
            <li> but when you open it up you have so much to work with.</li>
            <li> Now my 7 and 8 yr old kids play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> turns out the whole back was cracked.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Shany Cosmetics 32 professional brush kit</li>
            <li> 13 year old and 16 year old</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 9 year old godchild who is just beginning to have an interest in girly stuff.  </li>
            <li> After that I was completely upset because I&#x27;d already ordered it</li>
            <li> also, shadows are EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li> I may end up giving it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li> got it for my 8 year old cousin and she loves it.</li>
            <li> When you open It you cant believe how much product you get.</li>
            <li> Like completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> My Shany Product arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> Every time I see big makeup sets like this, I am very worried about the quality.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys using it daily.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 16 year old cousin.  </li>
            <li> once I saw how much was actually inside!  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li> When i open this up I have so much to choose from.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002DOO1VA SHANY Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li> All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]][[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li> So much so that I&#x27;d rather take a loss than deal with the company and try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 6 year old daughter</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 9 years old.  </li>
            <li> This kit contains everything you need to complete a look.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> but it was worth every penny I spent for it</li>
            <li> Sorry this item had the blush destroyed wasnt packed good .</li>
            <li> I would not recommend you purchase the product, and sadly it may turn out to be a good product.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I have not looked beyond that to see if anything else is broken.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i saw the little box with the Shany trademark on it, but that excitement flew out the window as soon as i took it out the box.</li>
            <li> there is no protective cover on the cells and when the box is closed the cells will be on top of each other.  </li>
            <li> design is DEFINITELY cute however, I wish it came with protective covering so it wouldn&#x27;t spill onto the other colors when it&#x27;s closed.</li>
            <li> We kept finding more and more stuff behind each little layer!  </li>
            <li> Shany is just as good (if not better) as the high end makeup brands, but ordinary people can afford them.</li>
            <li> I do not have super large fingers and find it hard to get my fingers into the provided lift</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that they are mostly blues and golds and mostly muted tones.</li>
            <li> Mine came in decent condition - only one pigment broke on its way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it has many colors.. whoever buys this will NOT be disappointed. ..</li>
            <li> Never again will I spend more money then necessary on \\&quot;high- end\\&quot; products when this is just the same if not better then them.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I immediately opened it and was pleasantly surprised that every single eyeshadow was in place and not broken.</li>
            <li> At first, my goddaughter thought that it was just the two sides that display when you first open, but I remembered that there were supposed to be several different trays, so we started pushing and pulling on the thing until all of a sudden a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; tray on each side slid open.  </li>
            <li> The powder comes up easily instead of being hard (which is a plus), and It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I RETURNED THIS ITEM TWICE, AND THE THIRD ONE I RECEIVED WAS IN NEW CONDITION</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asking for an exchange, hope the second one sent will be in new condition.</li>
            <li> Just be aware because you might have a few broken eyeshadows other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> but the colors aren&#x27;t as bright as it shows and I found them to be hard to get dark enough</li>
            <li> Honestly I was expecting a few of them to be a little broken up but was ok w/that.</li>
            <li> But the only problem was that my shiny white was broken ;( Other then that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL BUT DURABLE, EASY TO CARRY WITH YOU</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how shimmery the eyeshadow is because it makes me feel like I can only wear it for special occasions instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> I can see the validity of the craftsmanship being sub par as the trays do completely slide out, but you can put them back no problem.</li>
            <li> we will be seeing you again in the near future..</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 was the hinge on the box was broke when I got it out of the box  but superglue fixed that</li>
            <li> Upon arriving I found the only issue was the hot pink blush</li>
            <li> and I can see too many broken peices in the box.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> Came partially broken, but mostly intact.</li>
            <li> Many of the powders were dislodged, broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> I was not happy, I thought I was going to be satisfied</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that each color has a small pot so when you find a favorite, you&#x27;ll have a limited amount.  </li>
            <li> Every single piece is highly pigmented and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> Mine last long and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> I had to gently blow out the color dust as it was resting on the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> We buy 75% of all our goods on Amazon and this is a rare and huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My brother and his wife bought me this for my birthday last year and when I got it the case was broken along with most of the make up in the case.</li>
            <li> Go spend the extra few dollars and get something worth it.</li>
            <li> When she came back I found that many the blush is damaged and broken.</li>
            <li> This little box has so much to offer!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing this item at first.</li>
            <li> Not long wearing tho.</li>
            <li> The mirror broke off within the first few weeks</li>
            <li> Im not sure its worth this price.</li>
            <li> , the two palettes underneath do not slide out very easily and some of the individual colors  are loose and contributes to the case not sliding properly which can be frustrating to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lip colors are super sheer and unnoticeable and they dry out after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow colors were a little repetitive , would have like to have more lip selections or bigger sample sizes.</li>
            <li> The style of it just drives me crazy how cute it is!</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine, nothing was broken at all.</li>
            <li> there was so much in this tiny little box.  </li>
            <li> This is so much make up for such a little price.  </li>
            <li> The clear sticker to keep the side closed looked like someone had already opened it,</li>
            <li> I have not used the lipgloss included, it&#x27;s totally unappealing to me and the blush looks kind of trashy against my pale skin.</li>
            <li> The blushes are super pigmented (not a good thing), but overall this is essential</li>
            <li> The product was nicely wrapped and only one of the shades were broken off, which I expected after reading other people reviews.</li>
            <li> I didnt order directly from amazon but from their website, i bought this and 3 other pallets and brushes....</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> Very practical, and nothing else is necessary, just this small box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He generally gives me my gifts a few weeks early (I have no clue why</li>
            <li> The item was indeed new and sealed but as soon as I opened it, it was a mess.</li>
            <li> i got it and it was safely packaged but one of the eyeshadow applicators was broken in half and a pointy plastic tip seemed to be stuck in one of the eyeshadow palletes.</li>
            <li> When I received my order, I was so excited to open it, but found few cells cracked/broken and the colors got on other cells and it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> the lip glosses aren&#x27;t really long lasting, and move around like jello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have found them a long time ago.</li>
            <li> long lasting beutiful pigments aand wonderfull shimmer</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it came wrapped well, a few eyeshadows were cracked, but mostly, all it was was dusty.</li>
            <li> i mean really who send out makeup in a package that doesn&#x27;t have enough protection for the product</li>
            <li> As a black woman, with dark brown skin, it shows up very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> This gift was provided to a teen-ager whose parents were not able to provide Christmas gifts for their children due to disability and large medical bills!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase other Shany cosmetics products in the future.</li>
            <li> Also felt a little flimsy as far as the casing.     </li>
            <li> so they looked a little wild on me.</li>
            <li> AND THEY TAKE SO LONG  FOR A REFUND&lt;</li>
            <li> This product goes along way and has lasted me a long long time.</li>
            <li> Am returning for the 120 palette for roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> NOT PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> I like how you have a wide variety of make up to choose from and can wear a different shade</li>
            <li> I wanted pink, purple, blue etc. -_______________________-</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but has LOTS of colors.</li>
            <li> bought this for my fifteen year old sister and she uses this everyday...</li>
            <li> you never know how long deals like this will be around!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have two minor complaints,which is that the shadow gets powdery so closing this</li>
            <li> The packagers need to cater for long trips, there is no protective shield on anything, allowing the colors to spill everywhere..</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected but still lots of color options to choose from.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are definitely going to need some kind of base and finish spray to make these last longer than MAYBE an hour.</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews and noticed others had the broken pieces problem, but also there was some very positive reviews</li>
            <li> My friend just bought a similar kit at Sephora for almost double what this kit costs with less in it.  </li>
            <li> That cause a big problem because it is not stable will leave a big mess</li>
            <li> , the only downside I could possibly have is that there aren&#x27;t any matte shadows, it isn&#x27;t enough of a complaint to make a big deal out of this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients used in this product; seem to be low quality compared to other products.</li>
            <li> she tried to open the case and the other hinge broke.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it should be that difficult, or costly to package a little better...</li>
            <li> The lip stick things rub off if you&#x27;re eating and dry after about an hour.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because a few a the colors fell out, but I just put them back in.</li>
            <li> My younger sisters birthday was a few weeks back</li>
            <li> All over the other colors and all over the palets and box, I was crushed cuz it was a gorgeous color I would have used often :(</li>
            <li> A couple of the eye shadows were broken and made a mess during shipping but nothing you couldn&#x27;t easily clean up.</li>
            <li> It is also the wrong one apparently and its mainly \\&quot;brown-ish\\&quot; gross colors!</li>
            <li> Every single time I use this is makes me excitied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she uses it every single morning.</li>
            <li> Not worth the 30 bucks overall.</li>
            <li> Got the first one and the hinge was broken.</li>
            <li> She has been using it everyday and has barely put a dent in it.</li>
            <li> Some of the eye shadow became loose or they broke from the molds.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was out of place and that&#x27;s just because they are only taped down.</li>
            <li> Includes brushes which is a big help - one less thing to purchase.</li>
            <li> so I leave it half way open in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> The 2nd time half the make up was busted and all over the place.</li>
            <li> No need to spend an arm and leg on super expensive shadows anymore.</li>
            <li> Got the product and it was such a mess</li>
            <li> , it was a mess, this was supposed to be a birthday present</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit smaller</li>
            <li> You only get a little of each color.  </li>
            <li> I got natural dull colors like brown, tan and BS.</li>
            <li> Was a little smaller than I expected but not much...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy and very disappointed when I opened the package and saw the make-up was cracked!</li>
            <li> This kit is made for the experimenter with a wide variety of shades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Looks like I spent a fortune.</li>
            <li> it has every eyeshadow colors and is too wide</li>
            <li> like I spent $70 instead of $40.</li>
            <li> Want to play with color and have a wide range of color at an affordable price?</li>
            <li> Only one piece was missing...</li>
            <li> Three blue eye shadows were broken and blue dust covered the entire package.  </li>
            <li> When I got the makeup it was broken and the make up is really hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But when I closed it and reopened it makeup was ever I would not recommend this to anyone or any of their products</li>
            <li> but i did&#x27;nt find any pink eyeshadow in this kit...there are some pink eyeshadows</li>
            <li> wide range of colors allow for mixing and blending.</li>
            <li> The box is not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> .. I really wan my money back</li>
            <li> When I pulled the makeup kit out, there were broken eyeshadows and the kit was completely snapped in two!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like that the blush compartment was broken, so there was hot pink mess when I opened it.</li>
            <li> It was one big MESS!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Even though product looks good but due to the broken peices as a result of bad packaging or bad shipping, I can not give more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> round 100 wet 76 dry eye color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One of the eyeliner/shadows was sprinkled all over everything like baby powder due to shipping.</li>
            <li> Other than that I heard a lot of grumbles about the shades and colors and quality.  </li>
            <li> and i could not return due to</li>
            <li> The brushes that come with kit aren&#x27;t what I use, but other than that it is great....not the lipgloss though.</li>
            <li> Also I did not have any allergic reaction  like for example with other brands.</li>
            <li> However, I have purchased other products from Shany Cosmetics before</li>
            <li> I gave this item 2 stars due to shipping challenges.  </li>
            <li> I would be inclined to order other items from Shany...</li>
            <li> all the way eventually the shadows will get bits of them  stuck into each other</li>
            <li> I got it and was so excited but lots of the squares of makeup were broken and smeared everywhere!!</li>
            <li> it the set has endless colors</li>
            <li> case is quite unique and closes up, almost looking like a little shopping bad with its red rope handles.  </li>
            <li> but then the new one we received had 2 of the eye shadows completely broken out</li>
            <li> Tried it again and the second one the same thing the hinge was broken.</li>
            <li> Case compartments hard to open.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is hard to open.</li>
            <li> but there is a little thing that i am missing alot and its pink eyeshadow,actually i am pink lover</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> Since it was a lightning deal I will just be minus an eye shadow and explain why it is missing to the receiver.</li>
            <li> i was surprised that it was broken, because it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife because she likes pink eye shadows, and it looked like it had quite a few pinks.</li>
            <li> make up that is running down your face..</li>
            <li> the looks you&#x27;ll create are endless!</li>
            <li> Product received cracked and some make up powder all over other parts of case!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, that was good, but like a few others, mine was broken :(</li>
            <li> I noticed some other reviews mention broken cells; the one I recieved was wrapped in several extra thick layers of bubble wrap, and all cells were intact.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slightly indented spot that blends in with the black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had cracked slightly and spread some dust around the blush compartment.</li>
            <li> the middle pink blush was broken, and pieces of eyeshadow were stuck in the lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the inside box ( black box )</li>
            <li> It was an impulse buy because of the half off price at xmas time.</li>
            <li> I guess it a decent kit for the price but be wary of the packaging.</li>
            <li> a little let down but</li>
            <li> cause you&#x27;ll make a mess.</li>
            <li> The brushes were low-quality and the hairs of the brush fell apart and created a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year and a half</li>
            <li> Meh...not wat I expected,  the colors are not pigmented,  very few of them are, you wud think they&#x27;re from the picture, but they feel like freaking wax</li>
            <li> The only down side to the kit is our kit was broken in half when we received it</li>
            <li> My daughter is willing to salvage what is left, but as the purchaser, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of shipping and lack of proper packaging for a mailorder item.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it came with so little</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little square and all over the rest of the things in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had it as did all the little eyeshadow brushes it included.</li>
            <li> a little too shiny/sparkly for my taste</li>
            <li> When I opened the box the little cakes were cracked and some had fallen out and gotten all over the place.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, the cells are fairly small and messy.</li>
            <li> For anyone who gets confused and frustrated buying makeup, this makes the process quick and painless, and you end up with all of the colors you could possibly need for night or day.</li>
            <li> One eye shadow was totally missing out of the little circle areas, the blush was so crunched up and all over.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy to see that it was NOT only poorly packaged but honestly, it was so poorly packaged</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m disappointed because I brought this specially for the lipstick and my order came without it.</li>
            <li> One color came broken probably bc of bad shipping handling but didn&#x27;t mind because it was easily replaced with the other dozens it has.</li>
            <li> I received this case with one of the eye shadows missing.</li>
            <li> a few things they could have put with is would be</li>
            <li> a few liners lip glosses an maybe a mascara</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were even missing.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the hinge broken but the eye shadow was all over.</li>
            <li> The case being broken is a big deal since it folds up</li>
            <li> was going to replace it a 3rd time and decided to mix match from the broken cases to make a completed set.</li>
            <li> So the only problem is the broken brushes</li>
            <li> make-up was broken in tiny liltle pices.</li>
            <li> I like it because I use make up a lot everyday.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because when my package arrived one of the eye shadows was broken and part of the tray would not open because the applicators got stuck under the slider.</li>
            <li> I hate it, cheap quality,  </li>
            <li> Also the sponge applicators are a waste.</li>
            <li> So OBVIOUSLY the thing was broken.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There was a problem when shiped to me one of the eye shadows were broken and was everywhere NO BIG DEAL TO ME.</li>
            <li> Also one of the double sided eyeshadow brushes was completely broken.</li>
            <li> were also broken so they do not slide in properly.  </li>
            <li> Colors are cake, and some arrive broken, or mixed in with the rest.</li>
            <li> The second blush ( the pretties of them all) was broken and had gotten everywhere...</li>
            <li> The kit was broken in the middle.</li>
            <li> When used you basically get a pale coloured shiny</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL with this as it would not be hard to break the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might get it back in worst conditions or it might take a long time to get my refund, not very happy right now</li>
            <li> but when i got it in the box was broken which is the 2nd time i order it &amp; both time they come in broken but other than improving their package.</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed, but  was okay with returning it and trying again for an undamaged package.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and I fully expected to be disappointed when the product arrived.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken, the box was dirty, several powders had been used, a brush was missing and a second brush had been used.  </li>
            <li> For a gift, the package seems small.</li>
            <li> However, I can tell you that this is a slick kit.  </li>
            <li> It was covered in bubble wrap that might have been a few layers thick</li>
            <li> It comes in a small convenient case for travel and it has two scraps to carry it around.</li>
            <li> Im not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used it everyday since it arrived and hasn&#x27;t had a complaint yet.</li>
            <li> is totally missing!</li>
            <li> but wen I recibe this product its toooo small.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations at all, product is extremely small for the price and beside that the product came damage</li>
            <li> it all sits in a big case and is unlikely to break</li>
            <li> acting silly.</li>
            <li> The kit had several broken makeup cells and the powder was everywhere, rendered some of the other items useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with what I received it was a mess, package was broken in half, colors were not protected one of the cells lost its color</li>
            <li> My kit was broken like some of other reviews.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I got mad and stormed off.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that one of my eyeshadow&#x27;s was completely broken up which contaminated the other colors.</li>
            <li> and the other did not not happy at all</li>
            <li> I expected it to be messy and all broken up due to the handling that it would have to endure before it got to me; and I must say that I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dusty and just kind of disgusting.</li>
            <li> I received it broken in half</li>
            <li> Mine showed up today broken in half.  </li>
            <li> the colors were dull.  </li>
            <li> The lip brushes are hard and don&#x27;t work I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> It was very small, and one of the colors was broken and got all over the other colors and lipgloss!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews where it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little set, however there were two broken eyeshadows which, upon opening, got into the lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I was expecting at least like 2 or 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> A negative about this product is that after dropping it on the counter from just a couple inches the hinges on the case broke.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about their make-up.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the case broke when opening it about a month after my daughter had it so its awkward to put away now.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was disappointing when I opened the box and saw an even smaller box inside.</li>
            <li> and I was not PLEASED at all, it was broken and some makeup had spilled out.....and the case so small what&#x27;s up with that</li>
            <li> one of the hinges was broken,  then when I opened it all the way there was one missing circle eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I like that the lip gloss isn&#x27;t thick like some kits I&#x27;ve gotten before.</li>
            <li> I hate this product, all the colors were on each other, few boxes were empty.</li>
            <li> the spring that lets the box open and close is broken!!</li>
            <li> After pulling away layers upon layers of bubble wrap, I noticed that the box was a bit powdery and when I opened it ONE OF DA SHADOWS WAS MISSING!!</li>
            <li> Also, 2 of the small brushes were broken and some of the eyeshadow was smudged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s impossible, &#x27;cause no woman carry only one thing inside her bag.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that bad but looked a lot bigger in the picture</li>
            <li> only bad thing about this item.</li>
            <li> Overall bad product, but the shiny eyeshadows(not</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are definitely not of good quality, and appear quite cakey when applied.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, so I don&#x27;t know anything about makeup, so I am not a good person to review the quality of the makeup in this kit.  </li>
            <li> , I have noticed after having this product for about a week that it can be very hard to get the hinged mirror up to get to the blushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing was broken and everything was in place</li>
            <li> but when I got it alot of it was broken.</li>
            <li> there were some broken eye-shadows but still can use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> poorly made.</li>
            <li> but as for it being broken when i received it</li>
            <li> The case is broken, and two of the eye-shadows are broken.  </li>
            <li> one of the eyeshadow&#x27;s color was broken ...</li>
            <li> I just wished it wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Not a Happy customer</li>
            <li> Had to return it 2x because the case was broken and  then the makeup was broken.</li>
            <li> Yes the brushes inside may be broken but the makeup still works.</li>
            <li> All the maik up whas broken and the aya shedows all over the box</li>
            <li> but we got this as a gift for someone, and when they opened it, one of the hinges was broken.  </li>
            <li> The hinge was broken, eye shadow and blush was broken and every where.</li>
            <li> The case was broken,AND the shadow was broken.</li>
            <li> I think it may be broken.</li>
            <li> If it had broken on the way I could have blamed UPS but the damn thing was defective from the start.</li>
            <li> I was not happy when I received this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing that my friend finds annoying about it is that sometimes it feels like the case is going to fall apart</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken</li>
            <li> Case was broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> Hinges were broken so it was in 2 pieces and the slide out trays</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll write another review later when I combine the shadows with my shadow base primer.</li>
            <li> I was worried about having this product shipped because of all the reviews in which people had broken palettes.</li>
            <li> was broken.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on how theirs was broken when they got it etc.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken - not just the makeup but the case itself.  </li>
            <li> It got here today and 3 of the colors are cracked and broken and 1</li>
            <li> She found that the case was broken.</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice and returned twice... shipped and package broken....</li>
            <li> the box wasn&#x27;t damaged but the make up hinge was broken before packaged.</li>
            <li> I believe I had 3-4 eye shadows that were broken all over, and the case is broken, again, like others.  </li>
            <li> Came with a broken drawer and 2 of the makeup squares were messed up like someone already opened it.</li>
            <li> nothing was out of place or broken</li>
            <li> The product came into its box, and was broken.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time but contents were broken.  </li>
            <li> a lot of them said they received broken cases or broken makeup pieces</li>
            <li> I received a broken package.</li>
            <li> My kit arrived with poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any broken eye shadows or anything.</li>
            <li> The hinge is broken when receive</li>
            <li> and one cell was broken everywhere.</li>
            <li> item is so badly designed that it can&#x27;t be flipped upside down</li>
            <li> Youll have a very dirty face from the amount of loose</li>
            <li> so I took a chance, bad luck, got a messy kit.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy it because I saw some negative experiences with some customers.</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed with the lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Well when I received my package in the mail I was a little disappointed that the colors advertised was nothing like the ones I received.</li>
            <li> When I used it I had an allergic reaction to it which is weird for me</li>
            <li> I hope I got a wrong and defective product.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy expensive products again.</li>
            <li> the makeup is not crappy and you cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> One of the applicators is also broken!</li>
            <li> I had read that othr people had problems with this item such as broken shadows, but this item was dirty and disgusting.</li>
            <li> shadow.&lt;br /&gt;The applicators and the \\&quot;lip stick\\&quot; are laughable.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical when I ordered this</li>
            <li> Since this was a gift shipped elsewhere it will be a difficult return.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I was unable to use the colors.</li>
            <li> The makeup case was very poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was very disappointed to see how the little sliders were broken and so were the colors.</li>
            <li> Bad and its broken dont buy</li>
            <li> but when I received this package, it wasnt intact and about 3 of the colors were broken and they were all over the box :(</li>
            <li> and it was dirty from the broke makeup.</li>
            <li> Really unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> , I will keep the product I&#x27;m afraid if I return it</li>
            <li> The thing I found to be disappointing were the colors.</li>
            <li> It was dirty inside with finger marks and makeup rests.</li>
            <li> but no, I just received it today and it was all broken (not the makeup but the base where the makeup is)</li>
            <li> Is the hinges on the case are VERY WEAK!</li>
            <li> I hated the makeup is was so small and the color was ugly</li>
            <li> when i opened my package 3 of the colors were broken all and all over the box!!</li>
            <li> Fake !</li>
            <li> Blush is horrible, and the small brushes included don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> I was frustrated that the seller, or whoever packed it didn&#x27;t even bother to protect the product inside the box.</li>
            <li> Frustrated...</li>
            <li> what I received is completely ugly.</li>

            <li> Would not order this again.  :(</li>

            <li> The colors are not what is diplayed.... and some of the eye shadow have finger marks... and the case is flimsy and dirty very disappointed</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP  </li>
            <li> but I hear no grumbles about it at all and would recommend it to save grief.</li>
            <li> No problem, but a tad annoying</li>
            <li> and I hate it.)</li>
            <li> Viene completamente con muchos colores de sombras, labial y rubor, me encantan los colores brillantes y de base, son genial</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are all FREAKISHLY sparkly and annoying.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought it for a Christmas gift, my sister loved it. It&#x27;s a little bit smaller then I thought it was gonna be but still has tons of makeup in it.</li>
            <li> Five stars on the shipping and look of the item&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly as shown and the colors look fabulous I don&#x27;t know why I expected it to be bigger but its compact and a good size .&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was broken and everything was in place it&#x27;s so cute ik my mother will love this when she opens it on Christmas</li>
            <li> the colors in the picture were nothing like the colors in the box when I recieved it... My daughter liked it ok but not as much as we thought we would... I am very disappointed with the differences</li>
            <li> Fun with Make up&lt;br /&gt;bought this for my daughter.  She loves it&lt;br /&gt;she says the colors are mostly useable.&lt;br /&gt;it was nice on her face and not harsh like some color packs can be&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> simply fabulous! colors are gorgeous and really give off a sparkling shimmer to the eyes! fantastic product!</li>
            <li> My brother and his wife bought me this for my birthday last year and when I got it the case was broken along with most of the make up in the case. When I finally got it cleaned up to where it was usable. When I used it I had an allergic reaction to it which is weird for me I&#x27;m not allergic to any sort of cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP  AND THEY TAKE SO LONG  FOR A REFUND&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS ALL MASHE UP ALL INSIDE THE BOX WAS BREAK , THE MAKE UP ITS NICE BUT THE SHIPMENT ITS AWFUL</li>
            <li> I chose this set for the vibrance and variety of colors shown on the photograph. I am disappointed that they are mostly blues and golds and mostly muted tones.</li>
            <li> G&#x27;daughter loves this thing!</li>
            <li> Lots of great colors. Great product as well</li>
            <li> This product goes everywhere I go. Everything I need is in one package. My daughters and I travel alot and this is so convenient. All my outfits are accompanied by the beautiful colors of this make up kit. This product goes along way and has lasted me a long long time. If you are wondering if you need it. Dont think twice...this is another must have Shany product!</li>
            <li> For $36 you will get all of this colors and the colors are great, I cannot even believe it. Try and get this palette.</li>
            <li> This little box has so much to offer! So many shades from neutrals to vibrant colors all that make your eyes pop! You get an array of cool and warm tones which can compliment any eye color. The blushes and eye shadows are very pigmented. I love the peach blush since it suits my complexion. The lip glosses are ok, I use it for more of a lip tint since it gives my lips a dash of color. My package came in great condition, none of my eye shadows or blushes were cracked nor the mirror. This is way better than having a make-up bag filled with individual shadows, blushes, glosses, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit for the everyday women or even makeup artists. The name does this product justice! This is all you need.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest kit! High-end, high quality packaging, rich and brightly pigmented colors. This totally would make a great gift. Create some of the hottest makeup trends around with this palette. Create the smokey eye look, the classic eye look, the neutral eye look, etc. With eye shadows, blushes &amp; lip gloss colors the looks you&#x27;ll create are endless! A makeup lover&#x27;s dream! And what a great gift to give or receive for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This i basically like using the palettes from Bh cosmetics or coastal scents.! So its a good go to item for beginners.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product has so many good reviews.  I hope I got a wrong and defective product.  Although they are many colors to choose from, please be advised that they are tiny cells.  there is no protective cover on the cells and when the box is closed the cells will be on top of each other.  When I received my order, I was so excited to open it, but found few cells cracked/broken and the colors got on other cells and it was a mess.  I returned the product and I am hoping that I will get a refund.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of great colors and products..bouggt for my teenager.she loves it</li>
            <li> Can use it over and over.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago and it just yesterday broke on me when I bought it I paid 25$ and I love it but the colors aren&#x27;t as bright as it shows and I found them to be hard to get dark enough but I do love it!</li>
            <li> good, my sister love it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that bad but looked a lot bigger in the picture</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeeee this product! its really cute and it came in bubble wrap so every color was in perfect condition!! i lovee amazon!</li>
            <li> great for the teenager that I bought it for .</li>
            <li> this kid is excellent, variety color eyeshadow in this kid and good price.</li>
            <li> The make-up goes on good but when I got it alot of it was broken. Good prices in the make-up.</li>
            <li> When I received my package all the makeup was out of place and all over the box. I was real disappointed I couldn&#x27;t even use any of the shadows.</li>
            <li> I should say that this item is a real deal. all in one and I love the color combination. Thanks,</li>
            <li> My friend just bought a similar kit at Sephora for almost double what this kit costs with less in it.  It&#x27;s my travel kit - no need to pack every product that I own which always ends up getting lost!</li>
            <li> This will make the perfect gift for the makeup lover. Just be aware because you might have a few broken eyeshadows other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product. You get a great range of colors to choose from and all are highly pigmented. You have everything you need to create almost any look you can possibly imagine and at such a great price too. Purchase this with the 13 peice brush set and you have everything you would need as a beginner to launch your collection and have everything you need to venture out into the makeup world.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.She absolutely loves it. The case comes with many colors for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this as a christmas present and when I opened it one of the hooks holding the two squares together broke. After I opended it a couple times both of the sliding parts came out of place. The matte eye shadows are decent and the shimmery ones are pretty good. I guess it a decent kit for the price but be wary of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This beautiful set of eyeshadows and blushes gives you variety of colors in such small and unique packaging  The Cube looks like a chocolate box   I have had it for over a year now and no complaints   Had it with me on a trip to vegas and my girls just were amazed by its quality   It has both shimmer and matt veriety of colors   easy to carry and pack saving you space and time   thumbs up for this good deal  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I struggle with trying to get a quality palette that&#x27;s pigmented. But when I came across this it is wonderful and you have a variety to choose from witch is always a bargain. The style of it just drives me crazy how cute it is!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality! I have medium toned skin and am always scouting for highly pigmented shades, whether it&#x27;s eye/lip/cheek colors. I was introduced to Shany by a friend and have been using this line ever since! The colors also dont irrirate my sensiitive skin and stay all day, without making me break out - definitely great value for money and a lot if fun !!!</li>
            <li> Ok, this product is great! The colors are truly beautiful! The packaging was fine, nothing was broken at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because a few a the colors fell out, but I just put them back in. Also, it came with no brushes at all. I was expecting at least like 2 or 3 brushes. Over all, I loved this product, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> For anyone who gets confused and frustrated buying makeup, this makes the process quick and painless, and you end up with all of the colors you could possibly need for night or day. Easy to take along when traveling and you never have to worry about forgetting things. Love the colors and the makeup is good quality. Don&#x27;t need brand name products for big $$$ when I can just buy this kit.</li>
            <li> Got the product and it was such a mess I can&#x27;t say I like it or not. Got some others and the colors were nice there were some broken eye-shadows but still can use them.&lt;br /&gt;Please, Shany Cosmetics, if you read this, do something about your packaging!</li>
            <li> Very nice kit, with great selection. These are also nice and easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like that the blush compartment was broken, so there was hot pink mess when I opened it. Other wise all the powders were in tact.</li>
            <li> The kit had several broken makeup cells and the powder was everywhere, rendered some of the other items useless. The size is much smaller than anticipated but that would have been ok if the kit had arrived in good shape. I did read the reviews and noticed others had the broken pieces problem, but also there was some very positive reviews so I took a chance, bad luck, got a messy kit. I ordered this for my daughter who is in modeling school and she really needs it so I will just buy her some makeup locally from a reliable source. Another thing is that since it is not shipped directly from Amazon you can&#x27;t request a replacement, you can only get an standard refund after they get the returned package, so my credit card wont be credited for several days, I honestly don&#x27;t mind getting a refund instead of a replacement since their quality control appears lacking. I will look elsewhere for makeup next time.</li>
            <li> My Daughter is a Cosmetologist and uses this on her Clients.&lt;br /&gt;All her Clients are very impressed with it as well as myself and my Daughter.&lt;br /&gt;The No Animal Testing IS just one of the best things about this Product.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the makeup kit I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a good buy, only because I have brought plenty of make-up over the years and they don&#x27;t seem to show up on my carmel colored skin. To my surprise each color showed up as brightly as it looked on the palette. I played around with mixing and matching many of the colors and they all came out looking glamorious. I also enjoyed how compact it was it did not take up to much space in my bathroom and I had no problem packing it up when I was on the go. It seemed like it came with so little but when you open it up you have so much to work with. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> excellent!!! i would love to have this at home. my cousin has one and every time we are getting ready to go out she take it with her. it is very handy and very convenient. i am ordering mine now.</li>
            <li> this has so many colors and diffrent types of makeup. it is a perfct gift for someone who is just now getting into makeup! great price for what you are getting</li>
            <li> The quality of the eye shadow and blush is very good. It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily. There are so many colors to choose from so you can get creative. A negative about this product is that after dropping it on the counter from just a couple inches the hinges on the case broke.</li>
            <li> A gift for my niece--she loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas, I was optimistic after reading the reviews on amazon.  Being a man I know nothing about make-up, however; I do know that if you order anything it should not be knocked out of it&#x27;s little square and all over the rest of the things in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the eyeliner/shadows was sprinkled all over everything like baby powder due to shipping. Other than that I heard a lot of grumbles about the shades and colors and quality.  Now my 7 and 8 yr old kids play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I had to order another set (Estee Lauder 2013 Blockbuster Set) from a different supplier that was close to triple the price of this one, but I hear no grumbles about it at all and would recommend it to save grief.</li>
            <li> Sorry this item had the blush destroyed wasnt packed good . I really loved the eye shadows but the blush was not in a good condition</li>
            <li> i loved how compact and pretty it looked when i opened it. I also love how you can carry it and how it also comes with a mirror.</li>
            <li> I have used shany eye shadow and blush before and I can tell you that it is a good product. Mine last long and the colors are vibrant. There is nothing negative I can say about their make-up. It&#x27;s excellently priced and yet you do not sacrifice quality.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2IPHSJXJNTVJP]]If you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  If you think the price is right, it is.  The case, which is a compact 5 3/4\\&quot; (L) x 6\\&quot; (W) x 2 1/2\\&quot; (D), belies how many colors are tucked inside.  Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is quite unique and closes up, almost looking like a little shopping bad with its red rope handles.  You can hang the case, stow it in a drawer, or tote it along with you.  Take care to hold it upright as intended because when I didn&#x27;t a couple of the drawers slid open.  No problem, but a tad annoying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âº  98 shimmer eye shadows; 70 pastel shimmer eye shadows or gloss eye shadows; 6 lip glosses; 3 Blush&lt;br /&gt;âº  2 lip brushes, 7 double sided eyeshadow applicators; one blush brush; 1 mirror&lt;br /&gt;âº  Compact folding case with purse straps, gift set style&lt;br /&gt;âº  Designed in USA and manufactured in a factory which makes high end cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are pigmented and a bit shimmery.  This kit is made for the experimenter with a wide variety of shades.  There aren&#x27;t any extremes here (no black), but rather a great variety for anyone to work with.  You can wear them along or layer to create your own unique look.  When you pop open the layers of this case, simply use your fingernail to push them open.  There&#x27;s a slightly indented spot that blends in with the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  The applicators can be replaced by ones of your choosing.  Most people tend to do this as they have their favorites.  There&#x27;s a small mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  When the layers of eyeshadow slide open, there&#x27;s sufficient room so the layers don&#x27;t hit one another. Nice value and if you like variety this may be a palette you&#x27;d like to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.this may be a palette you&#x27;d like to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing for a teen or preteen who loves makeup.  It&#x27;s compact and has just about everything a girl needs.  Even if you are not a teen and want to experiment with color this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Case compartments hard to open.  poorly made. the colors were dull.  the shadows crack with the slightest bump of case.  smaller than i thought.</li>
            <li> I love it.... it&#x27;s beautiful.....recommended.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old LOVES this! It arrived well packaged and in great shape. The box is easy for her to drag around the house and it has been many hours of fun for her.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome gift idea.  you get a lot for your money.  My sister absolutely love this.  Worked perfect had no issues at all with order. arrived in time for her birthday!</li>
            <li> After looking at this over and over, I did get the whole kit for niece. She LOVED it. Must admit the colors looked gorgeous. :-)  very nice colors look like like a hint of shimmer, I thought I did pretty well with this one. Very happy I purchased!</li>
            <li> Great variety of color but the case falls apart really easy.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Best for kids to use as play make up. Purchased for my teen and even she won&#x27;t wear any of these overly metallic shades.</li>
            <li> I received this case with one of the eye shadows missing. SHANY would only let me return it for a refund and would not replace it.  Since it was a lightning deal I will just be minus an eye shadow and explain why it is missing to the receiver. This is about quality control and the eye shadow didn&#x27;t fall out of the case, because it was never put into the case. As far as the quality of the make-up, I really don&#x27;t know, but if missing some of it is any indication, then probably not that great.</li>
            <li> A good buy for your money</li>
            <li> this product is great not words it basically has pretty much all you need all the colors you could think of. a few things they could have put with is would be a few liners lip glosses an maybe a mascara then it would have been great but other than that the product is great</li>
            <li> I like this product, this product has a good colors and a pretty good size. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> my wife almost cry when she saw all the colors this make up kit have it fit perfect for her</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is very cool. It contains so many colors and you can mix and match. It&#x27;s perfect from your little dancer to your volleyball girl. It&#x27;s great knowing I am the mother of 2, I greatly appreciate this item.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I had anticipated, but I love how compact it is and am very excited to try all the colors.</li>
            <li> i never liked any type of makeup as much as i loved this eye shadows , im just in love with it , i bought the kit a couple months ago &amp; im very happy with it (: i would def recommend it to anyone ... color lasts for a loooong time</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, came right on time.  Everything was perfect, no cracks or anything wrong with the shadows.  Colors are wonderful and bright, was a great gift for my sister. Her first makeup kit to use as an estatition to practice and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Gift for granddaughter, she loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. For a gift, the package seems small. Am returning for the 120 palette for roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> Great product! i got it and it was safely packaged but one of the eyeshadow applicators was broken in half and a pointy plastic tip seemed to be stuck in one of the eyeshadow palletes. I fixed it by smoothing it over and fixed the applicator with some glue and now everything looks as good as new!. definitely recommend this for anyone who loves make up. makes a great present too!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail, And i did today. But it wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting, I was thinking it would be a bit larger. However the colors all look very pretty, And Ive bought this brand before and know personally there a good quality ( as far as how they go on &amp; stay ), For me i felt like this really was like a mini preview. Also felt a little flimsy as far as the casing.     a little let down but all is well. For the price its a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who goes CRAZY for makeup! She was so excited to get it, and I was happy that everything was of great quality. She says the makeup holds up through the day very nicely and she loves all the colors.</li>
            <li> This makeup goes on really smooth, and looks great for a long time. I would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s much cheaper and more colors to pick from than many big named products. The price is low, but this product is no way cheap.</li>
            <li> I was excited about finding the product.  It looks beautiful online. However, when I received it not so much. You only get a little of each color.  Probably enough for 1-2 uses.  Some of the colors were even missing.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  The price is cheap and so is the product.  Go spend the extra few dollars and get something worth it.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product twice and had to return it twice. Very disappointed. Got the first one and the hinge was broken. Tried it again and the second one the same thing the hinge was broken. Not only was the hinge broken but the eye shadow was all over. Not good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. Color goes on nice and lasts. Quality very good. Looks like I spent a fortune. I will never buy expensive products again. Going to get this for my sister as well. Love it.</li>
            <li> This was an absolutely wonderful buy for my daughter, although she prefers matte over shimmer (there are no matte eyeshadows in this set), she still adores everything... well almost everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the blushes are okay, but since she has medium to dark skin, she has to put on a light coat, or it&#x27;ll look chalky.&lt;br /&gt;and the lip glosses aren&#x27;t really long lasting, and move around like jello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but besides that, this is a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and she absolutely loved it. She tried the make up on and was impressed with the quality. I was a bit impressed as well that I will be ordering myself the same thing. The variety of colors and shades are nice and the case itself is attractive and convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> i was highly disappointed. when i opened my package 3 of the colors were broken all and all over the box!! the spring that lets the box open and close is broken!! the colors are ok i prefer bh cosmetics but i suppose the quality of the eye shadows are satisfactory for the price. but as for it being broken when i received it i will never buy or recommend buying from shany ever again! i mean really who send out makeup in a package that doesn&#x27;t have enough protection for the product your sending? NOT PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend but she seems very happy with this.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:fa977597efe5becdd35f4a2e0f290eea]] This Shany makeup kit has every color imaginable for eye shadow, both cream and pearlized, with several blush and lip gloss colors.  The only drawback is that each color has a small pot so when you find a favorite, you&#x27;ll have a limited amount.  This would make a great gift for anyone who loves makeup, especially for someone who does other people&#x27;s faces, thus using the full range of the palette.  It would be perfect for teenage girl makeup parties or any other occasion when it would be fun to experiment with color.  Watch the video to see how the box unfolds and what it contains.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> This is the perfect all in one gift for someone just getting into make up who needs some help building up their collection. So many colors and products to experiment with; what a great value!</li>
            <li> This kit turned out to be one of my favorites. All you need is this one, compact item and your good to go on trips. The eye shadows are my favorite. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the pigmentation on them for such a low price. So shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li> im in love with this little kit is so adorable and i love the color of it. i would not change anything. this is the same almost of the sephora mini kit but this cost wise is much more pefered.</li>
            <li> hello i recently tried this makeup through my sister and i was amazed at how pretty the colors were,so i decided to buy this kit for myself! cant wait for it to come in the mail so excited!! thanks amazon and shanycosmetics keep up the awesome work!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product May 1, 2012 and finally got it the 16 of May 2012.  The makeup case was very poorly packaged. The case is broken, and two of the eye-shadows are broken.  The case being broken is a big deal since it folds up and now it leaves one side flopping around.  One of the previous reviews says that they need to package their products better.  Since that review was some time ago I figured if they are a good company they will have addressed that and it should be OK now. I was very unhappy to see that it was NOT only poorly packaged but honestly, it was so poorly packaged you can only draw the conclusion that the company doesn&#x27;t care if the product arrives in good condition to you or not.  I wish Amazon would allow me to post photos, (they allow video???), so I will post shortcuts to my Photobucket photos. I would not recommend you purchase the product, and sadly it may turn out to be a good product.  [...]  [...]  [...]</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this!  It was a Christmas gift.  She kept opening and sliding and was quite impressed with how much make up this little box actually holds!</li>
            <li> Some of the makeup was broke. The box the product came in was dented in on the corner. The seal on the box was broke so it had been opened and it was dirty from the broke makeup. I would not recommend you buy this.</li>
            <li> My best friend ordered hers and when I tried it I loved it! Every color pops out and stays on for hours!!!! I went out and fell asleep with it on and woke up with it still on!! Great quality!! I&#x27;m ordering my own!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely their best product yet! The eye shadows are amazing and the blush and lip gloss go very well with any of the eye shadow choices. Shany is just as good (if not better) as the high end makeup brands, but ordinary people can afford them.</li>
            <li> It s perfect it has every eyeshadow colors and is too wide</li>
            <li> This shany all in one harmony is the best buy  of the year. Hands down great make up you get loads of fabulous color and different styles out of this kit. The make up goes on smooth and the colors are phenomenal. If you are a person like me who loves options and style this kit for you all these colors work in harmony to make you the pretest women in the room.you will turn peoples heads day in and out with all the different looks you will get out of this kit. Buy it today and be beauty fabulous .</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from! I loved this. The shadows are a good quality and you can find the perfect shade to any outfit.</li>
            <li> I orderd one for a friend and she loved it. I decided to get one for my self. it is realy a good selection of color. I love the color and the quality of the material.</li>
            <li> one of the eyeshadow&#x27;s color was broken ... i was surprised that it was broken, because it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> When I received this I was so happy. than after I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;the whole thing fell apart. turns out the whole back was cracked. My husband and I tried everything but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;The upside it has all the makeup... I just wished it wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Great product, great packaging, great shipping.  Good coverage, pretty colours.  No issues at all, I will buy again, and recommend you do too.</li>
            <li> Really unhappy with this product. I received it and two of the shadows were not in tact and they were everywhere. Also, the slides to pull them out broke on the first day. Not a Happy customer</li>
            <li> Had to return it 2x because the case was broken and  then the makeup was broken. was going to replace it a 3rd time and decided to mix match from the broken cases to make a completed set. Would not order again!!!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1YB3J8MU08C0E]]I thought I will never be unlucky while shopping online from Amazon. But I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product and ordered it for my sister. I just received the product today and I can see too many broken peices in the box. Definitely can not gift it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return it for a refund. Highly disappointed. Even though product looks good but due to the broken peices as a result of bad packaging or bad shipping, I can not give more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I received this on 3/28/12 as a birthday present from my best friend. (im going to be 23...yay!!) It was shipped to my home. Upon arriving I found the only issue was the hot pink blush had cracked slightly and spread some dust around the blush compartment. Since I wouldn&#x27;t have used that color anyway I was not at all concerned. The box is about the size of a medium sized tuperware container. The color pots are in fact slightly larger than a dime. But they are beautiful colors to play around with. I found that wetting the brush ( I also recieved additional brushes) before applying worked best as just applying to my lids did not produce the color depth I wanted and faded and brushed off easily when applied dry but thats my personal preference. It does come with many sponge tip applicators and a lip brush. This would be a great gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art but not sure if they want to spend alot of money on higher quality make up. I am very pleased with this item. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love Shany cosmetics and was really excited to find out that my husband had ordered this set for me. I received it today and everything looked great until I pulled out the box from the shipping box. The clear sticker to keep the side closed looked like someone had already opened it, one of the hinges was broken,  then when I opened it all the way there was one missing circle eyeshadow the middle pink blush was broken, and pieces of eyeshadow were stuck in the lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now most people would return however for me they are minor and still love Shany cosmetics and of course will still purch from Amazon. The colors are soo glittery and shimmery which I love!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from and it goes on great. Now I have a brush set from Shany and this which goes well together. Yes the brushes inside may be broken but the makeup still works. Very ergonomic and looks like I spent $70 instead of $40. There&#x27;s so much makeup that it will probably take forever to finish. Comes with a matching bag and box which is nice. So the only problem is the broken brushes but otherwise it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This company is very good at shipping! This product has so many choices to choose from and if you wanted to haul it around you can, because its so perfect for mobility. I like the feature of it folding out it makes easy for storage. It has blushes, lip glosses, and eyeshadows! This is so helpful when they are all together in one place. Kudos!</li>
            <li> Dear sirs. I secured the order, remained is happy with purchase. I wish you the udachnkh of sales of warm responses from buyers and happiness in new year. Yours faithfully, your client Sergey.</li>
            <li> ok makeup this was bought for our daughter.  She only uses certain colors.  Would not buy again because of it not all being used.</li>
            <li> Hello, good afternoon ... I found the super beautiful makeup but vei very broken and I did not like it so!</li>
            <li> this product is great! great to give as a gift for a beginner that are barley starting out. colors are great and it comes in a nice box!</li>
            <li> I like how you have a wide variety of make up to choose from and can wear a different shade everyday!The price is also remarkable for this much make up .</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Shany Cosmetics 32 professional brush kit and I am so excited to try different color combinations! There are every color of the rainbow and then some, I love how they seem to be shimmery which adds a glittery effect to your look. I would DEFINATELY reccomend this to anybody wanting to add to their makeup collection! Let the makeovers begin!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product, really a low quality, used it and and shadows make my eye itch. The ingredients used in this product; seem to be low quality compared to other products. Don&#x27;t recommend; buy a sligtly higher priced product instead or a brand you know well. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I got this $#!+ and I was so excited (for no reason)!!!!! The colors were so off. It did not have those bright vibrant colors as advertised. I got natural dull colors like brown, tan and BS. I wanted pink, purple, blue etc. -_______________________-</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good seller.</li>
            <li> I love that! Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Nice pigmentation.Great for a gift. Would definitely purchase other Shany cosmetics products in the future. Just a little disappointed with the lip gloss. Not as bright as they appear.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are definitely not of good quality, and appear quite cakey when applied. This problem only worsens the longer you use this palette. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year and a half and it&#x27;s already time for it to go in the trash. The mirror broke off within the first few weeks I had it as did all the little eyeshadow brushes it included. As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, the cells are fairly small and messy. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful colors there are a lot to choose from and such a cute case to I just were eye makeup and I love it. A must have and a great gift.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff grand daughter  love it</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Smaller than I expected, but has LOTS of colors. I would definitely say it is more for summer than winter with the shading, but it keeps well. It was in smoldering heat and still was A-OK. I don&#x27;t care for the lip colors or the texture, but I bought this for the shadows. They have a &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; shadow and a regular matte. They go on great with any brush and stay all day if you set them.</li>
            <li> 13 year old and 16 year old loved these kits!  They are big once opened up and contain a lot of choices for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce as a starter kit for my teen daughter. Smaller than I I thought.My daughter was upset about the size .But she still uses it</li>
            <li> This gift was provided to a teen-ager whose parents were not able to provide Christmas gifts for their children due to disability and large medical bills!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get exactly what she wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I just want to add this to my collection so.. But, it doesnt stays and at the end of the day.. Youll have a very dirty face from the amount of loose make up that is running down your face.. UGh..</li>
            <li> I think I am going to like the makeup set and if I do I will get another one for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> There were much variety and choices in a smart case. Well made product exactly as advertised. Great as gift or to use for yourself. Thank you so much. I really love the whole set and the case comes in handy.</li>
            <li> i got this for my sister for her 13th birthday and she loves it. it has a great variety of shades in particular which her and i love. it opens up easily and nicely and can be carried. the makeup is not crappy and you cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> Gotta glamor girl teenager in your life? Order this and make her happy. The makeup seems to be high quality and the price is right for everything that is included. Fun item.</li>
            <li> bought this for my fifteen year old sister and she uses this everyday...the only downside to this product is that when shipped it was not handled with care...the white color(color you use most often) was gone and the eyeshadow was everywhere in the case and i could not return due to it being so close to christmas.</li>
            <li> I started taking a chance with this line and it&#x27;s excellent! The colors is so vibrant! The price right as you get your moneys worth once you make an investment.</li>
            <li> Looks much bigger on line.  One eye shadow was totally missing out of the little circle areas, the blush was so crunched up and all over.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am loving this make-up! My kit was broken like some of other reviews. I even sent one to my best friend. The brushes that come with kit aren&#x27;t what I use, but other than that it is great....not the lipgloss though.</li>
            <li> I purchase item for my 10 yr old daughter who loves make-up and doing her dolls hair, but product came wrap nicely but once open from the bubble wrap.. make-up was broken in tiny liltle pices. the make up fell every where we had piece of make-up all over the living room. so i decided on xmas day to throw make -up in the garabge can. my daughter was very upset because she loved the xmas gift....</li>
            <li> My mom wanted makeup for Christmas and Wal-mart ran out of their bundles. This is WAAAAAAAAAAAAY better!!! for the price, it comes with everything my mom could want, my wife wanted one too!. even come with a mirror and is pretty small so most women could fit it in their purse (my wife has me buy large bags because that&#x27;s the style now)</li>
            <li> Great purchase, quick delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my daughter to use for everyday make-up as well as stage make-up; she absolutely loves it.  It has so many color selections.  Really great gift!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this makeup at all so dissapointed I will never buy from this brand againg thanks you anyways</li>
            <li> Bad and its broken dont buy</li>
            <li> Great for teenagers! The only downfall is the case broke when opening it about a month after my daughter had it so its awkward to put away now.</li>
            <li> I hated the makeup is was so small and the color was ugly</li>
            <li> All the maik up whas broken and the aya shedows all over the box i hope it not gona be some next time</li>
            <li> I am a guy, so I don&#x27;t know anything about makeup, so I am not a good person to review the quality of the makeup in this kit.  However, I can tell you that this is a slick kit.  Everything about it, from the packaging and the box, to the bag and the makeup kit itself seems &amp;#34;high end.&amp;#34;  I bought this kit for my 9 year old godchild who is just beginning to have an interest in girly stuff.  My best friend (her father) was struggling to give me some good ideas for a present for her birthday when he said, &amp;#34;Just buy her some makeup. She&#x27;ll love it.&amp;#34;  So, I set about trying to find the biggest, baddest coolest  makeup kit I could find, and this is where I landed.  What seemed neat to me was the way that this kit folded open to reveal three trays full of different colors of......ummm.....stuff?  Anyway, it turns out that this kit does NOT fold open, but instead it slides open.  At first, my goddaughter thought that it was just the two sides that display when you first open, but I remembered that there were supposed to be several different trays, so we started pushing and pulling on the thing until all of a sudden a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; tray on each side slid open.  It was really cool when that happened.  And then, low and behold, it did it again!  My goddaughter let out a &amp;#34;oh how awesome!&amp;#34; exclamation to a chorus of &amp;#34;ooooohs&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;aaaaaaaahs&amp;#34; from everyone else in the room.  This was easily her favorite present, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a makeup brush kit in metallic purple for her to use to apply all of this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, and I must say that everyone in the room -----including the men-------left with some kind of makeup applied on their face, thanks to the 6 girls who were helping to apply it.  It was a good time for all of us, and this was a real hit.  I highly recommend it for any guy looking to buy a cool present for a young girl.  They will love it, I promise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother, WHO LOVES MAKEUP, and she was just amazed by its variety of colors. One color came broken probably bc of bad shipping handling but didn&#x27;t mind because it was easily replaced with the other dozens it has.</li>
            <li> Love the selection, if you can&#x27;t find the right color. Pick a different dress. This has it all!!</li>
            <li> arrived as seen in photo on amazon looks great bright colours and great packaging the black case of makeup is scratched all over top</li>
            <li> The amount of colors in this palette are amazing. I have tried so many and love them all. The pastel colors are still very vibrant and soft. They stay remarkably bright through the day. However, I do find that they smudge a bit easily. A bit of primer helps. The shimmer shadows are brilliant and very soft as well, however they are not quite as vibrant as the other colors when they are on your skin. The lip colors are more of a glossy texture and very soft, but they are fun to use over a lip stain. The blush is great, but I won&#x27;t actually use it. I do recommend buying or using your own brushes for all of it. The ones it comes with are cheap. Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Fake ! Not recommend.</li>
            <li> was a lovely gift for my girlfriend she was happy and amazed with sooo many products great buy will recommend</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and good. I received the kit and I like it very much. has many colors and is packed nicely. was arranged with great care</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again&lt;br /&gt;smooth application of eyeshadows as well</li>
            <li> Great for your teenage daughters.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and I really like the cream eye shadows :) They are super pigmented!!! The lip colors are super sheer and unnoticeable and they dry out after a few weeks. Also the blush colors are not the best quality. They look pretty in the pan but on your cheek, they look really cakey and heavy....Also the Kit itself broke. The two parts split and now I have to carry two parts....not bad but not great :)</li>
            <li> The colors where amazing .. But the package didn&#x27;t came with a bubble rape and for that the out side box where damage .. And the inside box ( black box ) where damage and cracked all over the box .. The round color can removed easily from the box .. That cause a big problem because it is not stable will leave a big mess</li>
            <li> Esta bellisimo thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a gift for someone else. It arrived in perfect condition., and it looks great in the package.</li>
            <li> I ordered this makeup kit as a present for my daughter. It was an impulse buy because of the half off price at xmas time. Then I read the reviews. After that I was completely upset because I&#x27;d already ordered it and all I could do was hope for the best. When I received the product, I immediately opened it and was pleasantly surprised that every single eyeshadow was in place and not broken. One of the brushes was out of place and that&#x27;s just because they are only taped down. I can see the validity of the craftsmanship being sub par as the trays do completely slide out, but you can put them back no problem. That&#x27;s the only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 from me. All the colors were beautiful and not blase browns as mentioned in other reviews. It is small and compact, but perfect for space saving. Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it she good good for years</li>
            <li> I do like this kit. But I find that some of the eye shadows contain too much oil. The blush however is amazing. Its a nice kit. Im not sure its worth this price. but it really is a nice nice kit.</li>
            <li> The huge variety of colors is great but we got this as a gift for someone, and when they opened it, one of the hinges was broken.  The makeup itself was intact.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my niece.  I knew she loves make-up.  This make-up kit has every color available.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> I really received what the product and seller described. I was afraid to buy it because I saw some negative experiences with some customers. But, I received in perfect condition this make up kit. I like it because I use make up a lot everyday. I  love to combine my outfit with my look so I needed more eye shades so I decided so buy one package that had bunch of different to choose from. They are pretty. Kind of expensive though. Also I did not have any allergic reaction  like for example with other brands. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Very practical, and nothing else is necessary, just this small box.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s impossible, &#x27;cause no woman carry only one thing inside her bag.</li>
            <li> Fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li> very good item it was a perfect gift for my daughter thank you very satisfied</li>
            <li> Not pigmented, is really cute as seen on the pics, it comes on time, n it comes well packed.</li>
            <li> My wife was surprized when this showed up at the house,she thought it was just another package for me. So she was really lost for words yea sometimes the man needs to spend the other way and make eveyone happy. The case has every color you should ever need from lights to darks from browns to yellows, it really has allot in a little box,the box is little and tucks out of the way nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this last week andI got it today on the mail today!&lt;br /&gt;And it came all broke!&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Just received this today and it was a gift for my daughter, one color of blush is completely gone like it was used as well as two of the eyeshadows! One of the applicators is also broken! Extremely disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> El estuche de cosmetico llego destrozado y las sombras todas derramada...no sirvio para nada.&lt;br /&gt;por lo tanto no puedo emitir una opinion favorable de articulo</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from. Love the feel and does not clump. The case on the first one I bought is in great condition now the second one was broken.</li>
            <li> Almost everything in this kit is cloaked in glitter, and its not that big.  If there were a less shimmery version, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Had to return it. Otherwise for its&#x27; value I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good gift as an entry level to doing makeup with the many different colors before deciding what works or not.</li>
            <li> I truly loved this kit,  I use it daily . The colors are so smooth &amp; easy to apply , I will return to your products again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice complete affordable kit for my daughter.  It is very well packaged and convenient to store.  She loves it and enjoys the variety.</li>
            <li> omg this is so butefull iam so happy Great product, great packaging, great shipping. Good coverage, pretty colours. No issues at all, I will buy again, and recommend you do too.</li>
            <li> This is the best Christmas gift I have bought for my girls. They love all the colors. This is the best gift to give and it was price right.</li>
            <li> All and all I am eh with this product. First thing first, as for picture to product. Shadow matches well where as blushes are a LOT lighter in the kit than they appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pigments are rather impressive for some colors but lacking for others. also, shadows are EXTREMELY soft. BE VERY CAREFUL with this as it would not be hard to break the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are definitely going to need some kind of base and finish spray to make these last longer than MAYBE an hour. Again this goes with them being VERY SOFT. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have noticed after having this product for about a week that it can be very hard to get the hinged mirror up to get to the blushes. I have fixed the problem by putting a small piece of tap on the top of the mirror creating a little lift for it to open it more easily. I do not have super large fingers and find it hard to get my fingers into the provided lift hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are an aspiring MUA, keep looking. Want to play with color and have a wide range of color at an affordable price? This is for you. But that is it, it is good for play. I may end up giving it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit was for my granddaughter very nice case and the way it all opens and closes is  nice</li>
            <li> It was very small, and one of the colors was broken and got all over the other colors and lipgloss!</li>
            <li> Purchased for personal use, but this would make a great gift for someone starting their makeup collection. Has so many colors to choose from. Not as pigmented as my MAC and pro line colors, but with a dab of water mixed in goes on like liquid with a stronger, more saturated hue. Great for on the go. We use it on photo shoots. Has made for a great learning tool for my daughter, especially for the eyes and for the low cost, I don&#x27;t care if it gets messed up. Includes brushes which is a big help - one less thing to purchase. Easy to take with you to touch up just about any color. Arrived perfectly in bubble wrap, all colors in their tray.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT GIFT!! LOVE THE GIFT SET STYLE OF IT!! VERY SMALL BUT DURABLE, EASY TO CARRY WITH YOU WHILE TRAVELING:) ITS COMES WITH 168 VERY PIGMENTED EYESHADOWS, 3 BLUSHES, AND 6 LIP GLOSSES; WHICH ARE ALL VERY PIGMENTED!! YOU HAVE SO MUCH MAKEUP TO CHOOSE FROM!! WILL DEFINITELY BE BUYING AGAIN FOR MY MOM!!</li>
            <li> I think this makeup kit works out perfectly. But I would just request some better lipstick brushes. This product still deserves 5 stars though.</li>
            <li> got it for my 8 year old cousin and she loves it. its a great present for ages 8-14</li>
            <li> Wife uses this almost every day for something, she looks good and the kids like to play around every once in a while. I presume she&#x27;s letting them use the colors she doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Make up shreds too much. Was always everywhere when using. Other than that colors are nice. Not long wearing tho.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because when my package arrived one of the eye shadows was broken and part of the tray would not open because the applicators got stuck under the slider. This is not bad for shipped makeup. I love these colors. I have only tried a couple but they are very pigmented. They will show up on any skin tone and you do not need to use much. Works much better with a brush because they are so pigmented. An applicator will make it too bold.</li>
            <li> Meh...not wat I expected,  the colors are not pigmented,  very few of them are, you wud think they&#x27;re from the picture, but they feel like freaking wax, i guess I am gonna have to pile on a tun to bring out the color to pop..kmt..I hate it, cheap quality,  dont worth the money.</li>
            <li> Alot smaller then I imagined however,  still a port size. Only one piece was missing...it&#x27;s ok. Quick delivery! !!</li>
            <li> girlfriend present, she love it</li>
            <li> Really nice colorful set!  I can&#x27;t wait to start experimenting with the different colors.</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s excellent for me.</li>
            <li> Really nice set :) Received it well packaged and its just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Fell apart as soon as I opened it. Very cheaply made and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good price</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I RETURNED THIS ITEM TWICE, AND THE THIRD ONE I RECEIVED WAS IN NEW CONDITION AND I LOVE IT. IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE TO RETURN IT AS MANY TIMES AS IT MANY TIMES TO GET A NEW ONE, IT IS WORTH IT!!! Im really disappointed with the one I received. The hinge was broken, eye shadow and blush was broken and every where. And the two brushes look as though they have been used. I rarely return items and have never given a one star rating, but this is a must for this item. However, I love the item, had it been in new condition I would have given it a five star rating. I&#x27;m asking for an exchange, hope the second one sent will be in new condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase this but still havent just yet. ( I&#x27;m saving up for it) I&#x27;m a makeup lover and also a girl on a bugdet this beautiful set seems amazing and when I get it if I do I will do an updated review. just wanted to say that for so many colors I think the price is great especially for someone who like to save like me.</li>
            <li> My daughter has this and she LOVES IT!! When you open It you cant believe how much product you get. There are so many choices of colors and the quality of the makeup is superb. Top all that with the super amazing price best deal ever!! Get your while they still have them you never know how long deals like this will be around!![[ASIN:B005UKZAJG Shany 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for beginners or someone who loves shimmery bright colors.  Be warned no matte colors.  The price is a little high but you do get a lot of shadows to choose from.  I&#x27;m not a fan of lip glosses in a kit so they would never be used.  Also the sponge applicators are a waste.</li>
            <li> The product could not withstand shipment and arrived to my home in pieces.  The packaging was faulty, but blame should also be placed on the manufacturer for making it so cheap but charging $30+ for it.</li>
            <li> I told my boyfriend I wanted new makeup for my birthday. He generally gives me my gifts a few weeks early (I have no clue why and I hate it.) Last week I asked him what he was getting me and he said he couldn&#x27;t get me anything because he was saving up to go to a concert. Naturally, I got mad and stormed off. He has mostly been receiving the silent treatment ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Today when I came home and checked the mail there was a huge package on the doorstep with my boyfriend&#x27;s name on it. I brought it and asked him what it was. He tried to act like he didn&#x27;t know so I opened it. It was this! I was so happy and apologized for getting angry. I have been playing with it since I opened it. I love the colors, the variety, everything!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Make-Up loving cousin and she loved it :)</li>
            <li> This.product makes the perfect gift our the perfect starting make up kit for any young lady. With the variety in all the make up with the quality, nothing can beat its price! I only wish I knew about this product when I was younger so I could have startedout with this amazing make up set!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my room mate from Amazon last week and it came within the 2 days for Prime shipping. When she opened the box there was basically no padding no bubble wrap no nothing. So OBVIOUSLY the thing was broken. The case was broken,AND the shadow was broken. It was one big MESS! So being the disgruntled customer I was, I quickly contacted Amazon and Joe(Or David..whatever)said that they would send me a new one. Since I was leaving in 2 days, he said that they would send it on next day delivery. I was satisfied with the response I got, so I waited the weekend for the new one to arrive. Today the new shadow kit arrived. It was covered in bubble wrap that might have been a few layers thick AND it was in this bubble padding thingy. My hopes were up. I felt like Amazon did a good job to fix their previous errors. Boy was I in for a big surprise. After pulling away layers upon layers of bubble wrap, I noticed that the box was a bit powdery and when I opened it ONE OF DA SHADOWS WAS MISSING!! Like completely disappeared. The only explanation for it not being being there is that it was NEVER there in the first place. The case also did not open properly. I think it may be broken. I&#x27;ve never had problems with Amazon but now I feel insulted. If it had broken on the way I could have blamed UPS but the damn thing was defective from the start. I had better be getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for teenagers and working women!!!</li>
            <li> What a great starter kit! and at an amazing price! I would love to get this for sister who loves make up and playing with colors!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this kit about 2 weeks ago. And I took it with me on vacation for 4th of July, and I must say. I love everything in it! The price I&#x27;d say is well worth it. The eye shadows are very pretty and pigmented. A little goes a long way. The blushes I just completely fell in love with. The lasting of the eye shadows is good. No need for a primer if you don&#x27;t have one at hand. I would also like to point out the packaging of a form of a tote makes is easier to have everything at hand. I must say I give this product a 5 star quality rating. I absolutely love Shany cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My Shany Product arrived a day early. When I opened the box I discovered that the Shany product had not been bubble wrapped or packaged in styrofoam. Three eyeshadows and one blush was damaged. Powder was everywhere in the blush section. I was frustrated that the seller, or whoever packed it didn&#x27;t even bother to protect the product inside the box. As a business, do they not care about protecting their merchandise? Anywho, The pigment of the shadows are excellent! As a black woman, with dark brown skin, it shows up very well on my skin. No need to spend an arm and leg on super expensive shadows anymore. Shany cosmetics are hanging with the big dawgs lol!!</li>
            <li> I was not happy when I received this product. The colors shown in the pictures where not the colors I recieved. I was expecting the bright colors and neutral colors, but all I recieved were neutral colors. I loved all the diffrent bright colors and this was my main reason for ordering this spefic product.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for a gift, because of my girlfriend&#x27;s bday, and it arrived destroyed, some of the shadows damaged, the box clip destroyed, i dont know what to do</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing this item at first. Every time I see big makeup sets like this, I am very worried about the quality. However, I have purchased other products from Shany Cosmetics before and I was very pleased with them! Decided to just go for it... And so happy that I did! This is a great makeup set for anyone and everyone with very professional grade products!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present for someone and I think the makeup is very nice or the price. It comes in a small convenient case for travel and it has two scraps to carry it around. It does not take up a lot of space. The makeup has lots of colors to choose from. I just love this product. It makes for a very nice gift for someone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big as it looks the case was broke but the makeup product is great it works well and it has a lot of stuff to experiment</li>
            <li> This is an awesome gift for ur bestfriend, girlfriend, mother, etc. It has such a variety of colors of eyeshadow, blush, lipgloss...etc.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows are pretty nicely pigmented and its such a perfect gift!!! Recommend it :)</li>
            <li> this product is really a life saver! it comes with everything needed to have a completed eye makeup! it amazing and there is so much variety! i will definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> The ammount of make-up in this kit is mind blowing.There are so many looks to make.The colors are very pigmented.Every single time I use this is makes me excitied.It folds up very nicely.</li>
            <li> My younger sisters birthday was a few weeks back and she LOVED this item. It comes with so much variety! I&#x27;ll never tell her how much I paid for it though (mainly because she won&#x27;t believe me)</li>
            <li> The quality of makeup is as stated and very lovely and satisfying however was expecting a much more durable very fragile....</li>
            <li> Came partially broken, but mostly intact.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved this makeup</li>
            <li> This was gift to my daughter. She really enjoys using it daily.</li>
            <li> The item I received was used.  The seal was broken, the box was dirty, several powders had been used, a brush was missing and a second brush had been used.  Disgusting.  I have never written a review and order alot from Amazon..  The quality has always been good.  This item was disgusting.  It is being sent back. I had read that othr people had problems with this item such as broken shadows, but this item was dirty and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 2 stars due to shipping challenges.  I ordered it for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and it came damaged.  She was very disappointed, but  was okay with returning it and trying again for an undamaged package.  On the second time around, the package was damaged AGAIN!  Three blue eye shadows were broken and blue dust covered the entire package.  There are no protective coverings on the eyeshadows nor the lip colors.  Everything is covered in blue dust.  My daughter is willing to salvage what is left, but as the purchaser, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of shipping and lack of proper packaging for a mailorder item.</li>
            <li> The shimmery shadows are beautiful, and it folds up very nice and compact. My daughter loved it, and can easily tote it to friend&#x27;s houses for makeup sessions. I noticed some other reviews mention broken cells; the one I recieved was wrapped in several extra thick layers of bubble wrap, and all cells were intact. I think Amazon must have changed the way they ship it, and it works!</li>
            <li> Although this sounds like a great concept it has too much going on. It broke after one week of use because the plastic just could not handle me.</li>
            <li> This product has great colors and nice eyeshadows, but is made of cheap plastic. The moment I opened the first sliding door, it slid completely off and when I tried to slide it back on it would not snap back in.Also, 2 of the small brushes were broken and some of the eyeshadow was smudged. I must have received a defective package. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Even after reading the reviews I still bought it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. The colours are VERY shimmery and do not have a lot of pigment. When used you basically get a pale coloured shiny shadow.&lt;br /&gt;The applicators and the \\&quot;lip stick\\&quot; are laughable. This would not even be comparable to a \\&quot;my first make up kit\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i love my recived item it&#x60;s very best cool, and thank you company for 5 star work&lt;br /&gt;i love my recived item it&#x60;s very best cool, and thank you company for 5 star work</li>
            <li> I love this product the colors are awesome they go on great and they last. There was a problem when shiped to me one of the eye shadows were broken and was everywhere NO BIG DEAL TO ME. I clean it up and used and its great :) Its worth the buy. Lots of Shimmer! which I love</li>
            <li> Good selection, but the brushes fall apart and in my opinion there are not enough of them. But once again there is ALOT of colors to chose from, and a nice plus it all folds up nice and compact.</li>
            <li> all the colors are sparkly and gorgeous! i love how compact the case is and everything was in perfect condition when it arrived all the way to Alaska! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful all of the eyeshadows are and for only $25 I&#x27;m so happy.  The colors are bright and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> My friend has this and i tried it out when i went to hers and i loooove it!! All the shaddows are smooth and pigmented so ypu get a good application. The only thing that my friend finds annoying about it is that sometimes it feels like the case is going to fall apart which is worrying, but apart from that its great!!</li>
            <li> Frustrated... The shadows look like they could have really been nice, beautiful colors, huge variety, except that one of the hinges was broken therefore causing every single eyeshadow except for the very top row before you open it all the way, to be shattered. Honestly I was expecting a few of them to be a little broken up but was ok w/that. I would really love to contact the seller b/c I know things just happen sometimes, but I cannot figure out how &#x3D;/ if not for the case being defective I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars forsure...</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews where it arrived broken. It arrived in perfect condition using Ontrac. The colors are beautiful. I bought this as a gift and they loved it! Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as a gift for a friend, and she loved it so much that I ended up getting one for myself. I really love this kit. So many vibrant colors to choose from. The colors last all day. My kit arrived in perfect condition with no broken or missing items. I will definitely be purchasing more of these sets for gifts this holiday season.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the colors in this palate. They were smaller than I thought but still very pretty. What I don&#x27;t like is that one of my eyeshadow&#x27;s was completely broken up which contaminated the other colors. Also one of the double sided eyeshadow brushes was completely broken. Both lip brushes are unusable as on each individual brush the hairs are of different lengths.</li>
            <li> Im not satisfied with this product. its sitting there collecting dust.  the colors i received are not the ones showing in the picture when I placed the order.  I wanted bright bold colors...instead i got neutrals!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors of eye shadow&#x27;s. I can make any look I want now instead of just the browns I had before. I like that the lip gloss isn&#x27;t thick like some kits I&#x27;ve gotten before. I would order again though I don&#x27;t think I will need too any time soon. -Christina</li>
            <li> Its ok. Nothing was broken I love thst its vegan but...the lip gloss and blush are only ehh. Closed its about 6x6x3 good sise  round 100 wet 76 dry eye color. 3 blush 3gloss</li>
            <li> Love all the choices in this kit.</li>
            <li> I had my girl friend search online for something she liked. She found this kit on Amazon. So I ordered it. I do have to say that it looks better in person than it does in the photo. It has A LOT of colors to choose from, plenty of applicators, and the kit opened up is actually quit large but folds up into a nice cube shape. She says she loves the way the make up feels and it adds just enough sparkle for her. She&#x27;s great at doing her own makeup and loves this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this item. Is the hinges on the case are VERY WEAK! MAKE SURE you check them first. I did not, she opened the box and one was broke... she tried to open the case and the other hinge broke. But, she still uses the makeup case. She just carries it around in a baggie with her..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 months sense I ordered this for her. Over all, this kit is worth the money.  She has been using it everyday and has barely put a dent in it. Sometimes I hear her talking to herself asking what color she wants to use today. There are so many to choose from. She doesn&#x27;t need the makeup to be beautiful but the pleasure I see in her smile when she goes out was well worth the money. You can&#x27;t put a price on that.</li>
            <li> When I got the makeup it was broken and the make up is really hard.&lt;br /&gt;I think that is very unprofessional</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product,  has so many different colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but breaks off easily got the kit with a few broken colors also the brushes are not strong they break easily but other than that got great colors and the colors last</li>
            <li> Def worth the price. I only wish I would have found them a long time ago. Very convenient and great quality.</li>
            <li> Case was broken upon arrival.  Hinges were broken so it was in 2 pieces and the slide out trays were also broken so they do not slide in properly.  Purpose was to use for travel but it won&#x27;t work for that.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little set, however there were two broken eyeshadows which, upon opening, got into the lip glosses. This is a gift for my daughter so she won&#x27;t mind too much, plus they are colors that she won&#x27;t use anyway; if it were a gift for someone other than my own child, I&#x27;d be a bit upset.</li>
            <li> has alot of diffrent colors. my daughter loves it.Gives her a chance to try diffrent colors. and the lip gloss is nice.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is amazing because it is so much, but don&#x27;t get fooled by the quantity. Colors are cake, and some arrive broken, or mixed in with the rest. Most colors are way too bright to be actuallly used. No nuetral tones. Blush is horrible, and the small brushes included don&#x27;t work. They aso arrive all fallen out of their spots. Overall bad product, but the shiny eyeshadows(not the regular ones) are really nice. Not worth the 30 bucks overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  She absolutely loved the makeup kit!!  She expressed excitement to find the right colors for each outfit.</li>
            <li> Came in very good condition. I like all the colors and all the different makeup with in! The handle makes it easy to carry too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it was terrible since I just got it today but I&#x27;ll write another review later when I combine the shadows with my shadow base primer. But I&#x27;m disappointed because I brought this specially for the lipstick and my order came without it. Lucky for me I have plenty of lipstick</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have this product, I REALLY WANT to get it.  It looks great, and seems to offer a lot of colors for eyeshadow, blush, and lip gloss, which is really important for me.  I am thinking of buying it soon.  Also, reading the customer reviews really sparked my curiosity in this product!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was as advertised.  I must say I was skeptical when I ordered this, I tend to stay away from all-in-one kits.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  First it arrived intact with no breakege.  The colors are fantastic. The kit folds up perfectly for travel and is great at home.  There are colors that will work for all skin types and tones.  So this kit is truely for anyone.  The colors are highly pigmented and last for a long time.  I would recommend putting them on with brushes that way a little goes a long way.  I use brushes myself anyway.  I love the way they look and blend.  I am so glad I tried Shany Cosmetics.  LindaW</li>
            <li> I was worried about having this product shipped because of all the reviews in which people had broken palettes. Mine came in perfects condition thankfully! The makeup is pretty nice for the price. It goes on well and I love the variety! A lot of the colors end up looking the same on me and I was hoping there would be a lot of pinks, but the mostly come out looking orangey. I also don&#x27;t like how shimmery the eyeshadow is because it makes me feel like I can only wear it for special occasions instead of everyday. I have not used the lipgloss included, it&#x27;s totally unappealing to me and the blush looks kind of trashy against my pale skin. Despite all that, I really just wanted a nicer variety of eyeshadows without having to dish out the big bucks for some high end make up and this was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This sturdy beautiful little black case packed quite a punch of nice saturated colors to choose from! Great for gift giving and can be compared to several other Top of the line cosmetic company&#x27;s promotional gift sets....with much higher price points! A winner!!!! I would be inclined to order other items from Shany...thank you!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 16 year old cousin.  I had no idea there was so much in this tiny little box.  We kept finding more and more stuff behind each little layer!  She way very pleased with her gift!  I actually had to order myself one as well once I saw how much was actually inside!  I&#x27;m undoubtedly her &#x27;coolest&#x27; big cousin this year.  Great gift, great colors, none of the colors were broken/cracked, well packaged, handles for travel, and also comes with application brushes.  Great buy worth every $$!</li>
            <li> The only problem i had with this product was the box came broke and the blush(which i don&#x27;t use anyway) was broken. That is the only reason i didn&#x27;t give it five stars. I love the color on my skin, i&#x27;m a darker complexion so it&#x27;s hard to find colors that work for me and the lip gloss is also wonderful. It&#x27;s a must have for people who are just starting to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome,I really love the makeup colors. The only thing is one eyeshadow was broken,which I wasn&#x27;t worried about in such a big collection of eyeshadow. The brushes weren&#x27;t the greatest in the kit,but I bought a set of brushes from Shany and they were great to use with this. The colors are gorgeous on my skin,and when used with a primer stick fairly well. I have two minor complaints,which is that the shadow gets powdery so closing this all the way eventually the shadows will get bits of them  stuck into each other so I leave it half way open in my cabinet. The other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that I really love the lipgloss and wish there was more of it in the kit :) I think for the price it is definitely worth it. I read some reviews on how theirs was broken when they got it etc. Mine was shipped fairly well with bubble wrap and had no problems besides that ONE eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> i love these eye shadows long lasting beutiful pigments aand wonderfull shimmer shasdows.&lt;br /&gt;im a cosmetologist as well as a make up artist and i absoultely  love these shadows</li>
            <li> Just got this eye shadow set, and i absolutely love it!!! Just what i needed! Came in perfect condition, and has every color ever needed at least for me! Would definitely recommend to a friend! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my friends reaction when she received this as a birthday present. The pop-up mirror was definitely one her favorite little kinks. She LOVED the color choices and insisted on doing everybody&#x27;s makeup. She&#x27;s used it everyday since it arrived and hasn&#x27;t had a complaint yet. The powder comes up easily instead of being hard (which is a plus), and It&#x27;s design is DEFINITELY cute however, I wish it came with protective covering so it wouldn&#x27;t spill onto the other colors when it&#x27;s closed. Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect &lt;3.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift. It came in promished time so i&#x27;m happy with the purchase and product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My wife loves the product. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> The colors are not what is diplayed.... and some of the eye shadow have finger marks... and the case is flimsy and dirty very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she uses it every single morning. Great product a lot of choices and honestly the price is very very good. Go for it!</li>
            <li> my sister was so happy.. its a good deal. i  dont know what else to say .. it a good product</li>
            <li> this was a great purchases thanks it was a gift and she loved it&lt;br /&gt;this has been the best thing i got on here so thanks</li>
            <li> The collection of colors and different types of use is giving a wide range of selections, and also when combining the colors, they give a nice impression, my wife said she recommend it to every girl and women equally.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  I ordered this as a gift and had the item shipped to the receiver.  It arrived broken - not just the makeup but the case itself.  With so many positive reviews I chanced purchasing this hoping that this one would be one that wasn&#x27;t broken but we were not so lucky.  I am a huge Amazon shopper.  We buy 75% of all our goods on Amazon and this is a rare and huge disappointment.  Since this was a gift shipped elsewhere it will be a difficult return.  Really a bummer.  Listen to the warnings.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> this product is very old,you can not use it. on top of that it came si broke. i will not sugest to anyone to buy this products. they are made in china,proabably shipt from there too..it is all driyed up</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and they are pretty but when I received this package, it wasnt intact and about 3 of the colors were broken and they were all over the box :( I had to gently blow out the color dust as it was resting on the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;I believe they need to package this product better and it&#x27;d be one of the best things a girl can have.</li>
            <li> I really love this makeup it&#x27;s the best and it came on time i am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I must say i viewed this product many time, i even read the  reviews of other customer, and many list this product as being defective. However i still went on a bought it. I was so excited when i saw the little box with the Shany trademark on it, but that excitement flew out the window as soon as i took it out the box. IT WAS A MESS!1 The second blush ( the pretties of them all) was broken and had gotten everywhere... This product is a &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; present to buy for a child, but i honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommended it to anyone... The packagers need to cater for long trips, there is no protective shield on anything, allowing the colors to spill everywhere.. I must say i love Shany cosmetics, but they need to do something about this one product in particular -Jerrisa........ P.S am using my bf Amazon account so i apologize if someone confuse me as a male lol</li>
            <li> This was one of 3 great V day gifts and she just loves it! I&#x27;m a guy and she she told me I nailed this one, she has everything to go with any look!</li>
            <li> Viene completamente con muchos colores de sombras, labial y rubor, me encantan los colores brillantes y de base, son genial</li>
            <li> I received this Shane beauty makeup kit and it was totally  missed up. The foundation broke and are not useable at all. WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife because she likes pink eye shadows, and it looked like it had quite a few pinks. It got here today and 3 of the colors are cracked and broken and 1 is totally missing! It is also the wrong one apparently and its mainly \\&quot;brown-ish\\&quot; gross colors!</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> A very nice kit. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a gift. I think it is very useful, and great for beginners. The blushes are super pigmented (not a good thing), but overall this is essential</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller. Gustavo Leon Venezuela.</li>
            <li> It has 5 stars porue I like the variety of colors and brilliant, makeup lasts all day and the eyes are very pretty. I recommend</li>
            <li> as I listen from my sister  she say she like it but her voise say another thing and I did not know if she really like it or not</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing! I have never used any Shany product before, but from now on I&#x27;m looking for more makeup essentials from Shany.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews said, I was hoping to be a lucky one and get an item that looks like new but guess what? No luck! The item was indeed new and sealed but as soon as I opened it, it was a mess. All the colors mixed, some of the colors were actually out of their place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is so badly designed that it can&#x27;t be flipped upside down cause you&#x27;ll make a mess. Now Amazon selling and shipping this, obviously the thing will get flipped and roll A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess. This was for my girlfriend and she didn&#x27;t care, she just cleaned it and she was thrilled with all those colors and options but honestly, the product came in really bad condition.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I purchased this package as a good basis for practicing special effects makeups. It&#x27;s great for that, however, no matte colors. The lip stick things rub off if you&#x27;re eating and dry after about an hour. Not fun. Also, a cube of silver eyeshadow keeps falling out. The mirror is hard to open. HOWEVER, it came wrapped well, a few eyeshadows were cracked, but mostly, all it was was dusty. I&#x27;d reccomend purchasing you&#x27;re own brushes and lipsticks/glosses. However, the eyeshadow was superb. :3 Helpful tip... to open, put the logo side left (you don&#x27;t need to spin it around like I have).</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago for my cousin as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s all still together, she still uses it and loves it. For any girl who loves wearing makeup, this is an amazing investment for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love every color, but when I received it, one of my colors had been broken and it got everywhere! All over the other colors and all over the palets and box, I was crushed cuz it was a gorgeous color I would have used often :(</li>
            <li> it is everything i wanted.. and cheap to.. and will be getting more later.its colorful and sparkly.. i love the case it is in</li>
            <li> The lip brushes are hard and don&#x27;t work I had to throw them out. I like the colors they mostly are true but a lot of the light blues and greens look exactly the same when on your eye. Over all I think it&#x27;s a good deal but wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a gift and my gf just love it, it&#x60;s a great kit and a great deal, really worth it</li>
            <li> Excelent Product for a gift.. compact and modern..</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND COLOUR LASTS A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I decide but this and I was so exited but wen I recibe this product its toooo small.</li>
            <li> What I expected and more</li>
            <li> I bought the make up and told a friend to bring it to me home. She found that the case was broken. When she came back I found that many the blush is damaged and broken.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. It has basically everything you could need/want/ and ask for. It it such a good gift idea for anyone who loves makeup or just starting out. The price is unbelievable. GREAT GREAT kit</li>
            <li> I had purchased this as a gift for a friend who wants to be a makeup artist. When I got the package, the box was damaged and looked like it had already been open! When I pulled the makeup kit out, there were broken eyeshadows and the kit was completely snapped in two!!! I posted a couple of pictures of my horrible order. I should have listened to the negative reviews!!!! For a product that is $40, you would think it would be packaged better. This is ridiculous!!! I am so upset!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice and returned twice... shipped and package broken.... the box wasn&#x27;t damaged but the make up hinge was broken before packaged. The 2nd time half the make up was busted and all over the place. I don&#x27;t unstand how they can ship it so damaged twice. I do not order this item!! Although I had no problem with amazon in returning it...they were great.</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of the best products I have ever bought. It comes with every thing a girl needs to start her makeup collection, or to make it bigger. You can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality. Never again will I spend more money then necessary on \\&quot;high- end\\&quot; products when this is just the same if not better then them.</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase, I recommend all excellent</li>
            <li> This kit comes with so many colors! It&#x27;s great, but I do wish all the space they used for applicators was used for more lipsticks or blushes (maybe a few light ones)... Also, if you&#x27;re fair skinned you&#x27;ll want to use a good primer under the brighter colors and especially the red shades since they can stain.</li>
            <li> We bought this set for our daughter as &amp;#34;play makeup.&amp;#34;  It is a fantastic price for all that it comes with.  The colors aren&#x27;t super bright but the quality is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great make up set for me. Love the vibrant colours. I would definately come back for more make up shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Daughter LOVES and WELL worth fabulous, low price for what you get.  Couple of the brushes are on the cheap side- bristles fall out- but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> Loe the SHANY harmony makeup kit! I do makeup for a living, and recently purchased this kit to be able to minimize the use of having to carry about 20 different palettes to get the colors I want. The kit is great because there are blues and pinks, rather than just neutrals. If you are also just starting out with your makeup collection and want a big selection this a great starting product.</li>
            <li> Very lovely set. My wife loves it, and that&#x27;s all I need to say</li>
            <li> I received it broken in half</li>
            <li> I have purchased this and thought it was convenient. But when I closed it and reopened it makeup was ever I would not recommend this to anyone or any of their products</li>
            <li> It came on time &amp; no broken pieces of eyeshadow it&#x27;s beautiful thing to have for a makeup artiest or someone that wears makeup &#x27; &lt;33</li>
            <li> Update 10/1/12 I really like this palette, the only downside I could possibly have is that there aren&#x27;t any matte shadows, it isn&#x27;t enough of a complaint to make a big deal out of this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great kit! There&#x27;s everything you need for any fun colorful look. It has so many different shades and the shadows are so smooth. This is a great value for anyone looking to build their collection.</li>
            <li> All the make up you will need is in this box! There are all the color shades that you will want. Perfect for playing dress with your sisters! A great value! :)</li>
            <li> This is so cute...much smaller then I thought but for my teen daughter its absolutely perfect..it much curer then described actually I may be buying more for xmas gifts...we love this thank you so much ...we will be seeing you again in the near future..m</li>
            <li> I was torn between 3/4 stars... It arrived on time, that was good, but like a few others, mine was broken :( I believe I had 3-4 eye shadows that were broken all over, and the case is broken, again, like others.  I don&#x27;t think it should be that difficult, or costly to package a little better...&lt;br /&gt;But, on the bright side, I did get ~95 shadows, and they are highly pigmented. I only \\&quot;tested\\&quot; a blue, but, it was bright!! So overall, this is probably a good purchase if you don&#x27;t mind losing a couple shadows, and not being able to actually use the case like it&#x27;s intended... But, if you&#x27;re like me, and that doesn&#x27;t bother you too much, then, order. They really are good eye shadows!</li>
            <li> This makeup set is the best set I have ever owned. The quality is impeccible and the variety is perfect for any makeup user/lover!! And the price is perfect! Would def recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I got it and was so excited but lots of the squares of makeup were broken and smeared everywhere!! Dont get it!!</li>
            <li> I love this !!!!! Great for beginners &amp;#60;3 But the only problem was that my shiny white was broken ;( Other then that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The first level of the eye shadow is amazing! I get compliments on it all the time! I defiantly recommend this !</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors of this makeup kit. To my dissapointment it came with a couple of colors broke into pieces and messed up others. I tried to replace it but it was sold out. The Box it came in was very scratched up. It sort of looked as someone was trying to clean of prints with a wire brush. To bad!</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected but still lots of color options to choose from. A couple of the eye shadows were broken and made a mess during shipping but nothing you couldn&#x27;t easily clean up.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations at all, product is extremely small for the price and beside that the product came damage</li>
            <li> Came with a broken drawer and 2 of the makeup squares were messed up like someone already opened it. Maybe it was just mine, but still someone to have messed up the makeup and still so it isn&#x27;t someone I&#x27;d like to buy from again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old for Christmas. the make up is quality and many beautiful colors. Portable and cute.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was disappointing when I opened the box and saw an even smaller box inside. It looked much bigger in the picture. I did ready that it was only two pounds, but still I was expecting more. However, when I opened all the neat sliding sections I was very pleased. I love eyeshadow!! And this nifty little case had all sorts of colors :) I immediately played with as many colors as I could.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star rating because all the eye shadow colors are fabulously brilliant and wear great and stays looking good through out the day.I would recommend this product to any women who love to have many colors to choose from for their eye shadow color. The only down side to the kit is our kit was broken in half when we received it so we sent it back and got a replacement fairly quick but then the new one we received had 2 of the eye shadows completely broken out which was a bummer, but other than that the product rocks :)</li>
            <li> Eye shadow variety is great, beautiful colors and the display is very convenient and easy to carry. Very elegant look</li>
            <li> 5 Star for this one...My wife is very happy with it. very fast service and a good product for the price we paid.</li>
            <li> this is an incredible deal. nearly everything you need is in this kit and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced. i love the way the packaging opens up.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;i just loved how the shimmy colors were; they were great on the eyes&lt;br /&gt;I got lots of compliemts&lt;br /&gt;thank youu</li>
            <li> This shopping bag shaped make up kit is so adorable I don&#x27;t really use the blush but I use the shadows very often. And I must say that these eyeshadows are very pigmented, and show up well on my skin tone.  It doesn&#x27;t even look overly shimmery on my eyes like  some shadows do.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit for any girl and for the perfect price! There are so many different beautiful bright colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> I got this set and one for my daughter on christmas and I love it im so glad I got it and found shany on amazon, I love makeup and this is a great set. It came in mint condition . The eye shadows are even more prettier than it shows. I can&#x27;t wait to get more shany cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Mine showed up today broken in half.  The colors are beautiful and otherwise able to be used.  I bought it as a back up set so I am not that upset but the plastic box seems fragile and you are lucky if it arrives in one piece.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is amazing. The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality! With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow! And I can carry this with me when I&#x27;m going anywhere!</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old daughter loves her makeup and has a very distinct style she likes.&lt;br /&gt;This kit makes it possible for her to be creative without breaking my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;The price is low and the quality of the makeup is great.</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited to be ordering this makeup set, the colors looked exactly how I wanted them to, bright and colorful....what I received is completely ugly. I would never wear ANY of the colors that were sent to me they are all really drab and dark and mostly lighter and darker versions of the same colors, plus when I first opened the package, 3 of the eyeshadows were completely crushed and all over the place. I am very dissapointed that I cannot use this product seeing as I payed for it and got something I was not expecting. Would not order this again.  :(</li>
            <li> there are very nice colors, and  you need so very little on the brush your using to make a huge impact it all sits in a big case and is unlikely to break i recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! I was amazed by everything you get for the price. It&#x27;s a great deal! Great for gift giving.</li>
            <li> Well first of all i wanna say that amazon ir a great site to purchanse things online(thumbs up to amazon ;)....right now i am super excited bcoz i got my Shany cosmetic kit one day earlier and no doubt it&#x27;s in best condition,nothing is broken or missing...the eyeshadows are super cute and shimmery and the blushers are fab.......but there is a little thing that i am missing alot and its pink eyeshadow,actually i am pink lover so i love pink eyeshadows but i did&#x27;nt find any pink eyeshadow in this kit...there are some pink eyeshadows but they are more like peach in colour...but anyways this is a great product and rly inexpensive as compare to other kits... so i recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I love it!!!</li>
            <li> yo compre este producto para la escuela  que estu estudiando cosmetologia y me encanta como lo aplico mas dura todo un dia  comprenlo que es buen producto</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  The colors are great and last all day!  Its worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first eyeshadow I have purchased that I can wear and it doesn&#x27;t fade away.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely encourage my friends and family to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with what I received it was a mess, package was broken in half, colors were not protected one of the cells lost its color so there was color dust everywhere mixing with the others, it was a mess, this was supposed to be a birthday present and it was ruined, I will keep the product I&#x27;m afraid if I return it I might get it back in worst conditions or it might take a long time to get my refund, not very happy right now, product needs to be protected in a better package.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this product but when I received it I was very disappointed. The product was nicely wrapped and only one of the shades were broken off, which I expected after reading other people reviews. The thing I found to be disappointing were the colors. I was expecting brights shades of reds, greens, and etc. The colors were not the same like the advertisement and the box image. The pigments are great but I decided not to keep it because it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of stuff in here! But a piece broke off and can&#x27;t get it back together</li>
            <li> Many of the powders were dislodged, broken and unusable. Very cheaply constructed case. I would look to another brand altogether.</li>
            <li> IT IS TRULY BEYOUND MY EXPECTATION I LOVE IT MY WIFE ADORES IT THANK YOU SHANY KEEP MAKING MORE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS LIKE THAT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than it looks. Cheap too.</li>
            <li> it was a gift and my niece like it very much.</li>
            <li> a little too shiny/sparkly for my taste</li>
            <li> It is a fine product. The box is flimsly so if you are not paying attention a drawer can fall out and hit the ground.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of pretty colors.</li>
            <li> 98 shimmer eye shadows&lt;br /&gt;70 pastel shimmer eye shadows or gloss eye shadows&lt;br /&gt;6 lip brushes, 3 blushes,7 sponge brushes, 2 lip brushes, 1 blush brush and 1 mirror&lt;br /&gt;for only $35 ?! where else can you get all this for that price? :X</li>
            <li> Product received cracked and some make up powder all over other parts of case! Eyeshadows were cracked and popped out of spot it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> The Shany 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit is really worth it the set has endless colors so I don&#x27;t need multiple eye shadows, lipsticks and blush to clutter my dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed with the case, the two palettes underneath do not slide out very easily and some of the individual colors  are loose and contributes to the case not sliding properly which can be frustrating to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good buy and I would recommend it to anyone who loves limitless colors.</li>
            <li> great......i buy again for my daughter...she love it.......i will buy for more as gifts.....anytime.......</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I wad receiving the large make up.kit was very disappointed Ordered 2 of these opened the box come to.find that I had 2 boxs one had the name up and the other did not not happy at all</li>
            <li> I didnt order directly from amazon but from their website, i bought this and 3 other pallets and brushes....AND I LOVE THEM!!! absolutely beautiful colors, very pigmented and i seriously cannot wait to order more and start using them on my clients!! If there was a t10 stars theyd be getting that instead of 5 stars!</li>
            <li> DAYS AND HOURS AND WEEKS OF COLOR EXPERIMENTING.&lt;br /&gt;MY MOM LIKED IT AND SAID IT WAS A GREAT GIFT AND THAT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  SHIPPED OUT QUICK AND ARRIVED IN TIME FOR MOTHERS DAY.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price...wide range of colors allow for mixing and blending. Easy to carry while travelling...comprehensive and indeed an all in one kit...</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was very disappointed to see how the little sliders were broken and so were the colors. They were all cracked and mixed into different colors. Thus, I was unable to use the colors. The brushes were low-quality and the hairs of the brush fell apart and created a mess. The colors were all over the lip gloss and the makeup had fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigments were great, thus, I ended up using it as nail color, mixing the colors with top coat and applying it on my nails! So, I would recommend the others with the same situation as me to do so as well! Would give it one-star, however, because of the use I had with it, I&#x27;m giving it two more stars.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves shany eye shadow products. So on a whim this was on Amazon so I got it. The box is not very sturdy. But hey. I would recommend for your sweet heart.</li>
            <li> So many beautiful colors at a great price. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> After reading not so good reviews and others that if you buy the best decision, arrived in perfect condition, better than expected, is not small as some say, a variety of colors, is just beautiful and it sure is not be regret your purchase! I am from Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> When i opened the box i found a lot of powder. Some of the eye shadow became loose or they broke from the molds. It was only two colors. But other than that.. a good product..</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She was like a kid in a candy store. She is 30 and has used many makeup brands in her lifetime and she keeps raving about her Shany. She loves it</li>
            <li> One of my best friends/sisters loves to do makeup.  Rather it&#x27;s on herself or others.  I have been looking for a makeup kit for her, and came across this one.  She LOVED it, great buy.</li>
            <li> Good Quality Makeup. Eyeshadow colors were a little repetitive , would have like to have more lip selections or bigger sample sizes. Case does not have a latch so use caution when storing , as it  can reopen easily.  But Overall I am happy with purchase and price.</li>
            <li> I was not happy, I thought I was going to be satisfied but no, I just received it today and it was all broken (not the makeup but the base where the makeup is)</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and the case was amazing. nothing was out of place or broken it was just in perfect shape</li>
            <li> The product came into its box, and was broken. It was dirty inside with finger marks and makeup rests. The kit was broken in the middle.</li>
            <li> Mine came in decent condition - only one pigment broke on its way. The eyeshadows are all FREAKISHLY sparkly and annoying. They flake off throughout the day even with primer. They&#x27;re dusty and just kind of disgusting. I only like about four of the textures. The lip glosses burn and are made with terrible quality. Even the applicators that come with are trash. It&#x27;d be fine as a gift to pre-teen who is experimenting with makeup, but to any adults, this is garbage. e.l.f. has way better quality palettes.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time and delvered by the time i needed it. There are so many different colors and it will last for a while. This product is the best make up for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for christmas and i love it...there are so many different colors for every mood you are in each day or for whatever outfit you are wearing!</li>
            <li> This a good makeup case, fun lip gloss colors</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> there are so many colors to choose from.  to have purchased this at the sale price of $10 bucks was the best deal i ever made</li>
            <li> I love the colors. Very good quality. I look forward to going out and putting on a new color with my outfits. I would recommed this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyeshadow&#x27;s I had that is in a case with so many options! I love first and foremost how soft they glide on! Secondly, I love the long lasting wear they provide! And third the colors are true to themselves! Last, I love the case provided for these luminous shadows....I wear them not only at night but during the day as well! The colors become more vibrant when you use a liner pencil the same color to outline your eyes and softly and lightly brush the same color shadow on! FABULOUS EYES!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Has eyeshadow and blush plus the brushes to apply the makeup. This set is convenient and great for taking on trips. Everything eaisly organized and in one case. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> This is so much make up for such a little price.  Let&#x27;s not mention it is of quality.  Look at the price!  Just amazing!</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and having the many choices of colors is wonderful</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time but contents were broken.  Will return it and see if the new one matches uo then I will write updated review</li>
            <li> I like the product line and all the color choices to choose from. Product box was damaged and some eye shadows were damaged upon opening.</li>
            <li> gift  they liked it  lots of color</li>
            <li> When i open this up I have so much to choose from.  The eyeshadows are great quality (like my shany palettes) I think its a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> For that many shadows, at this price...how can it get any better? I think the little kit itself is adorable, too.</li>
            <li> Not only is the presentation of this product absolutely beautiful, so are the shades, quality and longevity. Excellent product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good I&#x27;ve had this for a while. &amp; I use it everytime I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> Entregado a tiempo, y cumple con todas las expectativas, al aplicar el maquillaje es duradero y facil de aplicar, miuy practico y es posible llevar a cualquier lugar</li>
            <li> This is also another gift for my cousin and she LOVED IT! She loved it so much she took pictures with it acting silly. :) Bought me so much joy to see that.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002DOO1VA SHANY Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]][[ASIN:B005UKZAJG SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]][[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, Set of 12 Brushes and 1 Pouch, Red]]I love this product , everything blends in very nice. All of my Shany palettes I love them all.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this to be as good as it is. Normally &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; make up&#x27;s are not all that good. The case is nice and solid - the make up was great. She loved it.</li>
            <li> Im beyond content with the variety of this palette.</li>
            <li> Awesome gift for a little girl to play with makeup. Nice case and tons of colors.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I love the palet color and iI think it is a complete and unique product , smells good ....I recomend it..It is good!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this produce , thinking it will be in good condition, had to return the 1st one already. ITS JUST AWFUL!!! I hate this product, all the colors were on each other, few boxes were empty. When I picked the box with full excitement as I bought it as a gift for my sister, I want my money back and a home pick for this, I already had to go so far to return the first one, THIS TIME I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE , IF YOU WANT PLEASE PICK IT UP FROM MY PLACE, AND RETURN MY MONEY BACK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the type of shopper where I like to read reviews first then decide on purchasing an item or not. I read several reviews on this item and even watched vids on it and a lot of them said they received broken cases or broken makeup pieces and it&#x27;s true!! I received a broken package. The colors are nice, nothing to run home and talk about. I&#x27;m just more upset the seller didn&#x27;t take the time to check the container before shipping it out now I&#x27;m going to go through the hassle of either returning it or getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in-law&#x27;s birthday and she LOVES it!! one of the pallets was popped out when she got it, but she was able to get it popped back so I have no problem giving this purchase 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because I wanted a shadow palette for stage makeup. I needed something bright I could pile on. The box came unopened, unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are fairly pigmented, extremely blendable and very wearable. They were still vibrant after 8 hours dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, for me, was a great purchase. It arrived two days after my order was placed.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because apon recieving this the box was already broken however I love this eyeshadow and all the color choices!</li>
            <li> This pallet is everything that a lady need to step out on the town looking and feeling fabulous as ever.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this when its on sale again it was very very very very very very very awesome !</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; very reasonable!</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and I fully expected to be disappointed when the product arrived. I expected it to be messy and all broken up due to the handling that it would have to endure before it got to me; and I must say that I was proven wrong. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and have recommended this product to some of my friends.</li>
            <li> el producto llego roto sin la bolsa de presentacion  y en muy mal estado quisiera contactar al vendedor para hacer el reclamo</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but when I do I want variety.  This kit gives me that and more.  The colors last all day.  Love this product</li>
            <li> My kit arrived with poor packaging. By the time I opened it, It was as if a make up storm hit all the colors. Colored dust everywhere and on every color. The plastic was cheap and broken so I have it all separated because there&#x27;s no way to close it without it falling apart.  Needless to say I am disappointed with the product. So much so that I&#x27;d rather take a loss than deal with the company and try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a 14 year old, her mother now wants one!!</li>
            <li> Well when I received my package in the mail I was a little disappointed that the colors advertised was nothing like the ones I received. The colors I thought I would have been brighter instead I got pastels n darker colors. Not a bad color pallets just wished I got what I ordered..all in all</li>
            <li> Excelente el producto. recomendado 100 % a muy buen precio. el envio fue rapido y llego en buenas condiciones. muy bien todo</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 6 year old daughter but I keep it in my bathroom and use it every day.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I didn&#x27;t have any broken eye shadows or anything. It was very neatly packed and arrived early.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it has many colors.. whoever buys this will NOT be disappointed. ..</li>
            <li> I love the kit it&#x27;s just what I wanted I wish it cam wit concealer but it was worth every penny I spent for it</li>
            <li> I was received this item sometime again and I was not PLEASED at all, it was broken and some makeup had spilled out.....and the case so small what&#x27;s up with that.. I really wan my money back don&#x27;t buy this.........: (</li>
            <li> i like it alot but when i got it in the box was broken which is the 2nd time i order it &amp; both time they come in broken but other than improving their package. i like it alot!!!!!!!!! this a very good brand &amp; enojy all the different beautiful color:)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when I opened this :) Defently worth the money!!!! Love all the diffrent colors to choose from. I work 12 hours and the color stays on all day dosent even rub off. I definitely will buy more products from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it! It has a great variety of makeup and condenses to a convenient size for  everything that&#x27;s in there. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time case is nice, seems to hold together nicely, and my daughter is very happy with it</li>
            <li> Packaged very niceâ¦purchased for my cousin and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Ok product no problems. Was a little smaller than I expected but not much...</li>
            <li> as described, Christmas gift to granddaughter and she loved it.  She&#x27;s 9 years old.  Wide range of colors, very nice kit, should&#x27;ve bought one for myself too.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is amazing. The eyeshadow are pigmented and high quality! With this whole kit, I would be fine without buying any more makeup since it comes with everything from blushes, lip gloss, to eyeshadow! And I can carry this with me when I&#x27;m going anywhere!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors, and it&#x27;s so affordable. It&#x27;s the perfect gift. Oh yeah, and its pretty fun to play around with. (:</li>
            <li> This is an affordable makeup kit that has everything from eyeshadow to blushes.  This kit contains everything you need to complete a look.  The packaging is very nice and durable.  The shadow to the blushes are very pigmented and nice.  Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister for her 12th birthday (b/c she is following her sister&#x27;s steps of becoming a makeup addict XD) and so far she has liked it. It kind of reminds me of the sephora block buster set. Anyway if you are familiar with the 120, or 180 palettes, this is the same quality as those. Each individual eyeshadow is pretty small but from experience it takes forever to use even one. There is alot of selection and at a very affordable price. As always with prime shipping, you get the package super fast and do not have to deal with the uncertainty of evilbay.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing! Just throw everything you own out, and buy this! Every single piece is highly pigmented and stays on for hours. You can create thousands and thousands of unique looks with just this set. It is a great gift (and they&#x27;ll never know how much you didn&#x27;t spend!). This set really just has it all. I leave it on my makeup table and use it every day. I always say it doesn&#x27;t matter if its name brand, I just want it to work - and this stuff works! I highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wowee! This product has so many colors! I love being able to play around with all of them. I wish the packaging was different, and you could break apart the elements for easier storage. The pigmentation of the shadows, blushes, and lip colors is really great! The blushes are not very wearable, maybe better for darker skin tones, but I&#x27;m pretty fair so they looked a little wild on me. I love that the possibilities of eye looks are endless! This is the perfect gift for a beauty junkie! It has colors perfect for neutral and crazy bright looks. The colors don&#x27;t crease and stay put, but go on a lot better with a primer. If you are trying to build up your makeup stash, this is a great thing to purchase!</li>
            <li> I have order and returned this twice because of breakage. The hinge is broken when receive and honestly I have not looked beyond that to see if anything else is broken. Packing material is excellent, handling seems to be good, it is just very, very cheaply made. I plan to avoid it and would recommend the same of anyone else. I love Amazon on these situations and wish they would go a step further and weed out junk products like this.</li>
            <li> This was just what I&#x27;ve been looking for! I use it daily. The eye shadow palettes are filled with vibrant colors, I&#x27;m in love with the blushes &amp; bronzers, &amp; the lip pallete is nice as well!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! It has a huge color choice and the pigmentation or color pay off is fantastic. I would definitely tell all of my friends that are in to makeup like me to get this! Shany Cosmetics never fails.</li>
            <li> The box was bent and the shadows was crumbled I tried to get my money back but a no go don&#x27;t think I will shop for make up like this agin</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of makeup and I love how it&#x27;s all put together in the cute protective case. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect makeup as decribed</li>
            <li> Wonderful collection of super bright colors, barely needs more than one swipe for the wanted effect</li>
            <li> This is very nice. new. However it doesnt explain what is any eyeshadow, what is a lipstick and what is a eyebrow color. And it definatly did not come with enough applicators. It is very finiky to close. I purchased this for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is perfect for experienced makeup artists or for people who like to do friends makeup or someone just starting out. It has so many eye shadows you can easily do a month and half of eye shadow looks and NEVER repeat a look. It includes blush and lip gloss, if you have good skin that doesn&#x27;t need foundation, this is truly your all in one look box. You can&#x27;t buy this much product for that price ANYWHERE. The colors last for a long time (I use primer), and they are super rich and don&#x27;t dry them out. I honestly couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better, cheap but great product. I love SHANY products, if you look in my room you will see probably 15 brushes and 2 huge (easily 300 different eye shadows) palettes. I do have a review on my blog and starting to do tutorials, check them out just to see how rich the color is [...]</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy and very disappointed when I opened the package and saw the make-up was cracked! The case was also cracked cannot be put back together! Didn&#x27;t want to  bother  sending it back for me losing shipping expenses.</li>
            <li> makeup get ruined to me  and can&#x27;t use this way, so i return this items but don&#x27;t return my money,</li>
            <li> SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce A lot Beauty colors . . . . .</li>
            <li> This product looked wonderful... until I got it. When I opened the box the little cakes were cracked and some had fallen out and gotten all over the place. Wonderfull item, just get better shipping.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly. Goes on soft and smooth, really shimmery. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 was the hinge on the box was broke when I got it out of the box  but superglue fixed that and one cell was broken everywhere.</li>
            <li> thank you very much it was a good step and I hope I like the product hereby keep buying many products</li>
            <li> Omg this is a must have..i just got mines and I really love it..the quality is awesome!,came in a very safe n secure package.</li>
