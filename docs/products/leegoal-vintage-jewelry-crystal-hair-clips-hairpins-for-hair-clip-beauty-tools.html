            <li>Super cute and awesome!</li>
            <li>and it is a nice look.</li>
            <li>The combination of the two colors would be nice.</li>
            <li>The one I received was more gold-colored than in the photo, but is still gorgeous.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal</li>

            <li>Buying again because nice price.</li>
            <li>Absolute top quality and appearance!!!  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a hit/miss kinda seller, but for this particular purchase I am very happy..</li>
            <li>it it would be great when ya want something for you hair when your dressing up for a special night.</li>
            <li>It breaks easily, but good deal.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was not too jeweled and had a very strong clip.  </li>
            <li>I love it even more in person than online!</li>
            <li>really good -the price was good for such a beautiful hair slide</li>
            <li>but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then this would be a good clip for you or if your hair isn&#x27;t as fine.</li>
            <li>I really love wearing it and always receive nice comments about it.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product, and while it is a beautiful piece, I am not as happy with the product as I could be.</li>
            <li>it would fall right out of my hair lol.  </li>
            <li>They are large and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Very showy &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34;, a beautiful Hair accessory.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to get to me but worth the wait... Beautiful and excellent quality</li>
            <li>it is very detailed and has weight to it.</li>
            <li>It looks very cheap in person.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty clip and works fairly well.</li>
            <li>Makes an excellent gift and people will think you spent a lot more than you did!</li>
            <li>Ok though, because it&#x27;s super cheap and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>But above a ponytail, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>My favorite going out hair accessory.</li>
            <li>how but the mailman, knew and made sure they both got in her box.  </li>
            <li>I try to order in pairs and am so glad I do.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to buyting more.</li>
            <li>stunning detail on the item....</li>
            <li>Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better.</li>
            <li>I love this hair piece,  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was very well made or as attractive as the picture.</li>
            <li>, many compliments</li>
            <li>and I was able to work with it.</li>
            <li>Lovely and packaged well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stunning........</li>
            <li>I have bought MANY of this seller&#x27;s hair clips......</li>
            <li>It has a lot more gold coloring on it than shows up in the photo</li>
            <li>but it looks very similar to the photo but even more beautiful!</li>
            <li>Love the framework on this clip.</li>
            <li>Got many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This piece is so lovely.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time and many</li>
            <li>This is a lovely hairpin with intricate leaves detail.</li>
            <li>Shiny and very elegant, it looked very nice in the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>But wow, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very nice and classic design.</li>
            <li>that is big, the jewels are nice, it holds all my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to do a lot, it just looks great.</li>
            <li>Nice size very pretty</li>
            <li>Kind of fell apart on me fast!!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Solid, eye catching and a pleasant surprise for the money..</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t cheap at all but pretty!!!</li>
            <li>and I love unique style hair products.  </li>
            <li>It slips out of my hair too easily.</li>
            <li>The clip is strong and holds up all day as I use it a lot to work (office environment).  </li>
            <li>It is pretty and the quality is nice.  </li>
            <li>Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Its so beautiful though and is the only clip I found with a  neutral color palate.</li>
            <li>and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up against her dark hair but with the gold it will stand out beautifully!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really beautiful, and i can wear it for short events, but i have to keep redoing my bun.</li>
            <li>So if you have fine or medium fine hair it is going to pull at your hair when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>No problem with it staying in, nice large piece.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made!</li>
            <li>Super excited about wearing it to a wedding soon!</li>
            <li>Unless you have a huge amount of hair</li>
            <li>cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s larger than i had anticipated and is a great addition to my collection</li>
            <li>but anyways... the important part is they didnt fulfill my order correctly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to secure your and hair and would need to be used decoratively only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thought it might be to big and gaudy, but it turned out to be great.  </li>
            <li>It looks real good but is so heavy</li>
            <li>It feels fairly secure in my hair, and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li>I feel that I got more than my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Mine had gold accents, somewhat cheap looking, but then again it is cheap to buy</li>
            <li>the picture of it dosent do it justice...and it looks fantastic on bblonde hair..</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful piece of hair clip, heavy and is stunning on.</li>
            <li>The metal is very cheep and bends very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this very much.</li>
            <li>Great price for a bold and beautful big hair clip.</li>
            <li>But worth it!</li>
            <li>Then it may be perfectly useful!</li>
            <li>I love pretty things for my hair and this is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That said, it is really pretty and I am enjoying having it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t silver like the picture, more of a gold (I will upload buyer photos in a second here), but it was honestly prettier in person than the picture showed.</li>
            <li>Thanks, really good quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li>This hair pin is quite lovely with a unique antigued look, very sturdy, and I&#x27;m anxious to wear it on that perfect special occasion.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a black one, since most of these barrettes are made in multi-colored designs, and this would be both more formal and business like.</li>
            <li>it goes good with different color</li>
            <li>It would work best for people with thick hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>The saying is true.  </li>
            <li>I mean many people have commented on how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li>Beautiful design with black jewels and distressed-looking silver.</li>
            <li>and it held it up just great without needing any other product.  </li>
            <li>I like telling them the price and how quickly I received it from China.</li>
            <li>I say it was and not that it does because it got  thrown away quickly.  </li>
            <li>*&#x27;s for sure, for my particular transaction.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase another just because I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>no complaints, very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is still very pretty</li>
            <li>but this clip is very pretty</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY PRETTY</li>
            <li>beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li>this hair clip is beautiful, however, it&#x27;s so heavy, it slides out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is also very well made with a strong clip.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very pretty and worth the cost and wait, but I am rating it with 3 stars because the metal is gold instead of silver like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>They work nicely to embellish a hairstyle, like a bun or French twist, but I need to use something else to secure my hair first.</li>
            <li>BUT, WORTH THE WAIT ...</li>
            <li>I found it to be light enough to wear without causing any pain as in most metal hair accessories.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get here, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>maybe a nice present, too.</li>
            <li>Oh and btw I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the gas driving to the post office.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS WORTH</li>
            <li>Larger and heavier than I expected but a very nice, elegant looking piece.</li>
            <li>Lovely but will not be able to use due to size and weight.</li>
            <li>very large and worth the price.</li>
            <li>quality at the right price</li>
            <li>it just falls right through.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful hair clip and looks more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li>Still pretty, but definitely doesn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use it as much as I would have liked to but won&#x27;t return it because it comes from China through imports and was a inexpensive enough price.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hair clip, its a little heavy but its nice</li>
            <li>and I like the detail very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, but not crazily so.</li>
            <li>love it Bigger than it appeared</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, good quality and so, so pretty.</li>
            <li>Design is not as pretty as the photo implies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>As pretty as pictured</li>
            <li>This is another pretty barrette from China.</li>
            <li>so you have to still use a lot of pins first to hold both hair and clip up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use to hold a curtain back for decoration.</li>
            <li>The click breoken  when first time use.</li>
            <li>would buy more in different styles and colors!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the metal is not silver, it is gold colored.</li>
            <li>The item arrived sooner than I expected it, which was a nice surprise as I know things from overseas take longer to ship.</li>
            <li>this was pretty but did not appeal to me like the others</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this slide is great when I wear my hair up</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fully realize how big they would be, though, or more to the point,</li>
            <li>Still, for the price, she was able to wear it over ten times with no problems.</li>
            <li>Good heavy clip that holds well in the hair.</li>
            <li>These clips are very pretty (I bought two) -- just like the picture, in nice shape with no crystals missing.</li>
            <li>I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was actually pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, but I really thought it looked pretty in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and it looks really nice with my hair color.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful but came broken</li>
            <li>Quality was good, but it really is too big and heavy to wear comfortably in hair.  </li>
            <li>And its made strong so it will last longer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not looking for a large hair clip, then don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick long hair!</li>
            <li>Although a little heavy for use in an up-do, I find it makes an excellent clip for sweaters and shawls . . .</li>
            <li>lovely, very exotic yet subtle enough for day wear</li>
            <li>It arrived much sooner than the site said it would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very versatile.</li>
            <li>It looks very Victorian.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This piece was much better quality than I expected for this price.  </li>
            <li>VERY HEAVY!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I wrote to the company and after several exchanges, they agreed to replace it for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them strictly as decoration in my hair, they are not under any pressure or holding much hair.</li>
            <li>oh my gosh, this is sooo much lovelier in person then the foto....</li>
            <li>Lasted a whole four weeks.</li>
            <li>Kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>Daughter picked this out for the Mrs., Pretty sweet actually.</li>
            <li>You should make available more black and white.</li>
            <li>quality is as one would expect, the back prongs don&#x27;t line up perfectly, and to be honest, like ALL similar clips, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked (and</li>
            <li>pretty but heavy and large for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its bigger than I expected (approx. 4&amp;#34;) and nice details for probably being made with a chopstick and a 2000 year old ball peen  hammer.</li>
            <li>I love this black hair</li>
            <li>I have super short hair</li>
            <li>These are really pretty but a little larger than picture shows should still be nice for my bridesmaids to wear for my wedding</li>
            <li>Perfect for long, thick, and coarse locks, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li>This items far exceeds my expectations, it is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short.</li>
            <li>The part where the alligator clip part was wouldn&#x27;t shut because it was completely crooked and it would just fall right out of my hair,  </li>
            <li>and I wear this very frequently.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very early with neat packing .</li>
            <li>For a more casual look I&amp;#34;ll sometimes use a very light hair band on the front, twist the back side, clip and go.  </li>
            <li>She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  </li>
            <li>the pretty design wasn&#x27;t even attached to the clip well enough to stay on.</li>
            <li>The replacement arrived 20 days later and broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It is only pretty from afar.</li>
            <li>Also, the gems are a little smaller than the setting, so you can see that they don&#x27;t really fit right.</li>
            <li>never had a chance to really wear it because,  well like I said,  the metal was crooked and the main design wouldn&#x27;t stay on,  </li>
            <li>But the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; on this is super weak and the clip itself is smooth (not toothed)</li>
            <li>This comb is very pretty and the center of the flower was clear crystal but didn&#x27;t look like that in the picture.</li>
            <li>Looks fine but is WAY too heavy.</li>
            <li>, the little gems are kinda cheap</li>
            <li>Works great as a hairpin, but the above display picture does not perfectly match what I got.</li>
            <li>I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair pin, got it a bit late.</li>
            <li>That surprised me so</li>
            <li>Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  </li>
            <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It is pretty,  and also pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheaply made, but has significant weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Better quality clip, has long pins and all heavy metal for a sturdy hold.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re gentle with it though, it should hold up alright.</li>
            <li>Pretty but heavy for normal hair.</li>
            <li>I super glued it a few times then gave up on it.  </li>
            <li>Falls down right away.</li>
            <li>Very pretty item but heavy.  </li>
            <li>The clip has one main flaw - it is really quite heavy.  </li>
            <li>Coming from China, my expectations were quite low, so I was pleasantly surprised at he quality.</li>
            <li>Nice pin, but, unfortunately, absolutely  useless</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, but not crazily so.</li>
            <li>This is the first black hair clip I have I have gotten compliments as to the beauty of the clip.</li>
            <li>This is a little heavy but so pretty that it is worth the weight</li>
            <li>Very large heavy duty clip.</li>
            <li>Under three bucks, shipped from an unknown company in China, let&#x27;s be realistic</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, but it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but also very heavy.</li>
            <li>Too bad because it looks nice!</li>
            <li>It is heavy for my hair and not as pretty as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but very disappointing, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get a black and silver piece.</li>
            <li>It is antique gold in color, and the gold edges around the black gems are much thicker than they look.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick heavy hair, these are great &amp;#34;hair jewelry&amp;#34; to spice up your hair for any occasion where you need black</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty piece and probably meant for someone with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>this is very well made for the price, holds hair in place and stays put with the tight holding clip.</li>
            <li>Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly large clip, and it is a bit on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is large and heavy.</li>
            <li>For someone with fine or thin hair I can definitely see it falling out or pulling on their head</li>

            <li> Super cute and awesome!</li>
            <li> and it is a nice look.</li>
            <li> The combination of the two colors would be nice.</li>
            <li> The one I received was more gold-colored than in the photo, but is still gorgeous.</li>

            <li> it it would be great when ya want something for you hair when your dressing up for a special night.</li>
            <li> It breaks easily, but good deal.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was not too jeweled and had a very strong clip.  </li>
            <li> I love it even more in person than online!</li>
            <li> really good -the price was good for such a beautiful hair slide</li>
            <li> but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then this would be a good clip for you or if your hair isn&#x27;t as fine.</li>
            <li> I really love wearing it and always receive nice comments about it.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product, and while it is a beautiful piece, I am not as happy with the product as I could be.</li>
            <li> it would fall right out of my hair lol.  </li>
            <li> They are large and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Very showy &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34;, a beautiful Hair accessory.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get to me but worth the wait... Beautiful and excellent quality</li>
            <li> it is very detailed and has weight to it.</li>
            <li> It looks very cheap in person.  </li>
            <li> This is a very pretty clip and works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Makes an excellent gift and people will think you spent a lot more than you did!</li>
            <li> Ok though, because it&#x27;s super cheap and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> But above a ponytail, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite going out hair accessory.</li>
            <li> how but the mailman, knew and made sure they both got in her box.  </li>
            <li> I try to order in pairs and am so glad I do.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to buyting more.</li>
            <li> stunning detail on the item....</li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better.</li>
            <li> I love this hair piece,  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was very well made or as attractive as the picture.</li>
            <li> , many compliments</li>
            <li> and I was able to work with it.</li>
            <li> Lovely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stunning........</li>
            <li> I have bought MANY of this seller&#x27;s hair clips......</li>
            <li> It has a lot more gold coloring on it than shows up in the photo</li>
            <li> but it looks very similar to the photo but even more beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love the framework on this clip.</li>
            <li> Got many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This piece is so lovely.</li>
            <li> I wear it all the time and many</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hairpin with intricate leaves detail.</li>
            <li> Shiny and very elegant, it looked very nice in the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> But wow, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very nice and classic design.</li>
            <li> that is big, the jewels are nice, it holds all my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to do a lot, it just looks great.</li>
            <li> Nice size very pretty</li>
            <li> Kind of fell apart on me fast!!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Solid, eye catching and a pleasant surprise for the money..</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t cheap at all but pretty!!!</li>
            <li> and I love unique style hair products.  </li>
            <li> It slips out of my hair too easily.</li>
            <li> The clip is strong and holds up all day as I use it a lot to work (office environment).  </li>
            <li> It is pretty and the quality is nice.  </li>
            <li> Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Its so beautiful though and is the only clip I found with a  neutral color palate.</li>
            <li> and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up against her dark hair but with the gold it will stand out beautifully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really beautiful, and i can wear it for short events, but i have to keep redoing my bun.</li>
            <li> So if you have fine or medium fine hair it is going to pull at your hair when you wear it.  </li>
            <li> No problem with it staying in, nice large piece.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made!</li>
            <li> Super excited about wearing it to a wedding soon!</li>
            <li> Unless you have a huge amount of hair</li>
            <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s larger than i had anticipated and is a great addition to my collection</li>
            <li> but anyways... the important part is they didnt fulfill my order correctly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to secure your and hair and would need to be used decoratively only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought it might be to big and gaudy, but it turned out to be great.  </li>
            <li> It looks real good but is so heavy</li>
            <li> It feels fairly secure in my hair, and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I feel that I got more than my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Mine had gold accents, somewhat cheap looking, but then again it is cheap to buy</li>
            <li> the picture of it dosent do it justice...and it looks fantastic on bblonde hair..</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful piece of hair clip, heavy and is stunning on.</li>
            <li> The metal is very cheep and bends very easily.</li>
            <li> Love this very much.</li>
            <li> Great price for a bold and beautful big hair clip.</li>
            <li> But worth it!</li>
            <li> Then it may be perfectly useful!</li>
            <li> I love pretty things for my hair and this is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That said, it is really pretty and I am enjoying having it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t silver like the picture, more of a gold (I will upload buyer photos in a second here), but it was honestly prettier in person than the picture showed.</li>
            <li> Thanks, really good quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This hair pin is quite lovely with a unique antigued look, very sturdy, and I&#x27;m anxious to wear it on that perfect special occasion.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a black one, since most of these barrettes are made in multi-colored designs, and this would be both more formal and business like.</li>
            <li> it goes good with different color</li>
            <li> It would work best for people with thick hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> The saying is true.  </li>
            <li> I mean many people have commented on how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li> Beautiful design with black jewels and distressed-looking silver.</li>
            <li> and it held it up just great without needing any other product.  </li>
            <li> I like telling them the price and how quickly I received it from China.</li>
            <li> I say it was and not that it does because it got  thrown away quickly.  </li>
            <li> *&#x27;s for sure, for my particular transaction.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase another just because I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> no complaints, very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is still very pretty</li>
            <li> but this clip is very pretty</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY PRETTY</li>
            <li> beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li> this hair clip is beautiful, however, it&#x27;s so heavy, it slides out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also very well made with a strong clip.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very pretty and worth the cost and wait, but I am rating it with 3 stars because the metal is gold instead of silver like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> They work nicely to embellish a hairstyle, like a bun or French twist, but I need to use something else to secure my hair first.</li>
            <li> BUT, WORTH THE WAIT ...</li>
            <li> I found it to be light enough to wear without causing any pain as in most metal hair accessories.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> maybe a nice present, too.</li>
            <li> Oh and btw I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the gas driving to the post office.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS WORTH</li>
            <li> Larger and heavier than I expected but a very nice, elegant looking piece.</li>
            <li> Lovely but will not be able to use due to size and weight.</li>
            <li> very large and worth the price.</li>
            <li> quality at the right price</li>
            <li> it just falls right through.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip and looks more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li> Still pretty, but definitely doesn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it as much as I would have liked to but won&#x27;t return it because it comes from China through imports and was a inexpensive enough price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, its a little heavy but its nice</li>
            <li> and I like the detail very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, but not crazily so.</li>
            <li> love it Bigger than it appeared</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, good quality and so, so pretty.</li>
            <li> Design is not as pretty as the photo implies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> They look exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> As pretty as pictured</li>
            <li> This is another pretty barrette from China.</li>
            <li> so you have to still use a lot of pins first to hold both hair and clip up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use to hold a curtain back for decoration.</li>
            <li> The click breoken  when first time use.</li>
            <li> would buy more in different styles and colors!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the metal is not silver, it is gold colored.</li>
            <li> The item arrived sooner than I expected it, which was a nice surprise as I know things from overseas take longer to ship.</li>
            <li> this was pretty but did not appeal to me like the others</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this slide is great when I wear my hair up</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fully realize how big they would be, though, or more to the point,</li>
            <li> Still, for the price, she was able to wear it over ten times with no problems.</li>
            <li> Good heavy clip that holds well in the hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are very pretty (I bought two) -- just like the picture, in nice shape with no crystals missing.</li>
            <li> I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was actually pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, but I really thought it looked pretty in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and it looks really nice with my hair color.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but came broken</li>
            <li> Quality was good, but it really is too big and heavy to wear comfortably in hair.  </li>
            <li> And its made strong so it will last longer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a large hair clip, then don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick long hair!</li>
            <li> Although a little heavy for use in an up-do, I find it makes an excellent clip for sweaters and shawls . . .</li>
            <li> lovely, very exotic yet subtle enough for day wear</li>
            <li> It arrived much sooner than the site said it would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very versatile.</li>
            <li> It looks very Victorian.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> This piece was much better quality than I expected for this price.  </li>
            <li> VERY HEAVY!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I wrote to the company and after several exchanges, they agreed to replace it for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them strictly as decoration in my hair, they are not under any pressure or holding much hair.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, this is sooo much lovelier in person then the foto....</li>
            <li> Lasted a whole four weeks.</li>
            <li> Kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> Daughter picked this out for the Mrs., Pretty sweet actually.</li>
            <li> You should make available more black and white.</li>
            <li> quality is as one would expect, the back prongs don&#x27;t line up perfectly, and to be honest, like ALL similar clips, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked (and</li>
            <li> pretty but heavy and large for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its bigger than I expected (approx. 4&amp;#34;) and nice details for probably being made with a chopstick and a 2000 year old ball peen  hammer.</li>
            <li> I love this black hair</li>
            <li> I have super short hair</li>
            <li> These are really pretty but a little larger than picture shows should still be nice for my bridesmaids to wear for my wedding</li>
            <li> Perfect for long, thick, and coarse locks, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li> This items far exceeds my expectations, it is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short.</li>
            <li> The part where the alligator clip part was wouldn&#x27;t shut because it was completely crooked and it would just fall right out of my hair,  </li>
            <li> and I wear this very frequently.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very early with neat packing .</li>
            <li> For a more casual look I&amp;#34;ll sometimes use a very light hair band on the front, twist the back side, clip and go.  </li>
            <li> She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  </li>
            <li> the pretty design wasn&#x27;t even attached to the clip well enough to stay on.</li>
            <li> The replacement arrived 20 days later and broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It is only pretty from afar.</li>
            <li> Also, the gems are a little smaller than the setting, so you can see that they don&#x27;t really fit right.</li>
            <li> never had a chance to really wear it because,  well like I said,  the metal was crooked and the main design wouldn&#x27;t stay on,  </li>
            <li> But the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; on this is super weak and the clip itself is smooth (not toothed)</li>
            <li> This comb is very pretty and the center of the flower was clear crystal but didn&#x27;t look like that in the picture.</li>
            <li> Looks fine but is WAY too heavy.</li>
            <li> , the little gems are kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Works great as a hairpin, but the above display picture does not perfectly match what I got.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair pin, got it a bit late.</li>
            <li> That surprised me so</li>
            <li> Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  </li>
            <li> Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It is pretty,  and also pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made, but has significant weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Better quality clip, has long pins and all heavy metal for a sturdy hold.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re gentle with it though, it should hold up alright.</li>
            <li> Pretty but heavy for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I super glued it a few times then gave up on it.  </li>
            <li> Falls down right away.</li>
            <li> Very pretty item but heavy.  </li>
            <li> The clip has one main flaw - it is really quite heavy.  </li>
            <li> Coming from China, my expectations were quite low, so I was pleasantly surprised at he quality.</li>
            <li> Nice pin, but, unfortunately, absolutely  useless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, but not crazily so.</li>
            <li> This is the first black hair clip I have I have gotten compliments as to the beauty of the clip.</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy but so pretty that it is worth the weight</li>
            <li> Very large heavy duty clip.</li>
            <li> Under three bucks, shipped from an unknown company in China, let&#x27;s be realistic</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but also very heavy.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it looks nice!</li>
            <li> It is heavy for my hair and not as pretty as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but very disappointing, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get a black and silver piece.</li>
            <li> It is antique gold in color, and the gold edges around the black gems are much thicker than they look.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick heavy hair, these are great &amp;#34;hair jewelry&amp;#34; to spice up your hair for any occasion where you need black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty piece and probably meant for someone with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> this is very well made for the price, holds hair in place and stays put with the tight holding clip.</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly large clip, and it is a bit on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is large and heavy.</li>
            <li> For someone with fine or thin hair I can definitely see it falling out or pulling on their head</li>
            <li> I love the pin, but I have to wear it on a jacket because it is far too heavy to wear in my thin, short hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The barrette/clip is strong enough to hold up all of my hair, which is about 2 /12&#x27; long, and very thick and wavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty though and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> It is gold and black but very classy looking.  </li>
            <li> pretty but not a nice as it was in the picture.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the correct black flowered/rose hair clip and contacted the seller who e-mailed back an apparently cut and past/rehearsed response that to me personally was not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Like many other bedazzled jewel hair clips, this one is decently heavy and requires somewhat thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the heavy side, but I received tons of compliments on how pretty it was.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not like butterflies as much as you would think a woman does</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> LONG WAIT TO BE SHIPPED,</li>
            <li> The clip is,&lt;br /&gt;I would describe it, like an alligators mouth, no teeth, opening, long prongs.  </li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> larger than i had expected</li>
            <li> She said they both were in her mailbox, but one was in a package inside&lt;br /&gt;a package, and the other was in the inner package just laying in her mailbox.  </li>
            <li> but with this, it doesn&#x27;t hold it very long.</li>
            <li> The one that I got was the one pictured, not the black and white one that some others got.</li>
            <li> The clip on the back snapped in half.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for thin and/or fine hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a little flimsy and I can feel the flowers flexing a bit when I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair clip arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> The clip doesn&#x27;t stay as i expected it to.</li>
            <li> order this in October and expected delivery is November</li>
            <li> and it is big enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of black and silver colors, the actual item was black and GOLD.</li>
            <li> The clip is actually gold and black, not silver and black.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it is only one of the small ones at the end of the clip, and so is not all that noticeable, so</li>
            <li> At least once a week for the last 6 months</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it in silver &amp; black based colors.</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant to order anything from this seller because of the reviews, and because common sense says something coming from China will be difficult to communicate any order/purchase problems.</li>
            <li> If you planned to wear it on the side of your hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it because it&#x27;ll weigh you down and fall down your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for someone with black hair</li>
            <li> and i feel like they are going to fall out, but they haven&#x27;t yet, maybe i can replace them with some nicer less plastic looking ones.</li>
            <li> Again, the clip snapped in half.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, but these are too heavy to just clip my hair back.</li>
            <li> the stones will fall out if dropped, even from a small height, but if your careful with it...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> However it  clips in tight and is well made.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but I leave my hair down in the front, and make a bun on the crown and it is a clip, and holds a lot of hair, or a little in a bun.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little lighter as well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little heavy but does not draw away from using it....</li>
            <li> Very big and heavy for a hair clip!!!</li>
            <li> It has a heavy duty clip.</li>
            <li> and it may feel heavy.</li>
            <li> but so heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> Extremely heavy.</li>
            <li> Really heavy, you can not wear it in your hair</li>
            <li> Also, one of the stones is missing.</li>
            <li> how heavy.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair firmly.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy dealing with the seller and dropped it and have a clip that I did not order now.</li>
            <li> IT JUST A LITTLY HEAVY FOR MY HAIR,BUT</li>
            <li> Add a small black sequined or plain purse</li>
            <li> daughter got it this past weekend, Feb 8-9, and loves it.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably priced.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat heavy and requires thick hair for it to stay in.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and clunky.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, just so you know.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was under three bucks including shipping, hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> addition, the spring that it made with is very delicate and broke within a few attempts at clipping into place.</li>
            <li> But at least it arrived.</li>
            <li> My wife got this and would wear it at least once a month in her hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but thin; this piece is heavy.</li>
            <li> Holds well though I do not have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have thick hair it will work for you.  </li>
            <li> But there are (well there were a lot of other things wrong)  </li>
            <li> If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> It tangles my hair and is uncomfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> So now this is useless.</li>
            <li> Ill be buying from this seller again and again.</li>
            <li> and I got a stupid butterfly one instead.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it Bigger than it appeared</li>
            <li> Great item for the price. It arrived much sooner than the site said it would.</li>
            <li> It is heavy for my hair and not as pretty as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I imagined this to be smaller and lighter when I ordered it. It is neither of those things. But wow, it is beautiful. It&#x27;s heavy, good quality and so, so pretty. If you planned to wear it on the side of your hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it because it&#x27;ll weigh you down and fall down your hair. But above a ponytail, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very big and heavy for a hair clip!!!</li>
            <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use myself but give as gift to people who helps me on vacation.</li>
            <li> Quality was good, but it really is too big and heavy to wear comfortably in hair.  It is being used as a scarf clip instead!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful... thank you for such a exquisite piece of jewelry... it&#x27;s larger than i had anticipated and is a great addition to my collection</li>
            <li> Good heavy clip that holds well in the hair. It&#x27;s also very versatile.</li>
            <li> Very pretty item but heavy.  Only can be worn on back of head.</li>
            <li> Love this very much. Very good quality, sturdy, and lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this black hair&lt;br /&gt;Clip it goes good with different color&lt;br /&gt;Outfit. And its made strong so it will last longer. I used it all the time</li>
            <li> Very pretty and it is big enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love the pin, but I have to wear it on a jacket because it is far too heavy to wear in my thin, short hair. It&#x27;s about 4 inches long. My friends admire it, and I like telling them the price and how quickly I received it from China.</li>
            <li> Better quality clip, has long pins and all heavy metal for a sturdy hold. Very elegant looking in any color hair.  My favorite going out hair accessory. Add a small black sequined or plain purse and it is a nice look.</li>
            <li> quality at the right price</li>
            <li> Very pretty and I like the detail very much.  I got this as a gift for my Granddaughter.  Shipping was actually pretty fast.  It was  estimated sometime in August and I got it already (July 6th).</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and more beautiful than described and pictured.  I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  Makes an excellent gift and people will think you spent a lot more than you did!</li>
            <li> LOVELY!!!  Absolute top quality and appearance!!!  I will wear it proudly!</li>
            <li> Very heavy and clunky. It tangles my hair and is uncomfortable to wear.  Design is not as pretty as the photo implies.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED!!! ... BEAUTIFUL HAIR CLIP ... LONG WAIT TO BE SHIPPED, BUT, WORTH THE WAIT ... DEFINITELY ... !!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!  It is a bit heavy, but I leave my hair down in the front, and make a bun on the crown and it is a clip, and holds a lot of hair, or a little in a bun.  Beautiful design with black jewels and distressed-looking silver.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, just so you know. But worth it! It looks very Victorian. It will probably last me for forever!</li>
            <li> It is pretty and the quality is nice.  I found it to be light enough to wear without causing any pain as in most metal hair accessories.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty clip and works fairly well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a little flimsy and I can feel the flowers flexing a bit when I put it in my hair. As long as you&#x27;re gentle with it though, it should hold up alright.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  It took about 6 weeks to arrive which I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;plan on, it came from Hong Kong.  I found out all this when I wrote the seller about 2-3 weeks after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter got it this past weekend, Feb 8-9, and loves it.  She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  The clip is,&lt;br /&gt;I would describe it, like an alligators mouth, no teeth, opening, long prongs.  She said it stayed put too.&lt;br /&gt;It is so pretty.  I ordered her another one at the same time.  The seller I found out was the same person&lt;br /&gt;under a different &amp;#34;company name&amp;#34;.  She said they both were in her mailbox, but one was in a package inside&lt;br /&gt;a package, and the other was in the inner package just laying in her mailbox.  Both were in very good condtion.&lt;br /&gt;She was puzzled, but very happy with both.  I wonder if the seller mailed them both and one got separated&lt;br /&gt;some how but the mailman, knew and made sure they both got in her box.  Interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> I received these clips today 2/11/14.  They arrived two weeks before scheduled. They look exactly as pictured.  They are large and beautiful.  I try to order in pairs and am so glad I do.  I would purchase from this seller again.  Thank you for these beautiful clips.  I look forward to buyting more.</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> As pretty as pictured and I wear this very frequently. At least once a week for the last 6 months and it is still holding up!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, and nice quality piece of hair jewelry. Unbelievably priced. Took awhile to get here, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Beautifully crafted.  Great value.  This hair clip arrived sooner than expected.  Although a little heavy for use in an up-do, I find it makes an excellent clip for sweaters and shawls . . . maybe a nice present, too.</li>
            <li> beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li> The clip doesn&#x27;t stay as i expected it to. It slips out of my hair too easily. It is beautiful though</li>
            <li> Does not hold my hair at all. Falls down right away. Nice pin, but, unfortunately, absolutely  useless</li>
            <li> Works great as a hairpin, but the above display picture does not perfectly match what I got. Instead of black and silver colors, the actual item was black and GOLD. Still pretty, but definitely doesn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li> this is very well made for the price, holds hair in place and stays put with the tight holding clip. arrived quicker than i thought it would. i would def buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is the first black hair clip I have I have gotten compliments as to the beauty of the clip. You should make available more black and white. The combination of the two colors would be nice.</li>
            <li> gorgeous. very large and worth the price. cant wait to show it off in my hair. stunning detail on the item....</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better. If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It has a heavy duty clip. It also seems to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> This vintage hair clip is so attractive. Wear this one when  you are all dressed up, going out on the town. My hair clip came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a large hair clip, then don&#x27;t get this one. I mean it&#x27;s about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> The clip has one main flaw - it is really quite heavy.  So if you have fine or medium fine hair it is going to pull at your hair when you wear it.  It would work best for people with thick hair, and a lot of it.  Then it may be perfectly useful!</li>
            <li> This is another pretty barrette from China. The one I received was more gold-colored than in the photo, but is still gorgeous. It is a sturdy, well-made piece and has lots of bling and sparkle. It is nice to have a black one, since most of these barrettes are made in multi-colored designs, and this would be both more formal and business like. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This comb is very pretty and the center of the flower was clear crystal but didn&#x27;t look like that in the picture. Also doesn&#x27;t have enough teeth to hold into the hair for the weight of this comb so you have to still use a lot of pins first to hold both hair and clip up. It&#x27;s better to use to hold a curtain back for decoration. I probably won&#x27;t use it as much as I would have liked to but won&#x27;t return it because it comes from China through imports and was a inexpensive enough price. I don&#x27;t like using a lot of hair pins but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then this would be a good clip for you or if your hair isn&#x27;t as fine.</li>
            <li> This product took over a month to ship, although I was informed of this at checkout.  I think it&#x27;s very pretty and worth the cost and wait, but I am rating it with 3 stars because the metal is gold instead of silver like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but it&#x27;s very heavy. You couldn&#x27;t just clip it in your hair because it would fall out and probably pull some hair with it.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to see this product, and when it arrived I was very happy that is big, the jewels are nice, it holds all my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to do a lot, it just looks great. I&#x27;m very happy with it!!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. The click breoken  when first time use.</li>
            <li> This piece was much better quality than I expected for this price.  I really love wearing it and always receive nice comments about it.</li>
            <li> Love it is one of my best hair piece get a lot compliments Recommend to all my friends and adv them  where I got it from !!</li>
            <li> So very beautiful and arrived very quickly from Asia (China). I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I have dark brown hair and it looks really nice with my hair color. Super excited about wearing it to a wedding soon!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved wearing this for some formal occasions and the shipping was a lot faster than predicted.</li>
            <li> I love this hair piece,  it is very detailed and has weight to it. I have long, thick hair so it works great for me. For someone with fine or thin hair I can definitely see it falling out or pulling on their head and it may feel heavy. However it  clips in tight and is well made. I loved it so much I also bought a purple one kinda like it!</li>
            <li> Love this hair pin, got it a bit late. But at least it arrived. Very nice and classic design. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I got compliments on this. no complaints, very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty piece and probably meant for someone with thick hair.  I have a lot of hair but thin; this piece is heavy.</li>
            <li> Great price for a bold and beautful big hair clip. Holds well though I do not have thick hair. Love it</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was very well made or as attractive as the picture. It is golder and gaudier. It is somewhat heavy and requires thick hair for it to stay in.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip and looks more expensive than it is.  Can&#x27;t wait to dress up and wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair clip!!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the detail</li>
            <li> beautiful clip, many compliments</li>
            <li> Looks fine but is WAY too heavy. I did not know it was this big, it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short. So now this is useless.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. It looks so vintage you wouldn&#x27;t guess it wasn&#x27;t from the thirties. It is also very well made with a strong clip. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful  I love pretty things for my hair and this is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy more in different styles and colors!</li>
            <li> I like it but I wish I can just slip it on but I didn&#x27;t think it was big  and won&#x27;t stay on . You have to have your hair up or in a bun . And would like nice</li>
            <li> Larger and heavier than I expected but a very nice, elegant looking piece. Coming from China, my expectations were quite low, so I was pleasantly surprised at he quality.</li>
            <li> It is pretty,  and also pretty heavy.  Oh and after I got it (maybe a month or so later)  the pretty design wasn&#x27;t even attached to the clip well enough to stay on. I super glued it a few times then gave up on it.  But there are (well there were a lot of other things wrong)  I say it was and not that it does because it got  thrown away quickly.  The part where the alligator clip part was wouldn&#x27;t shut because it was completely crooked and it would just fall right out of my hair,  never had a chance to really wear it because,  well like I said,  the metal was crooked and the main design wouldn&#x27;t stay on,  and I guess for the account that it was crooked it would fall right out of my hair lol.  The saying is true.  You get what you paid for,  I wish it did work better,  because it is beautiful and I love unique style hair products.  Oh and btw I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the gas driving to the post office.  Maybe if you have thick hair it will work for you.  Good luck with your choices and if it would let me keep the stars blank,  I would have 😱💀</li>
            <li> Very large heavy duty clip. Perfect for thick long hair!</li>
            <li> I have long thick heavy hair, these are great &amp;#34;hair jewelry&amp;#34; to spice up your hair for any occasion where you need black</li>
            <li> These are really pretty but a little larger than picture shows should still be nice for my bridesmaids to wear for my wedding</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made! Love it!</li>
            <li> Loved the hair piece! I have super short hair and I was able to work with it. I had to use bobby pins to hold up the back bottom part of my hair but that&#x27;s because it is short.  The clip is strong and holds up all day as I use it a lot to work (office environment).  For a more casual look I&amp;#34;ll sometimes use a very light hair band on the front, twist the back side, clip and go.  I get lots of compliments too. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it in silver &amp; black based colors.</li>
            <li> The one that I got was the one pictured, not the black and white one that some others got. It is downright beautiful. It&#x27;s heavy, but not crazily so. It&#x27;s large, but not crazily so. I can imagine a number of places/times I would want to wear it. Seems like it should hold together well.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large clip, and it is a bit on the heavy side.  That said, it is really pretty and I am enjoying having it.</li>
            <li> Very showy &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34;, a beautiful Hair accessory. I bought two. I put my hair in a bun, and use these on both sides of the bun.&lt;br /&gt;They are big.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and I got a stupid butterfly one instead.I honestly do not like butterflies as much as you would think a woman does but anyways... the important part is they didnt fulfill my order correctly.</li>
            <li> Like many other bedazzled jewel hair clips, this one is decently heavy and requires somewhat thick hair. Its so beautiful though and is the only clip I found with a  neutral color palate. Lovely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Given the price, this hair clip is actually quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;It was under three bucks including shipping, hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is as one would expect, the back prongs don&#x27;t line up perfectly, and to be honest, like ALL similar clips, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked (and neither should you) if a percent of the metal is lead. Under three bucks, shipped from an unknown company in China, let&#x27;s be realistic here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is large and heavy. Not suitable for thin and/or fine hair. Perfect for long, thick, and coarse locks, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know what you&#x27;re getting, and this is a very nice item.</li>
            <li> VERY HEAVY!&lt;br /&gt;This cannot work on it&#x27;s to secure your and hair and would need to be used decoratively only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the spring that it made with is very delicate and broke within a few attempts at clipping into place.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Bent while just trying to open the claw.  Save your money.  You get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get to me but worth the wait... Beautiful and excellent quality</li>
            <li> Beautiful beautiful hair pin, very pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li> very nice for the money</li>
            <li> Good looking but so heavy it just falls right through. Unless you have a huge amount of hair it&#x27;s way to heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so well made.......it&#x27;s stunning........I LOVE IT!!!  And it was ONLY around $4.00  !!  I have bought MANY of this seller&#x27;s hair clips......GOOD STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> Thought it might be to big and gaudy, but it turned out to be great.  It is gold and black but very classy looking.  Am going to wear it for dinner on our cruises.</li>
            <li> This was beautiful! It has a lot more gold coloring on it than shows up in the photo but it looks very similar to the photo but even more beautiful! It&#x27;s a gift for someone with black hair and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up against her dark hair but with the gold it will stand out beautifully!</li>
            <li> It has a great grip and it sparkles beautifully! I love it even more in person than online!</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous and holds my hair great!!</li>
            <li> lovely, very exotic yet subtle enough for day wear</li>
            <li> I will be using this as a scarf clip and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Love the framework on this clip.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, its a little heavy but its nice, the little gems are kinda cheap and i feel like they are going to fall out, but they haven&#x27;t yet, maybe i can replace them with some nicer less plastic looking ones.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was not too jeweled and had a very strong clip.  This was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> This WAS a beautiful clip. I ordered 2 of them one for each side of my bun. On the third wearing one of them broke. The clip on the back snapped in half. I wrote to the company and after several exchanges, they agreed to replace it for free. The replacement arrived 20 days later and broke the first time I used it. Again, the clip snapped in half. I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal it&#x27;s made of but the stuff can&#x27;t take any pressure of any kind. I&#x27;m using them strictly as decoration in my hair, they are not under any pressure or holding much hair. Very pretty but very disappointing, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Item took almost a month to arrive.  I would not call it vintage either.  It is pretty though and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Super cute and awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice hair clip--seems to stay in quite well</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, this is sooo much lovelier in person then the foto.... it&#x27;s a little heavy but does not draw away from using it.... on the contrary.. I bought more!!!</li>
            <li> order this in October and expected delivery is November however i received it today, its cute and perfect, price couldn&#x27;t have been better. Thank you, i ordered another for my mom. Loved it</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant to order anything from this seller because of the reviews, and because common sense says something coming from China will be difficult to communicate any order/purchase problems. Seems to be a hit/miss kinda seller, but for this particular purchase I am very happy..&lt;br /&gt;The barrette/clip is strong enough to hold up all of my hair, which is about 2 /12&#x27; long, and very thick and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t silver like the picture, more of a gold (I will upload buyer photos in a second here), but it was honestly prettier in person than the picture showed. That surprised me so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 5*&#x27;s for sure, for my particular transaction.&lt;br /&gt;For the seller, mayyybe 2 stars, because I ordered a vintage vampire-styled choker necklace that came in the same package, and it was a completely different necklace than the one pictured when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all in your spendings!!</li>
            <li> Lovely but will not be able to use due to size and weight. Extremely heavy. Do not see how it could stay in anyone&#x27;s hair. Will give to my very creative daughter. Perhaps  she can repurpose it.</li>
            <li> Really heavy, you can not wear it in your hair</li>
            <li> this hair clip is beautiful, however, it&#x27;s so heavy, it slides out of my hair.  Too bad because it looks nice!</li>
            <li> Pretty but heavy for normal hair.</li>
            <li> Nice size very pretty</li>
            <li> This is absolutely gorgeous. I am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> It looks real good but is so heavy it woun&#x27;t stay in your hair. Would not recomend. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Great hair clip! The item took some time to arrive but arrived neatly packaged and undamaged. Hold hair very nicely. Got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Nice. It breaks easily, but good deal. Lasted a whole four weeks. It&#x27;s also pretty. Kind of heavy. Buying again because nice price.</li>
            <li> Daughter picked this out for the Mrs., Pretty sweet actually. Its bigger than I expected (approx. 4&amp;#34;) and nice details for probably being made with a chopstick and a 2000 year old ball peen  hammer. Solid, eye catching and a pleasant surprise for the money.. granted, expectations were low out of the gate.</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy but so pretty that it is worth the weight</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but came broken</li>
            <li> Kind of fell apart on me fast!!</li>
            <li> pretty but not a nice as it was in the picture. I wish it were a little lighter as well</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product, and while it is a beautiful piece, I am not as happy with the product as I could be. Firstly, the metal is not silver, it is gold colored. I was really hoping to get a black and silver piece. Also, one of the stones is missing. Fortunately, it is only one of the small ones at the end of the clip, and so is not all that noticeable, so I&#x27;m not going to try to return it. The item arrived sooner than I expected it, which was a nice surprise as I know things from overseas take longer to ship. It feels fairly secure in my hair, and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> The photo does not do this clip justice. Shiny and very elegant, it looked very nice in the back of my hair. No problem with it staying in, nice large piece.</li>
            <li> This items far exceeds my expectations, it is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase and it is truly a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> this was pretty but did not appeal to me like the others</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this slide is great when I wear my hair up -looks really good -the price was good for such a beautiful hair slide</li>
            <li> These clips are very pretty (I bought two) -- just like the picture, in nice shape with no crystals missing. I didn&#x27;t fully realize how big they would be, though, or more to the point, how heavy. I have thick curly hair, but these are too heavy to just clip my hair back. They work nicely to embellish a hairstyle, like a bun or French twist, but I need to use something else to secure my hair first.</li>
            <li> My wife got this and would wear it at least once a month in her hair. But about ten months in, the metal snapped on the back clip part, making it totally unusable. It is still very pretty and she plans on trying to recycle what is left in some way, but as the metal snapped it is totally unusable as a hair piece. Still, for the price, she was able to wear it over ten times with no problems. She got plenty of compliments on it, too.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but also very heavy. May not work well with thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> for the price, it is a sturdy, beautiful piece. the stones will fall out if dropped, even from a small height, but if your careful with it...</li>
            <li> Just as seen in photograph.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> It looks very cheap in person.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I really thought it looked pretty in the picture.  It is antique gold in color, and the gold edges around the black gems are much thicker than they look.  Also, the gems are a little smaller than the setting, so you can see that they don&#x27;t really fit right.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter. The clip is actually gold and black, not silver and black. There aren&#x27;t enough teeth to hold up it weight. The metal is very cheep and bends very easily. It is only pretty from afar.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very early with neat packing . I love it.  I wear them every weekend, and they&#x27;re still looking like they&#x27;ve just come out the box. They weren&#x27;t cheap at all but pretty!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  and the clip is nice and sturdy. Holds my hair firmly. Definitely recommend this product. I dont like gold but this clip is very pretty</li>
            <li> This hair clip looks so much better than the picture!</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful piece of hair clip, heavy and is stunning on.</li>
            <li> This piece is so lovely. I will most likely purchase another just because I am so in love with it. Just gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Thanks, really good quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This hair pin is quite lovely with a unique antigued look, very sturdy, and I&#x27;m anxious to wear it on that perfect special occasion.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the correct black flowered/rose hair clip and contacted the seller who e-mailed back an apparently cut and past/rehearsed response that to me personally was not satisfactory. I ordered 3 from the same seller and two of the clips were correct. My warning to you would be that you could receive a different hair clip than ordered. The seller will then ask for a photo with the package ... so save the package. I did not enjoy dealing with the seller and dropped it and have a clip that I did not order now. Beyond that I do feel the hair clips are of a good quality and who can beat the price?!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! But the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; on this is super weak and the clip itself is smooth (not toothed) so when i put my hair up in a but with this, it doesn&#x27;t hold it very long. If i shake my head around at all it comes out. It&#x27;s really beautiful, and i can wear it for short events, but i have to keep redoing my bun. Ok though, because it&#x27;s super cheap and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I not only use this as a hair piece but as a brooch as well . I get many compliments on it !</li>
            <li> I love this clip! It is a little on the heavy side, but I received tons of compliments on how pretty it was.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, lovely, exceptionally outstanding. I feel that I got more than my moneys worth. I wear it all the time and many I mean many people have commented on how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price.  It&#x27;s not cheaply made, but has significant weight to it.  I have very thick hair and it held it up just great without needing any other product.  Ill be buying from this seller again and again.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY PRETTY IT JUST A LITTLY HEAVY FOR MY HAIR,BUT IT WAS WORTH THE PRICE I PAID ;:</li>
            <li> pretty but heavy and large for fine hair. be great for think hair</li>
            <li> Mine had gold accents, somewhat cheap looking, but then again it is cheap to buy</li>
            <li> love it, so beautiful</li>
            <li> if you havent bought this hair clip and you use them you should get one its beautiful !!!!! the picture of it dosent do it justice...and it looks fantastic on bblonde hair..you wont regret getting one and it it would be great when ya want something for you hair when your dressing up for a special night.</li>
            <li> It looks very nice than it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> larger than i had expected</li>
            <li> Well made, quality hair clip.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hairpin with intricate leaves detail.</li>
            <li> Prettier in person than the picture reveals. Sparkles in your hair while providing control!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. The quality is perfect and the price is great</li>
