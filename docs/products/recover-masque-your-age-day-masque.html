            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>The pricing on this item is awesome &amp; affordable because it cost much more elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I have used Recover before and experienced amazing results.</li>
            <li>made face feel good but did not do what was advertised&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife love it so much, it&#x27;s great product, and price is good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the recover mask!</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>but she looked amazing afterward..</li>
            <li>I tried the masque originally from a distributor and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and maybe I need to do more than one application</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I had use this for about 6 months, since then I feel my skin much better, I had seen results, I agree with you guys, prices are to hight , but  that is why I buy as a preferred customer through - agent .....  </li>
            <li>If i could get it ,i need  more product of seacreat  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I feel gives a refreshing skin result that is noticeable.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>And the fact that you can get it here for such a CHEAP price is awesome!</li>
            <li>On top of that they make you feel obligated by staying overtime and giving you a special deal for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>but I did before and after pictures and did not see a huge difference</li>
            <li>There is a reason it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>We ordered overnight shipping to arrive before the photo shoot, but we paid mightily for shipping as well.  </li>
            <li>Recovery Masque age day Masque, which i love it and was the first of my order.</li>
            <li>And if I were to buy it online, I would only do so with the expectation that it may a good product but is no substitute for fillers, botox,  or surgery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Recover Masque and love it so much.</li>
            <li>I did a close up before and after and the difference was AMAZING, even weeks later.</li>

            <li>This product delivers...used it just before a photo shoot to help smoothe fine lines and it not only helped the fine lines, it even made the dark under eye circles better looking.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference...</li>
            <li>but then they did this whole sales pitch and my Christmas miracle has turned into a Christmas nighmare.  </li>

            <li>Is there anyone  who has actually used a whole box of the day and/or night masques as well as any of the other supportive products?  </li>
            <li>After speaking with him, I saw a new ad that was selling the Recover for about $349 but had not one review.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to that.</li>
            <li>They insisted their $800 product is not only lasting, but their natural ingredients are safe and that in the long run would save me higher ongoing costs of fillers, Botox and surgery.  </li>
            <li>and it did make my hands and arms feel very soft and</li>

            <li>and i had to return one of them because it was really old.</li>
            <li>I have used this before so I can tell this is really old.</li>
            <li>I am thinking the product must be old, and considering the price, it makes sense.</li>
            <li>Now a friend told me this is a multi-level company and this is why there is no quality control as far as expiration dates</li>
            <li>If this product is the Real Seacret and actually selling online for $40, there&#x27;s no way it is going to lift your face and soften wrinkles permanently.  </li>
            <li>Buyers Beware!is product is the Real Seacret and actually selling online for $40</li>
            <li>Even getting me to believe that I found special miracle product not available anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I saw the demo on youtube and that woman was majorly wrinkly</li>
            <li>I also want to add that I am 65 years old but often get mistaken for up to twenty years younger and don&#x27;t have deep lines or feel I have unreasonable expectations.  </li>
            <li>For the price, though I am not sure if it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product before and it was very creamy - this seemed a little dry, so it may have been old</li>

            <li> When I got home and looked up the Seacret products online Christmas Eve, all of the Recover Masques were selling for around $40 and average of 3 ½ star reviews from 11 people.</li>

            <li> The two sellers are from Israel and I trusted them when they showed me pictures of themselves at the Dead Sea with this mud on them</li>

It is unconscionable for them to tell me this is a permanent solution and an alternative to fillers and Botox.  I told them I had tried facials, Dermawand, Galvanic spa, and even Matrix laser and had reached the point where I felt the only answer would be fillers or Botox.  They insisted their $800 product is not only lasting, but their natural ingredients are safe and that in the long run would save me higher ongoing costs of fillers, Botox and surgery.

I&#x27;m very upset about this as all I originally was interested was the sea salt for this terrible mysterious itching on my upper arms.

            <li> My wife love it so much, it&#x27;s great product, and price is good. Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Love it I look 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> I feel bad for the people who weren&#x27;t as happy with their results as I was!! I LOVE the recover mask! I did a close up before and after and the difference was AMAZING, even weeks later. I know it drys much faster if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions and wet your face first (meaning your face is dripping, not just wiping with a damp towel). And the fact that you can get it here for such a CHEAP price is awesome! Compare it to the seacret site!! OUCH!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  You can see results immediately, I just wish my skin would look like that days later. I have used it twice a week for 4 weeks and am hoping I will see a longer effect. It does come out a little dry but it helps to massage the package before opening. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I had use this for about 6 months, since then I feel my skin much better, I had seen results, I agree with you guys, prices are to hight , but  that is why I buy as a preferred customer through - agent .....  seacretdirectkrose14.com  I had save a lot of dollars. I&#x27;m thinking to become an agent since I use this a lot.... Remember Always buy as a preferred customer you guys will save a lot of money 50% off on prices and you will make the order  yourself.  and seacret will ship it to your house. Try it this way... Hope,this help......  Seacretdirectkrose14.com</li>
            <li> I used Recover Masque and love it so much. Please may i know why i got my 2 order but couldn,t get Recovery Masque age day Masque, which i love it and was the first of my order. If i could get it ,i need  more product of seacreat  to order it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Happy holidays. Ziba Bavi</li>
            <li> This product is like a miracle mask because you can visibly see the difference once applied &amp; it lasts for a few days thereafter.  The pricing on this item is awesome &amp; affordable because it cost much more elsewhere.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and it was very creamy - this seemed a little dry, so it may have been old</li>
            <li> It is ok. For the price, though I am not sure if it is worth it. Maybe someone else has had a different result.</li>
            <li> I am not much on miracle products but this is pretty good. I can see and immediate difference after the use.</li>
            <li> I tried some of this with a tempered expectation. It didn&#x27;t live up to that. This stuff does absolutely NOTHING. A complete waste of money. It would be a waste of money at $1.00 per packet, much less over $20.00 per packet. Do not get caught up in the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; claims. Might as well use a wallyworld product.</li>
            <li> thr Seacret recovery mask a high quality anti-ageing mask that  I feel gives a refreshing skin result that is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried the masque originally from a distributor and loved it.  Decided to buy for MUCH less on amazon and am glad I did.  There are definite results seen after the masque peaks and it lasts.  I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> This product delivers...used it just before a photo shoot to help smoothe fine lines and it not only helped the fine lines, it even made the dark under eye circles better looking.  It makes your skin tight, plump, so very soft and more youthful looking.  I was impressed.  We ordered overnight shipping to arrive before the photo shoot, but we paid mightily for shipping as well.  Would we pay that shipping price again?  No.  Lesson learned, but would definitely order the product from shopquickonline again.</li>
