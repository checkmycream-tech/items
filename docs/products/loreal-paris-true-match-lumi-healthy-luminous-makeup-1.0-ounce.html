    <ol>
            <li>The best I have ever found is &amp;#34;really close&amp;#34;, but this is truly undetectable on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for makeup!</li>
            <li>This foundation is wonderful and makes you look youthful and moist.</li>
            <li>This foundation is great!</li>
            <li>Best yet, it cleans up my skin.  </li>
            <li>it blends perfectly with my skin and has a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>i love this product!!!  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look like I have on makeup, but just have incredible skin.</li>
            <li>It would probably work beautifully as a highlighting foundation too if you bought a shade lighter than your skin tone.</li>
            <li>This goes on so flawlessly and doesnt make my dryness more noticable!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great foundation.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect bendable color for me and gives a nice glow without looking overly sparkly.</li>
            <li>good product with great price ...</li>
            <li>Otherwise the texture and coverage are good and the finish is close to matte -</li>
            <li>This is good for any sort of coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great coverage if you choose to purchase a drug store product stays on longer than most.</li>
            <li>So great better then the TRU match foundation, this LUMI foundation goes on so nicely and blends well.</li>
            <li>First, it matches my skin tone perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Also it is a great price online and comes in lots of shades to fit your skintone (I&#x27;m neutral</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I love that I accidentally got another amount in a darker shade which I can use during tanning season lol</li>
            <li>It matches my skin really nice</li>
            <li>unless you wear concealer and powder with it, which is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I liked the look, feel and color of the foundation when applying it; however, after application, it was too &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; (read: shiny)</li>
            <li>you really get a flawless finish with it.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to get the neutral colorer and it matches well and adds a nice, not sparkly but</li>
            <li>I love love this foundation!</li>
            <li>This is nice, very light, but good coverage for a smooth and yet moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>skin honestly feels better while wearing this product.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for a natural look.</li>
            <li>This foundation leaves skin looking soft and flawless.  </li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>I have more oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I love applying it with my beauty sponge</li>
            <li>I love this foundation but</li>
            <li>Lumi by L&#x27;Oreal is my favorite drugstore foundation yet.  </li>
            <li>Better application when using a moisturizer underneath.  </li>
            <li>Glowing and healthy is how I would describe finish.  </li>
            <li>Either liquid foundations have come a long way or this stuff is truly awesome!  </li>
            <li>This foundation feels great on the skin and gives you a very dewy glow with light coverage that is buildable.</li>
            <li>This makeup is great, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I liked the powder foundations very much, but they couldn&#x27;t quite give me the coverage I seem to need more and more as I age.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it works better than a lot of the anti-aging foundations as it gives my skin a dewy look and doesn&#x27;t settle in any fine lines.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to blend in.</li>
            <li>This time, I got Classic Ivory, and it&#x27;s spot on, so I can write a fair review now..</li>
            <li>It was fine, but came without a cap.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure it is 5 stars just because it isn&#x27;t the best I have tried, just one of my top 5 faves.</li>
            <li>It has light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>Light to medium buildable coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and light in consistency, it doesn&#x27;t really get cakey from my experience.</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable with the assistance of the cosmetics counter to get the right color.</li>
            <li>Good coverage but more for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this once the weather is cooler.</li>
            <li>Applying it onto clean skin makes me look</li>
            <li>After using for one month, my skin is softer and completely clean.</li>
            <li>As a result, I don&#x27;t wear foundation every day, but I do like it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I like light coverage and have very fair skin, red hair, blue eyes.</li>
            <li>It is very build-able and has light to full coverage.  </li>
            <li>it really makes your skin look like its glowing!!  </li>
            <li>I probably would have been able to get a more accurate color in-store, so I won&#x27;t rate it down for that, since I like the product itself.</li>
            <li>I am a nw 20 in mac makeup, I wear their sheer pressed powder; this foundation is really runny in the good way</li>
            <li>Soft glow but not over the top shimmer</li>
            <li>i like to use my beauty blender, or my flat top kabuki brush to apply it!  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite drug store product.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the app selection a try but wasn&#x27;t convinced it was the right color.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Imagine clean air gently surrounding your faceâ€”that is what this foundation feels like.</li>
            <li>It does settle into creases a little bit but overall, the best makeup find yet in years!</li>
            <li>It is a thin foundation and gives medium coverage which may not be good for some people but on my combination skin it works great as it doesn&#x27;t dry out or leave my looking cakey.</li>
            <li>A little cakey if layering on spots but still good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d totally recommend this, because you won&#x27;t get better quality foundation for the price.</li>
            <li>It can be used with higher coverage foundations and concealers and blends well.</li>
            <li>Overall like :)</li>
            <li>On really hot summer days, I get oily</li>
            <li>Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday.</li>
            <li>Feels good, not too heavy, didn&#x27;t make me break out with any acne.</li>
            <li>An improvement on the original True Match, but not as lasting as professional quality makeup.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel that it was very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage of this foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very well and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>It also matched my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product is very watery, and feels like nothing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>Later in the day, though, it left me looking kind of haggard and</li>
            <li>Just a little more oily than i like</li>
            <li>It layers on top of itself without caking or looking heavy if you need a little more coverage here and there.  </li>
            <li>First day I used two pumps, second day I used one pump and received a compliment on my &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin so am only layering a second pump for evenings when I want a more made up look.</li>
            <li>i could tell this product had been used before, i don&#x27;t appreciate that since it&#x27;s advertised as new, so everyone beware of that</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and was disappointed in the soft ivory/classic ivory color combination which was closer to classic ivory.</li>
            <li>and I bought the soft ivory).</li>
            <li>The texture is much heavier and the color was not a good match to the original soft ivory.</li>
            <li>The color I chose was soft ivory, which is a little too light for my complexion, but now I know to increase the tone for my next purchase.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit darker and yellow-ier than expected, but I made it work by mixing it with another foundation that was too light and pink.</li>
            <li>It is far too simple to use to not have a cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was very little foundation left on my face at the end of the day, while my eye makeup was still very noticeable (though it too showed signs of wear from the intense weather we&#x27;re having here this</li>
            <li>The actual product was fine, but the seller has yet to respond to my complaint.</li>
            <li>Even though I was really careful taking off my shirt and putting it back on, the foundation still rubbed off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, for as over-dewy as it looked and felt when newly applied, my face was dry and drawn by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this color after returning it in creamy natural after the revlon naked foundation broke me out, because creamy natural seemed too dark for me.</li>

            <li> I bought this color after returning it in creamy natural after the revlon naked foundation broke me out, because creamy natural seemed too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered what should be something close to my natural shade but by the end of the day I was a little darker.</li>
            <li> I found the L&#x27;Oreal Dream Lumi a little TOO luminous, even for my dry skin, because I had to use shine sheets on several areas of my face before I even left the house.</li>
            <li> and a little bit goes a long way so you are not constantly having to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I typically always used a matte foundation however with my dry skin it always settled in my dry patches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $3.50 cheaper than what I paid for the other color in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hyper-pigmentation due to sun</li>
            <li> I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Foundation once before, but I bought the wrong shade for me because I was lazy and had tried to guess it..</li>
            <li> so it makes me look almost sweaty but nothing a little powder can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Bought for sister to mix with Lumi W3, because it was too dark for her!</li>
            <li> Maybe just a little bit.</li>
            <li> but it is buildable and does not feel cakey or heavy on my skin which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin a bit for whatever reason...</li>
            <li> I live in a small beach town where the look is casual and I&#x27;m retired, so I no longer have to get dressed up for work every day.</li>
            <li> I usually wear LancÃ´me, EstÃ©e lauder or smash box foundation.</li>

            <li> This is nice, very light, but good coverage for a smooth and yet moisturizing effect.  I love it, second time I have purchasedd this, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good coverage but more for dry skin. I have more oily skin so it makes me look almost sweaty but nothing a little powder can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Bought for sister to mix with Lumi W3, because it was too dark for her!</li>
            <li> I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Foundation once before, but I bought the wrong shade for me because I was lazy and had tried to guess it.. This time, I got Classic Ivory, and it&#x27;s spot on, so I can write a fair review now..&lt;br /&gt;My skin honestly feels better while wearing this product. Imagine clean air gently surrounding your faceâ€”that is what this foundation feels like. I love this product, and I love that I accidentally got another amount in a darker shade which I can use during tanning season lol</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation because I heard a lot through YouTube makeup stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this foundation is NOT for oily skin. I guess I should have realized that was the &amp;#34;lumi&amp;#34; part of it. Applying it onto clean skin makes me look I just ran a marathon.</li>
            <li> I bought this color after returning it in creamy natural after the revlon naked foundation broke me out, because creamy natural seemed too dark for me. I am a nw 20 in mac makeup, I wear their sheer pressed powder; this foundation is really runny in the good way so it&#x27;s easy to blend in. It&#x27;s $3.50 cheaper than what I paid for the other color in a drugstore. It matches my skin really nice and it&#x27;s hard to tell you have makeup on unless you wear concealer and powder with it, which is nice so it&#x27;s perfect for a natural look.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit darker and yellow-ier than expected, but I made it work by mixing it with another foundation that was too light and pink. I probably would have been able to get a more accurate color in-store, so I won&#x27;t rate it down for that, since I like the product itself. It is nice and light in consistency, it doesn&#x27;t really get cakey from my experience.</li>
            <li> I received mine from Palm Beach Surplus. It was fine, but came without a cap. It is far too simple to use to not have a cap. The actual product was fine, but the seller has yet to respond to my complaint.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation because of all the rave reviews it has received. I agree that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a great foundation. It is not matte which is what I wanted for a dewy/satin finish. Even though I have an oily t-zone, I still bought it and combat the oil in that area by applying some powder. Also it is a great price online and comes in lots of shades to fit your skintone (I&#x27;m neutral and I bought the soft ivory). It has light to medium coverage but it is buildable and does not feel cakey or heavy on my skin which is a plus. I&#x27;d totally recommend this, because you won&#x27;t get better quality foundation for the price.</li>
            <li> I live in a small beach town where the look is casual and I&#x27;m retired, so I no longer have to get dressed up for work every day. As a result, I don&#x27;t wear foundation every day, but I do like it for special occasions. I found the L&#x27;Oreal Dream Lumi a little TOO luminous, even for my dry skin, because I had to use shine sheets on several areas of my face before I even left the house. Later in the day, though, it left me looking kind of haggard and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at a department store trying on clothes an hour or two before I wrote this review and discovered foundation stains on the collar of my shirt. Even though I was really careful taking off my shirt and putting it back on, the foundation still rubbed off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was very little foundation left on my face at the end of the day, while my eye makeup was still very noticeable (though it too showed signs of wear from the intense weather we&#x27;re having here this week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked the look, feel and color of the foundation when applying it; however, after application, it was too &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; (read: shiny) and I didn&#x27;t feel that it was very long-lasting. Finally, for as over-dewy as it looked and felt when newly applied, my face was dry and drawn by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.25 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Amazon wouldn&#x27;t accept my video review. You can find it on my YouTube beauty and skin care channel. The link is in my profile.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage of this foundation. The color I chose was soft ivory, which is a little too light for my complexion, but now I know to increase the tone for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe just a little bit. Maybe I&#x27;m the only one that could possibly notice the subtlety, but I  am approaching 40 and think this helps. Soft glow but not over the top shimmer</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. I have very pale skin so have had a lot of trouble in the past finding foundations that don&#x27;t make me look yellow and give me awful lines. This is the perfect bendable color for me and gives a nice glow without looking overly sparkly. It is a thin foundation and gives medium coverage which may not be good for some people but on my combination skin it works great as it doesn&#x27;t dry out or leave my looking cakey. It can be used with higher coverage foundations and concealers and blends well. It would probably work beautifully as a highlighting foundation too if you bought a shade lighter than your skin tone. In my opinion it works better than a lot of the anti-aging foundations as it gives my skin a dewy look and doesn&#x27;t settle in any fine lines. I have bought this several times and definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> As a woman who turned 40 this year I am fighting with aging skin with the additional aggravation of having occasional bouts of acne.  I moved away from liquid foundations when the Powder foundations were all the rave.  I liked the powder foundations very much, but they couldn&#x27;t quite give me the coverage I seem to need more and more as I age.  I have lots of hyper-pigmentation due to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reluctantly started looking into going back to Liquid foundations and tried this one.  WOW!  Either liquid foundations have come a long way or this stuff is truly awesome!  First, it matches my skin tone perfectly.  I have never had this happen with any foundation liquid or powder.  The best I have ever found is &amp;#34;really close&amp;#34;, but this is truly undetectable on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very well and stays on all day.  It layers on top of itself without caking or looking heavy if you need a little more coverage here and there.  It has no smell, comes in a pump (yeah!) and a little bit goes a long way so you are not constantly having to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer wince at the thought of putting liquid foundation on every day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for makeup! I recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin or a combination it&#x27;s not the product for you. It&#x27;s great coverage if you choose to purchase a drug store product stays on longer than most.</li>
            <li> Oh, L&#x27;Oreal Lumi, where have you been all my life?  My pores finally don&#x27;t look like craters, my acne is covered without looking like I used plaster to conceal, and it&#x27;s not too matte and not too moist.  I can throw on just a couple of drops before heading to the store in my yoga pants (aka Mom pants) and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have on makeup, but just have incredible skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation is wonderful and makes you look youthful and moist.</li>
            <li> This foundation is great! I typically always used a matte foundation however with my dry skin it always settled in my dry patches. So one say i decided to change it up! This goes on so flawlessly and doesnt make my dryness more noticable! I would also so it is a medium coverage and is buildable. It also matched my skin tone very well. I love applying it with my beauty sponge</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin a bit for whatever reason... maybe it was just me? Overall like :)</li>
            <li> Just a little more oily than i like</li>
            <li> I was looking for a placement for the discontinued L&#x27;Oreal Translucide. The texture is much heavier and the color was not a good match to the original soft ivory. I have very fair skin and was disappointed in the soft ivory/classic ivory color combination which was closer to classic ivory. I would not reorder this product.</li>
            <li> i could tell this product had been used before, i don&#x27;t appreciate that since it&#x27;s advertised as new, so everyone beware of that</li>
            <li> i love this product!!!  it really makes your skin look like its glowing!!  The consistency of the product is very watery, and feels like nothing on your skin.  It is very build-able and has light to full coverage.  i like to use my beauty blender, or my flat top kabuki brush to apply it!  you really get a flawless finish with it.  i have been using this product only for a couple of days, and i can already see a difference in my faces complexion and skin tone.</li>
            <li> An improvement on the original True Match, but not as lasting as professional quality makeup. Good for everyday.</li>
            <li> I never buy  foundation at the drugstore,  I feel more comfortable with the assistance of the cosmetics counter to get the right color. I usually wear LancÃ´me, EstÃ©e lauder or smash box foundation. I saw an ad for the loreal tru match app and clicked to download. I came up with w5 sand beige based on the questions but  I would have selected the n6.  I decided to give the app selection a try but wasn&#x27;t convinced it was the right color.  I purchased at drugstore instead of Amazon so it would be easier to exchange. To my surprise the color  was spot on! It literally disappears into my skin. I apply with a foundation brush. First day I used two pumps, second day I used one pump and received a compliment on my &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin so am only layering a second pump for evenings when I want a more made up look. The quality of this foundation is the same as dept store brands at a third of the price!</li>
            <li> This makeup is great, very natural looking. It blends in with your skin like you are not wearing any makeup but still covers flaws.</li>
            <li> This foundation feels great on the skin and gives you a very dewy glow with light coverage that is buildable. On really hot summer days, I get oily so I&#x27;d rather look matte. I&#x27;m excited to try this once the weather is cooler. Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation but their color matching tool is off. I ordered what should be something close to my natural shade but by the end of the day I was a little darker. Otherwise the texture and coverage are good and the finish is close to matte - almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t make me break out, didn&#x27;t make my face greasy - I think I just need a lighter share perhaps.</li>
            <li> This is good for any sort of coverage. I like light coverage and have very fair skin, red hair, blue eyes. So I decided to get the neutral colorer and it matches well and adds a nice, not sparkly but....brightness to my skin. Feels good, not too heavy, didn&#x27;t make me break out with any acne. I like it but I am not sure it is 5 stars just because it isn&#x27;t the best I have tried, just one of my top 5 faves.</li>
            <li> Lumi by L&#x27;Oreal is my favorite drugstore foundation yet.  I have used at least 6 very expensive department store brands and this one for $9 beats them all.  Light to medium buildable coverage.  This foundation leaves skin looking soft and flawless.  Just the right amount of shimmer.  Better application when using a moisturizer underneath.  Glowing and healthy is how I would describe finish.  Best yet, it cleans up my skin.  Not one breakout! It seriously repairs my skin.  After using for one month, my skin is softer and completely clean. A miracle.  A little cakey if layering on spots but still good. It does settle into creases a little bit but overall, the best makeup find yet in years!</li>
            <li> So great better then the TRU match foundation, this LUMI foundation goes on so nicely and blends well.</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> I love love this foundation! it blends perfectly with my skin and has a dewy finish. I also use MAC foundations but L&#x27;Oreal is my go to. By far my favorite drug store product.</li>
