            <li>Best of all, it smells like summer all year long!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin &amp; has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Use as a full body lotion and the best facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this happened because the product is old, or what, but as happy as I was to find the product I will not be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong with the coconut.</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite body butter ever!</li>
            <li>this lotion is amazing and it gives your skin a soft healthy feel and look.</li>
            <li>This is a really quality product for an amazingly affordable price.</li>
            <li>This product leaves a light coconut scent to the skin that is just heavenly.   </li>
            <li>When it was no longer available there, I found it online.</li>
            <li>It not only smells great</li>
            <li>It is so smooth</li>
            <li>I would recommend for someone looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this body butter smells great and lasts a long time and it makes the skin very soft</li>
            <li>Wonderful - especially for those of us who live in one of the five driest cities in the United States!</li>
            <li>When I found this I was so excited, but upon receiving it my excitement disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for dry skin in winter, and spring, summer, fall.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep my skin silky soft all day, the delicious coconut fragrance reminds me of being on a tropical island in the summer.</li>
            <li>Great for my dry winter skin</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of other products and know for a fact that I rate Delon Intense Moisturizing Body Butter as the very best product for me.</li>
            <li>This company also makes scrubs and full body care.  </li>
            <li>Recently a friend was visiting from Europe and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and fresh, but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Worthy it for the price</li>
            <li>It got here really quickly.</li>
            <li>Lightweight moisturizer that has a lasting fragrance which isn&#x27;t over powering, nice light smell.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Received quickly</li>
            <li>This body butter is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>So nice and smooth on dry skin.</li>
            <li>get so many compliments on the smell as well as how soft my skin in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely worn it without receiving a compliment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, smooth texture feels cool and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and everybody is always complimenting me on how I smell.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about a moisturizer that goes on smooth, is not greasy and smells so faintly of summer and so good that people ask : &amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li>Also the smell of coconut puts me right back in the tropics where I would most like to be.</li>
            <li>First tried product from Costco which turned out to be a seasonal item.  </li>
            <li>As soon as he gets low, we order more.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product, this is my second time ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>First bought it at Costco.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s nice on skin and the smell last for long, I would definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Smelled this in the gym, tracked it down, got the name, bought it and love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive brands but this one at a lower price is just as good.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling, but thin, more like a lotion that a &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it absorbs well, has alleviated my dry, itchy hotspots</li>
            <li>A real steal</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend goes NUTS and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>This is body butter really smells like coconuts and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>Also it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Instantly our skin became velvety smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; It has a nice scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>Mild, lasting scent</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and have ordered and used it for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>Use right after getting out of the shower and skin is not dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars because it has a few added chemicals, but is largely one of the most natural products of this type that I found that still does the job.</li>
            <li>This body butter replenishes moisture and doesn&#x27;t disappear leaving only a cloying scent like so many other brands.</li>
            <li>I put a piece of clear tape over it</li>
            <li>If not rubbed in completely it leaves a shine.</li>
            <li>After you put it on it soaks in and leaves a soft non-greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Very slight and pleasant but enough that other people comment on the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will use no other!</li>
            <li>I live outside in the summer and consequently get lots of exposure to sun, wind, etc.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate this five stars is because I wish they would fill the container completely.</li>
            <li>I am 49, and have spent much time outdoors.</li>
            <li>They are smooth, thick and not as overpowering as the ones from the mall stores.</li>
            <li>No dry skin ever!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I live in the Sonoran Desert and we are dealing with dry skin all year.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin subtle better than any other cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this happened because the product is old, or what, but as happy as I was to find the product I will not be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>

            <li> When I found this I was so excited, but upon receiving it my excitement disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin in winter, and spring, summer, fall.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep my skin silky soft all day, the delicious coconut fragrance reminds me of being on a tropical island in the summer.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry winter skin</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other products and know for a fact that I rate Delon Intense Moisturizing Body Butter as the very best product for me.</li>
            <li> This company also makes scrubs and full body care.  </li>
            <li> Recently a friend was visiting from Europe and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and fresh, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Worthy it for the price</li>
            <li> It got here really quickly.</li>

            <li> Received quickly</li>
            <li> This body butter is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> So nice and smooth on dry skin.</li>
            <li> get so many compliments on the smell as well as how soft my skin in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely worn it without receiving a compliment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, smooth texture feels cool and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and everybody is always complimenting me on how I smell.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about a moisturizer that goes on smooth, is not greasy and smells so faintly of summer and so good that people ask : &amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li> Also the smell of coconut puts me right back in the tropics where I would most like to be.</li>
            <li> First tried product from Costco which turned out to be a seasonal item.  </li>
            <li> As soon as he gets low, we order more.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this is my second time ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> First bought it at Costco.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s nice on skin and the smell last for long, I would definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Smelled this in the gym, tracked it down, got the name, bought it and love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive brands but this one at a lower price is just as good.  </li>
            <li> Nice smelling, but thin, more like a lotion that a &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it absorbs well, has alleviated my dry, itchy hotspots</li>
            <li> A real steal</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend goes NUTS and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> This is body butter really smells like coconuts and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Also it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Instantly our skin became velvety smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; It has a nice scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> Mild, lasting scent</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and have ordered and used it for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> Use right after getting out of the shower and skin is not dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because it has a few added chemicals, but is largely one of the most natural products of this type that I found that still does the job.</li>
            <li> This body butter replenishes moisture and doesn&#x27;t disappear leaving only a cloying scent like so many other brands.</li>
            <li> I put a piece of clear tape over it</li>
            <li> If not rubbed in completely it leaves a shine.</li>
            <li> After you put it on it soaks in and leaves a soft non-greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Very slight and pleasant but enough that other people comment on the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will use no other!</li>
            <li> I live outside in the summer and consequently get lots of exposure to sun, wind, etc.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate this five stars is because I wish they would fill the container completely.</li>
            <li> I am 49, and have spent much time outdoors.</li>
            <li> They are smooth, thick and not as overpowering as the ones from the mall stores.</li>
            <li> No dry skin ever!  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I live in the Sonoran Desert and we are dealing with dry skin all year.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin subtle better than any other cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I live on the Big Island where there is lots of sun, surf and harsh exposure to the skin...</li>
            <li> The rating of 4 stars is only because the 4 pack was only for coconut and did not include the other 3 varieties.</li>
            <li> it keeps me moisturized for long periods of time without feeling too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I put it on immediately after showing, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We will continue to use Delon as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> moisturizes my body all day long.</li>
            <li> You know those little bumps you get on the outside of your thighs and outside of your arms, and sometimes on the rear?</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter/cold months.  </li>
            <li> was a little ink stamp on bottom of each container which came off on my white sink counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just a normal to weak lotion.  </li>
            <li> Overall a disappointment, but not so much so that I won&#x27;t continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I have used cream all over my body every day of my life, and I have what I would call mediterranean skin, but not too dark.</li>
            <li> If you turn it upside down it would all run out.  </li>
            <li> The feel and density are decidedly less than before.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cream in a dusty little shop in my building this winter, and I got it because I couldn&#x27;t get to the CVS for my regular brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe it&#x27;s the seal around the container that&#x27;s creating this problem.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel like silk..</li>
            <li> Use this product year round.</li>
            <li> Never had this in previous shipments!</li>
            <li> Sadly, when I informed the seller, my concern was disregarded and here I am telling the public.  </li>
            <li> Use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Thrird order in the past  7  months</li>
            <li> I have used this Body Butter for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> The cream is luxurious and thick.  </li>
            <li> It used to be thick and creamy</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> A little inconvenient!  </li>
            <li> I would be so sad if it did.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Costco did not carry it again this year</li>
            <li> and it can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to learn that the 4 containers had no coconut smell.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but this bash (all four) smell awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about a moisturizer that goes on smooth, is not greasy and smells so faintly of summer and so good that people ask : &amp;#34;Does anyone else smell coconut?&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I have bought this product for years at a store and LOVED it . When it was no longer available there, I found it online. I will not order it again. The feel and density are decidedly less than before. Not worth the money for me.</li>

            <li> I am 49, and have spent much time outdoors. It is so moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily. The smell is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t go away. Very slight and pleasant but enough that other people comment on the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; fragrance. I never let myself run out. Love this body butter!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, bought it for my mom but kept 1 for myself! Quick shipping and pretty great price!</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff, a co-worker got it for me years ago for Christmas and I am just thrilled I finally found it and at an awesome price here on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order more soon , i love it smell so good and the price its okay too. So may be i will buy some for my friends :)</li>
            <li> I love this body butter! I&#x27;d been looking everywhere for a moisturizer with a coconut sent and this is it. Not only does it keep my skin silky soft all day, the delicious coconut fragrance reminds me of being on a tropical island in the summer. Everyone comments on how they love it!</li>
            <li> I discovered this cream in a dusty little shop in my building this winter, and I got it because I couldn&#x27;t get to the CVS for my regular brand. I was ASTOUNDED at the effect of this cream. You know those little bumps you get on the outside of your thighs and outside of your arms, and sometimes on the rear? Well, GONE. They are GONE. My skin has never felt like this. And the smell? I walk into a room and people are like, &amp;#34;mmmm! what is that..?&amp;#34; And when they find it&#x27;s me, they are like, what is that??? I have used cream all over my body every day of my life, and I have what I would call mediterranean skin, but not too dark. And I will never use anything else. The smell is amazing, the texture is thick, but you can regulate it if its too thick for you. I have already shared this with 5 women at my work who were like, what is that?? So. Amazing product. Great find.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of body butter, but in my opinion, this is the best body butter I&#x27;ve ever used, which is why I keep ordering it online.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong with the coconut. Next time I&#x27;ll buy Vanilla.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Use right after getting out of the shower and skin is not dry and itchy. Great value</li>
            <li> I love this body butter, It&#x27;s nice on skin and the smell last for long, I would definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I like it, great value for money and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I prefer the pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone that tries this will love how good it feels on your skin and how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li> I keep buying the body butter because so many friends and family take one, I need to replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is great. Still would like lower price</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; price</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body butter but this bash (all four) smell awful. Sadly, when I informed the seller, my concern was disregarded and here I am telling the public.  I firmly believe it&#x27;s the seal around the container that&#x27;s creating this problem.</li>
            <li> Here is Delon body butter.  This company also makes scrubs and full body care.  Ingredients are the best.  I will use no other!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this lotion is amazing and it gives your skin a soft healthy feel and look. The scent is clean and fresh, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and pricing</li>
            <li> I love this body butter.  I have tried more expensive brands but this one at a lower price is just as good.  Great for my dry winter skin and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  They give it a 5.</li>
            <li> Wonderful - especially for those of us who live in one of the five driest cities in the United States!</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever - and at a reasonable price. Non-greasy, absorbs into the skin, not sticky feeling and moisturizes all day. Use as a full body lotion and the best facial moisturizer on the market. Mango and olive oil versions are equally good.</li>
            <li> I had bought this body butter from Costco last year during the holiday season and thought it was the best body lotion I had ever purchased.  Unfortunately Costco did not carry it again this year and I was very disappointed.  When I found this I was so excited, but upon receiving it my excitement disappeared.  The lotion is like water.  If you turn it upside down it would all run out.  This is definitely not the same consistency as the ones I purchased from Costco.  I don&#x27;t know if this happened because the product is old, or what, but as happy as I was to find the product I will not be purchasing it again.  Not the same as what was distributed to Costco.</li>
            <li> I live on the Big Island where there is lots of sun, surf and harsh exposure to the skin...I use this butter on my body as well as my face and like it because it has a low melting point and does not leave skin feeling greasy...try the olive oil butter too!</li>
            <li> These are the most rich and great smelling body butters out there. They are smooth, thick and not as overpowering as the ones from the mall stores. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this cream all the time.  It keeps skin subtle better than any other cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> All of the body butter is stuck to the lid and top of container instead of the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> Body butter by Delon is just perfect for my skin. I have tried lots of other products and know for a fact that I rate Delon Intense Moisturizing Body Butter as the very best product for me. Also the smell of coconut puts me right back in the tropics where I would most like to be.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; It has a nice scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  It&#x27;s also just a normal to weak lotion.  Not even close to &amp;#34;intense moisturizing&amp;#34; as it is marketed.  Overall a disappointment, but not so much so that I won&#x27;t continue to use it.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just the best coconut butter around! Love it</li>
            <li> Heavenly smell (unless someone hates vanilla) that lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve rarely worn it without receiving a compliment. It&#x27;s very creamy.  Use a small amount.  If not rubbed in completely it leaves a shine.</li>
            <li> This is The Best stuff. Non greasy, Good Smelling All Body ageing protector. I use it also as aftershave.</li>
            <li> Buy these for gifts because you will love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer - it is the best.  I was given some of this almost 10 years ago, and since then, I buy it online since I can&#x27;t find it in a nearby store.  It is wonderful and works on my skin like no other moisturizer.  I love the smell and the feel.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I live outside in the summer and consequently get lots of exposure to sun, wind, etc. This body butter replenishes moisture and doesn&#x27;t disappear leaving only a cloying scent like so many other brands. I highly recommend this product and have ordered and used it for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> Yummy coconut. This is a great product and the quantity is  well worth the price!</li>
            <li> love this product, best body butter out there</li>
            <li> I so love this body butter.  I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel like silk..Also, i get so many comments on how good I smell. I use the coconut because it makes me think of Hawaii.  I had to get some more because all my grandkids wanted some.  They love it too..</li>
            <li> I can not get enough of this body lotion. It is so smooth and I feel/smell it hours after I put it on. This is my favorite brand of body lotion!</li>
            <li> The BEST lotion ever. My boyfriend goes NUTS and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream, fabulous scent.  First bought it at Costco.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thrird order in the past  7  months</li>
            <li> Love this product! I put it on immediately after showing, lasts a long time. I get lots of compliments on the scent!</li>
            <li> The body butter is amazing.  I get compliments all the time on the coconut scent.  The service was great.  It got here really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Leave my skin so smooth and smells wonderful. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is body butter really smells like coconuts and smells heavenly. Use this product year round. Great moisturizer and really smells just like coconuts! I love it!</li>
            <li> Lightweight moisturizer that has a lasting fragrance which isn&#x27;t over powering, nice light smell.  I would recommend for someone looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the butter has changed.  It used to be thick and creamy and I could smell it all day on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s waxy and the scent goes away immed.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, but thin, more like a lotion that a &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was instantly hooked.. It&#x27;s silky, smooth texture feels cool and makes skin super soft. And the coconut smell is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! And you have the best prices, too!!</li>
            <li> Good price. Quick shipment. This lotion is the best there is and it can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this body butter smells great and lasts a long time and it makes the skin very soft</li>
            <li> Smelled this in the gym, tracked it down, got the name, bought it and love it! great texture as well as smell, creamy but not greasy or gooey; soaks in immediately.</li>
            <li> Love it! best body butter ever</li>
            <li> IT WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. AND AT A GOOD PRICE TOO!</li>
            <li> Love this..keep on hand for gifts! Received quickly</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is;&lt;br /&gt;There was a little ink stamp on bottom of each container which came off on my white sink counter. I put a piece of clear tape over it but now I have to do that to 8 tubs of this. A little inconvenient!  Yes! I love how this makes my skin feel. Smells fantastic! I hope who ever placed this stamp on changes for future sales. Never had this in previous shipments! I have used this Body Butter for at least 3 years. Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I am using the coconut body butter 3 years now, every time After shower. I love the consistency and the smell. Also it moisturizes very well. Recently a friend was visiting from Europe and she loved it. So I gave her one jar. I am recommending this product</li>
            <li> My daughter and I live in the Sonoran Desert and we are dealing with dry skin all year. I bought these for my daughter and I about a month ago.  We both agree this moisturizing cream is the best we have ever used.  Instantly our skin became velvety smooth and hydrated.  The hydration and fragrance lasts all day as well. We will continue to use Delon as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite body butter ever!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Mild, lasting scent</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. I love it! I have ordered it before.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li> This is some of the best body moisturizer I have ever used:  it absorbs well, has alleviated my dry, itchy hotspots, seems to last a good while, and...smells great, course I like anything coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave it 4 stars because it has a few added chemicals, but is largely one of the most natural products of this type that I found that still does the job.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell and texture of this stuff! I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> i love it. the best moisturizer that i have ever used. both for body and face. it seems to melt into your skin and yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion! It soaks right in and everybody is always complimenting me on how I smell. It is not oily at all!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream....one of the best if not the best !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my body all day long.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizing cremes and by far this is the best.  After you put it on it soaks in and leaves a soft non-greasy feeling.</li>
