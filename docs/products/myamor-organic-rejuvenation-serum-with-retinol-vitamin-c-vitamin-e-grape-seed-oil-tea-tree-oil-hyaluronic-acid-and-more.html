            <li>and I love that is very affordable.</li>

            <li>This is my first week trying this product and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>My face is more radiant, fresh, hydrated and looking younger,  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel fresh and leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li>When I saw Myrka Dellanos talking about Myamor I new that it has to be a super product, one of my daughters bought me the Myamor Organic Rejuvenation Serum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing feeling, and also we all need to use retinal constantly on our skin to stay young and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes on my skin so can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li>Thanks myamor</li>
            <li>If you really know me you would know I never do.  </li>
            <li>and it is fantastic my face looks younger and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My cutis feels so much softer and looks so much brighter despite the fact that I just started using it, so it gives you results fasts.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended to me by two friends.</li>
            <li>Able to use it everyday</li>
            <li>Myamor serum is definitely organic with a fresh and citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all women and men who want to look young and vibrant.</li>
            <li>like trying out new products from Amazon because if I don&#x27;t like it I can always return it with no problems.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a pump so its easy to put a few dabs on your finger.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable and u see results fast Compare to other ones I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>but when your husband keeps staring at you with a slightly malicious smile and asks you what you have been doing different because he likes your new glow</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell and you feel your skin refreshing.</li>
            <li> I just star it using this product and I&#x27;m already in love with it</li>
            <li> I love the product!!!</li>
            <li> Great cream works perfect</li>
            <li> I used an antire bottle and saw no difference maybe it works on someone &#x27;s else</li>
            <li> OMG!  I got a compliment from my husband!  I usually don&#x27;t bother leaving reviews but when your husband keeps staring at you with a slightly malicious smile and asks you what you have been doing different because he likes your new glow then its time to give a product its due.  I told him that I was eating a little healthier (Ha!) The only thing different is that I started using this cream about three weeks ago and with these results I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, here is the breakdown for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it.  It comes in a pump so its easy to put a few dabs on your finger.  I have been using it nightly and have had no skin issues with it what so ever.  It spreads on smooth and feels good.  It does come with a faint fragrance but it is so faint that it is neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like trying out new products from Amazon because if I don&#x27;t like it I can always return it with no problems.  But I AM KEEPING this one!  Hopefully more compliments to come ;)</li>
            <li> Great so far item was deliver on time just hoping it works as good as they advertise it.</li>
            <li> Well I would said it made my face red and I got scare and stopped using it wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> I am so excited!! I ordered my bottle of Myamor organic serum and I can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive. I have heard great reviews from friends who are using it and love it.</li>
            <li> Because of my allergies during the summer I have not bee. Able to use it everyday but my problem area seems better, I regret not buying two bottles when the price was 25.99, ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I love this serum! This is my first week trying this product and so far I love it! I can definitely see a lot of clarity on my face and some of my pimples have already started to disappear. This serum feels like a lift to your face and a little goes a long way! I personally love the smell and I love that is very affordable. This is a keeper for me. I am sure the more you use it the better your face will look.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Serum! Thanks myamor</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be turning 40 this year.  My coworkers ask me what serum I use, so I got my phone out and showed my instagram photo of Myamor.  I told them to order it on Amazon.  I know it&#x27;s been days of me using it, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference it&#x27;s made on me.  I even went out shopping without makeup.  If you really know me you would know I never do.  But this serum gave me the confidence, I needed.  Thank you Myrka For sharing your secret!  I&#x27;ll be following you for years.  You are a smart and beautiful women!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and I can see the difference.  I use it twice a day, in the day under my makeup and at night before going to bed.  My skin looks and feels younger with only 2 months of use.  I highly reccomend this product.  Great job Myrka!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. The best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried from the most expensive and exclusive brands. Myamor is a keeper. Thank you Myrka Dellanos ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is that it&#x27;s super light when you apply it to your face.

But I&#x27;ve been using Myamor Serum for almost a week, and I can truly tell you that my face feels so fresh and clean. It&#x27;s an amazing feeling, and also we all need to use retinal constantly on our skin to stay young and hydrated. I know I&#x27;m only 23, but it&#x27;s time to take care of my skin. I definitely recommend this product to guys and girls. It&#x27;s a must have, for everyone.</li>
