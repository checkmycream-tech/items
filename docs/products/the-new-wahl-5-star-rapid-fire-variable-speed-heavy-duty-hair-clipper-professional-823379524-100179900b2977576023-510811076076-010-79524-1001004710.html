            <li>All in all its a great tool..</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper because it uses Oster 76 detachable blades instead of using clip on guides.</li>
            <li>in all this is a great clipper</li>
            <li>Way better than the Oster plastic spring loaded guards.&lt;br /&gt;6.The hour glass shape gives it an amazing feel best grip i have ever felt on any clipper of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it cuts nicely and doesn&#x27;t cut skin very nice</li>
            <li>He is soooooo pleased with the clippers and that makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>Love the adjustable speed motor!</li>
            <li>My goal was to reduce the time it takes to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>is nice too.</li>
            <li>to say its a nice detachable clipper</li>
            <li>Honestly, the variable speed option is nice</li>
            <li>quietest clipper of its kind, again NOT an adjustable blade clipper...</li>
            <li>Nice clipper</li>
            <li>Feel good nice and cool .only</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand very comfortably.</li>
            <li>this clipper is great for straight hair</li>
            <li>i do love it</li>
            <li>, I just couldnt think of a better way of putting it.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad the blades</li>
            <li>and im TOTALLY satisfied.</li>
            <li>but you should be using more than 1 clipper so it should never get warm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in my hands &amp; super light compared to the 76ers!</li>
            <li>A little noisy compared to Oster but works great!</li>
            <li>Fantastic performance.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Im a Master Barber and i have tried different detachable blade clippers and The Wahl Rappid Fire Clipper is by far one of the best clipper i have bought .</li>
            <li>, thats when we&#x27;ll have full control.</li>
            <li>then let it cool before I did her face and head.</li>
            <li>I used to be an owner of the Oster 76&#x27;s, awesome clippers in their own right, but I had an issue with how heavy they were and the overall feel of the clipper in my hands after awhile.</li>
            <li>Great for cutting through the thickest hair like a warm knife through butter!</li>
            <li>These Wahl clippers are probably just as powerful as the 76&#x27;s</li>
            <li>$ just was not cutting it (literally).  </li>
            <li>but when i saw how powerful they were</li>
            <li>and I must say he was right.  </li>
            <li>Takes a very long time to get warm...</li>
            <li>The plastic clip guards that come with those cheap clippers prevent from an even cut and they dont really restrict from even getting a real buzz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my first time writing review on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>smooth cuts even with old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clipper is an absolute beast!</li>
            <li>I am a professional Stylist I do 20 cuts a day everyday, this is by far the best rotary motor detachable blade clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>The other nice thing about it is that it has a dial so that you can choose the speed of the cut.  </li>
            <li>pretty much takes care all hair texture on any condition pretty well,</li>
            <li>very comfortable, light ,durable, the controle over these clippers while cutting is amazing .not</li>
            <li>Long cord so your not tugging for more cord.</li>
            <li>The Rapid Fire lays the hair down really nice</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Now I have 12 comb/spacers when all I really wanted was a 3/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is quiet and light weight.</li>
            <li>for its shape, very ergonomic which is a plus, no problem holding it whether scoop or pencil grip.</li>
            <li>I did her whole body in one shot (it used to take 5-6 breaks)</li>
            <li>I should have saved my money and bought only one clipper from wAHL and precisely this particular model.</li>
            <li>If there is a product thus far that I have tried that feels like it has more power, it would be the the oster 76er but the drsign and feel  in the hand of the rapid fire wins out hands down.</li>
            <li>,i&#x27;de rather flip a switch as my shop is pretty busy</li>
            <li>This is a definite big time investment that will surely pay for itself as soon as you put it to use.</li>
            <li>and you will love the adjustable speed and the overall shape, especially if you&#x27;re a busy barber like myself.</li>
            <li>Wahl normally makes quality products, and this is top-of-the-line...</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new pair of clippers to cut my hair seeing as I have been &#x27;buzzing&#x27; my head for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>but overall I can cut my hair about three times as fast and with better results since I&#x27;m not seeing missed spots or areas where my hair is slightly longer which can happen with my old clippers</li>
            <li>This clipper is strong enough to cut through any and all kind of hair, especially thick hair like butter.</li>
            <li>is also finger without much power, nor grip, nor control, i wish they redesign a version so that the dial would be around the thumb area, similar like a dremel</li>
            <li>I am a professional barber and use them all the time.  </li>
            <li>really loud at all.perfer these over 76ers.if</li>
            <li>Light but powerful, glides so easily through tough thick hair.</li>
            <li>My blades are very new, properly maintained and oiled often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use it everyday for work and clean it before i leave salon.</li>
            <li>He currently uses the Oster Classic 76 but said if he had to buy a set today, he would go with the Rapid Fire....</li>
            <li>Yet, it is smooth enough to glide over the top of your clients waves without cutting them out.</li>
            <li>why i got this over oster models is due to the fact its got much lesser maintainence to deal with down the road, but hopefully its got good long</li>
            <li>This is nice but almost unnecessary for me as I constantly keep it on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first variable speed clipper and compared to my other single speed wahl, this gives a much cleaner cut and is easier to control and maneuver.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very cheap and thin</li>
            <li>,i really do not like the on/off button...to much work to adjust it</li>
            <li>This is definitely a must-have for professional barbers.</li>
            <li>but I hardly ever turn it up to full speed, i just have not found it necessary.</li>
            <li>I have several cheaper clippers and all of them had trouble making a consistent even cut which used to cause me to have to go over and over the same area for 10+ minutes.</li>
            <li>Have not used on my husband yet, but shaved down my yorkies winter coat for the summer with it and only needed to break 1 time for it to cool down.</li>

            <li> but I hardly ever turn it up to full speed, i just have not found it necessary.</li>
            <li> I have several cheaper clippers and all of them had trouble making a consistent even cut which used to cause me to have to go over and over the same area for 10+ minutes.</li>
            <li> Have not used on my husband yet, but shaved down my yorkies winter coat for the summer with it and only needed to break 1 time for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> for its performance, it works 95% fine for most hair types, but difficult to cut if client has very thin hair or coarse (african american).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too loud and not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> so our palm &amp; fingers is much smaller/shorter compare to american, so its hard for me to reach</li>
            <li> The old school Wahl clippers that I bought at Kohl&#x27;s previously for 30</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it gets a little hot to the touch after its on for a while, but other than that, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was buying similar Philips products in the past which where several times cheaper and which could never make a cut without passing the machine over and over again the same place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stepup my game and look at the higher quality products.  </li>
            <li> Whether your hair is wet or dry, it just cuts your hair off evenly, all the way around.  </li>
            <li> The largest comb/spacer is only 1/2\\&quot; which is a little shorter than I like.</li>
            <li> These things are beasts and run circles around all my other clippers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no cons at all.</li>
            <li> thing is there a bit noisy but other</li>
            <li> Only caution is that with these clippers, unlike the Osters, it is possible to attach a new blade and turn it on without having the blade firmly seated into the cutting head.  </li>
            <li> the housing inside the chrome area cracked after half year of use, never dropped it.</li>
            <li> I managed to finish my work within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I still have to make a few passes with the Rapid fire</li>
            <li> I just got one a few days ago and tried it out...</li>
            <li> definitely not the worse clipper</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I had to also purchase separately the Wahl 3390-100 Stainless Steel Attachment Guide set which seems to be marketed for dogs</li>
            <li> With the blade not moving, it will cause a LOT of discomfort for your client until you figure out what is wrong and push them all the way down.  </li>
            <li> If want to step ur game up ,then u need these clippers .</li>
            <li> Step up your game with these!</li>
            <li> so i can use for work, they use andis bgr+ which i find difficult to cut on wet/long/thin hair, wahl rapid fire</li>
            <li> off switch is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> so i can swap it myself, replacement part is impossible to find on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> this clipper is great for straight hair it doesn&#x27;t allow the hair to slide away it cuts nicely and doesn&#x27;t cut skin very nice i do love it</li>
            <li> Man! This is the best clipper that I have ever used! Love the adjustable speed motor! Great for cutting through the thickest hair like a warm knife through butter! Very comfortable in my hands &amp; super light compared to the 76ers! Step up your game with these! The BEST!</li>
            <li> My fiance loves these clippers!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I was buying similar Philips products in the past which where several times cheaper and which could never make a cut without passing the machine over and over again the same place. I should have saved my money and bought only one clipper from wAHL and precisely this particular model. I managed to finish my work within a few seconds. Fantastic performance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used to be an owner of the Oster 76&#x27;s, awesome clippers in their own right, but I had an issue with how heavy they were and the overall feel of the clipper in my hands after awhile. These Wahl clippers are probably just as powerful as the 76&#x27;s and you will love the adjustable speed and the overall shape, especially if you&#x27;re a busy barber like myself. The Rapid Fire lays the hair down really nice and you can adjust the speed of the clipper as well!! Wahl normally makes quality products, and this is top-of-the-line...hence the name &amp;#34;Wahl 5-Star&amp;#34;. Invest in these clippers and they will make you a LOT of money in return, you will be very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> My goal was to reduce the time it takes to cut my own hair. I have several cheaper clippers and all of them had trouble making a consistent even cut which used to cause me to have to go over and over the same area for 10+ minutes. I still have to make a few passes with the Rapid fire but overall I can cut my hair about three times as fast and with better results since I&#x27;m not seeing missed spots or areas where my hair is slightly longer which can happen with my old clippers not because I missed the area but because it just did not cut it all the way. I like the metal comb/spacers and the way that they clip on is nice too. The largest comb/spacer is only 1/2\\&quot; which is a little shorter than I like. I was disappointed that I had to also purchase separately the Wahl 3390-100 Stainless Steel Attachment Guide set which seems to be marketed for dogs but is definitely the same as the combs that come with this model just to get a 3/4\\&quot; comb/spacer. Now I have 12 comb/spacers when all I really wanted was a 3/4\\&quot;. Still I give it 5 stars even though I think they should include a bigger comb.</li>
            <li> Too noise.&lt;br /&gt;On/off switch is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Light but powerful, glides so easily through tough thick hair. Long cord so your not tugging for more cord.</li>
            <li> Great tool.. wish the blades were easier to get off while switching from blade to blade. Comfortable to hold. All in all its a great tool..</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper because it uses Oster 76 detachable blades instead of using clip on guides. It fits in the hand very comfortably. A little noisy compared to Oster but works great!</li>
            <li> This is my first variable speed clipper and compared to my other single speed wahl, this gives a much cleaner cut and is easier to control and maneuver.</li>
            <li> my first time writing review on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have to say its a nice detachable clipper so i can use for work, they use andis bgr+ which i find difficult to cut on wet/long/thin hair, wahl rapid fire pretty much takes care all hair texture on any condition pretty well, smooth cuts even with old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reason why i got this over oster models is due to the fact its got much lesser maintainence to deal with down the road, but hopefully its got good long lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 4 stars for one reason, i find the variable dial to be in a crappy location. im asian so our palm &amp; fingers is much smaller/shorter compare to american, so its hard for me to reach (i then need to use ring finger instead).&lt;br /&gt;pinky is also finger without much power, nor grip, nor control, i wish they redesign a version so that the dial would be around the thumb area, similar like a dremel, thats when we&#x27;ll have full control.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new pair of clippers to cut my hair seeing as I have been &#x27;buzzing&#x27; my head for about 2 years now.  The old school Wahl clippers that I bought at Kohl&#x27;s previously for 30$ just was not cutting it (literally).  The plastic clip guards that come with those cheap clippers prevent from an even cut and they dont really restrict from even getting a real buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stepup my game and look at the higher quality products.  My buddy recommended this set of cliippers as he said these were the latest/greatest when it comes to head clippers.  He currently uses the Oster Classic 76 but said if he had to buy a set today, he would go with the Rapid Fire....and I must say he was right.  The Wahl Rapid Fire cuts through your hair like butter.  Now as cliche as that definitely sounds, I just couldnt think of a better way of putting it.  Whether your hair is wet or dry, it just cuts your hair off evenly, all the way around.  The other nice thing about it is that it has a dial so that you can choose the speed of the cut.  This is nice but almost unnecessary for me as I constantly keep it on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great clipper and I have to give it a 5/5.  The only negative is that it gets a little hot to the touch after its on for a while, but other than that, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> OMG!!  These things are beasts and run circles around all my other clippers.  I am a professional barber and use them all the time.  Only caution is that with these clippers, unlike the Osters, it is possible to attach a new blade and turn it on without having the blade firmly seated into the cutting head.  With the blade not moving, it will cause a LOT of discomfort for your client until you figure out what is wrong and push them all the way down.  Other than that, no cons at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last... not a daily workhorse.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to my husband for his profession.  He is soooooo pleased with the clippers and that makes me happy.  Would definitely purchase from your company again and recommend others as well!! Thanks</li>
            <li> it just doesnt seem to have the speed n power of my oster .although i&#x27;m glad the blades r interchangable,i really do not like the on/off button...to much work to adjust it,i&#x27;de rather flip a switch as my shop is pretty busy</li>
            <li> Im a Master Barber and i have tried different detachable blade clippers and The Wahl Rappid Fire Clipper is by far one of the best clipper i have bought . It took me a day or two to get use to changeing the blades but i got the hang of it and im TOTALLY satisfied.</li>
            <li> I researched everywhere for the best detachable clipper out there and stumbled upon this Wahl Rapid Fire. I just got one a few days ago and tried it out... It is a BEAST. Cuts through hair soooo smoothe with ease. It is quiet and light weight. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in Barber School. I&#x27;ve got some pics of it on my Instagram @Neek_suave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t delt with wahl in a while but when i saw how powerful they were i couldnt resist. very comfortable, light ,durable, the controle over these clippers while cutting is amazing .not really loud at all.perfer these over 76ers.if you can ....cop em you won&#x27;t  regret it.sighing  off Deazy master barber 12 yrs and counting</li>
            <li> the housing inside the chrome area cracked after half year of use, never dropped it. i use it everyday for work and clean it before i leave salon. The plastic is very cheap and thin i dont know if it happened to anyone. Motor still runs but just matter of time when  the crack reach the the area where it screws the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Im waiting for wahl to reply see if they can sent me housing so i can swap it myself, replacement part is impossible to find on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its performance, it works 95% fine for most hair types, but difficult to cut if client has very thin hair or coarse (african american). My blades are very new, properly maintained and oiled often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its shape, very ergonomic which is a plus, no problem holding it whether scoop or pencil grip.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too loud and not powerful enough. definitely not the worse clipper but i don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This clipper is an absolute beast! This is definitely a must-have for professional barbers. This is a variable speed detachable blade clipper that brings plenty of muscle.The clipper comes with 4 steel guards and it is equipped with a #1 blade. This clipper is strong enough to cut through any and all kind of hair, especially thick hair like butter. Yet, it is smooth enough to glide over the top of your clients waves without cutting them out. DEFINITE PLUS! Honestly, the variable speed option is nice but I hardly ever turn it up to full speed, i just have not found it necessary. If there is a product thus far that I have tried that feels like it has more power, it would be the the oster 76er but the drsign and feel  in the hand of the rapid fire wins out hands down. Maintenance is also a breeze. I start all of my clients haircuts with these clippers and it helps with speed and lessens the fatigue on your adjustable clippers. This is a definite big time investment that will surely pay for itself as soon as you put it to use. I hope this helps, buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I am a professional Stylist I do 20 cuts a day everyday, this is by far the best rotary motor detachable blade clipper I have ever used. First things first this is NOT an adjustable clipper if you do not know the difference go here [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Does not use carbon brushes&lt;br /&gt;2. variable speed&lt;br /&gt;3. Takes a very long time to get warm...but you should be using more than 1 clipper so it should never get warm.&lt;br /&gt;4.The quietest clipper of its kind, again NOT an adjustable blade clipper...reference ^^^&lt;br /&gt;5.The metal guards are great! Way better than the Oster plastic spring loaded guards.&lt;br /&gt;6.The hour glass shape gives it an amazing feel best grip i have ever felt on any clipper of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could keep going but that should do it, If you are just starting out or may be pro for years and are hesitating on spending the money I assure this is a must have in your toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres a wahl video on it&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Have not used on my husband yet, but shaved down my yorkies winter coat for the summer with it and only needed to break 1 time for it to cool down. I did her whole body in one shot (it used to take 5-6 breaks) then let it cool before I did her face and head. Great clippers!</li>
            <li> Nice clipper If want to step ur game up ,then u need these clippers . Feel good nice and cool .only thing is there a bit noisy but other than that u won&#x27;t be disappointed.wahl is defiantly my  brand of choice.</li>
