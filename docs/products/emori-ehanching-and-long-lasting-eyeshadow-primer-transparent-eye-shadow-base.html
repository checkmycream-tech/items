            <li>For the price work really good</li>
            <li>I love this, and it&#x27;s good for any skin color!</li>
            <li>The price, however, is exceedingly exceptional.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>But I love them so thumbs up!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>- I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>And its clear so if you put it in a not so perfect shape, no one will be able to tell, unlike a flesh toned primer.</li>
            <li>it makes your eye shadow very smooth and it keep it from creasing up</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Would for sure buy it again.</li>
            <li>so i looked on amazon and saw this was nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The texture is more like Vaseline.</li>
            <li>makes colors pop well when put on first then a bright color on top</li>
            <li>but it lasts pretty good.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is a good product because of the consistency and smell first.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed in any way at all!</li>
            <li>Very cool stuff.</li>
            <li>It creases easily and does not work that well.</li>
            <li>I love this product, So far it is by far the best I have found!</li>
            <li>Fine texture.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>I got this and saw a cheap price tag thinking to myself, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;I guess I&#x27;ll try it what do I have to lose?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a great primer especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Secondly I will say that it made my eye shadow go on great and indeed seem to enhanced the color.</li>
            <li>At first I wanted to make sure that this is transparent</li>
            <li>I have used a ton of different eye shadow primers and this one is by far the best one yet!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an actual good buy.</li>
            <li>I used to go without using any type of eye primer and having the problem with my bright colors fading quickly and overall</li>
            <li>Quick arrival.</li>
            <li>Not to forget the price and how quickly it got here</li>
            <li>For the price and all, it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no Urban Decay primer potion, which lasts on me ALL day AKA 12hrs or more without creasing..</li>
            <li>If you are willing to cope with the primer&#x27;s performance, give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I do Visual Kei or a more over-exaggerated form of Glamour rock.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well!</li>
            <li>Brings out the color in the eyeshadow really well!</li>
            <li>Works better as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This came today on the 16th when it was supposed to come on the 18th two days early!!!!</li>
            <li>For the price it was amazing that it kept my makeup in place which rarely happened with the primers that were way more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li>Really  enhances my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I dont think the primer works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to make much of a difference to me.</li>
            <li>This really helped keep the eye shadow from coming off.</li>
            <li>but I really do think this deserves it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Im very into makeups and primers</li>
            <li>I dont wear makeup that much</li>
            <li>I has really helped to keep my eyeshadow from looking all wrinkled.</li>
            <li>THANKS THREW AWAY</li>
            <li>It worked very well and kept my eye shadow on for hours upon hours</li>
            <li>Considering the price this product is fairly decent.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, long lasting and makes it so my make up won&#x27;t crease.  </li>
            <li>I found it kind of hard to work with.</li>
            <li>Gave a few a gifts hope it works better for them.</li>
            <li>And shadow that seems to never dull unless I rub it of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; Well, it works pretty darn well with the MAC pigments and even your basic eye-shadows.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed it in, it completely disappeared!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend!</li>
            <li>But it is clear like it say it is</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Very GREASY I have enough Oil going ON!!  </li>
            <li>So far I like the product i will order again when needed.</li>
            <li>This is a good alternative to an expensive primer like you&#x27;d find at sephora.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t capture my highly pigmented eyeshadow, and it ended up creasing an hour or so later....</li>
            <li>This is a semi-clear gel that only takes a little bit to cover your eyelid and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>, this isn&#x27;t transparent!&amp;#34; Luckily, I proceeded to take the small amount and put it on my hand.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , this isn&#x27;t transparent!&amp;#34; Luckily, I proceeded to take the small amount and put it on my hand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and doesn&#x27;t last long on the eyes.</li>
            <li> This will last you quite a long time!</li>
            <li> Other drug store primers last way longer.</li>
            <li> Now I can have eyeliner that lasts for a very long period of time.</li>
            <li> It also gave my eye shadow a bit of color pop and made it a bit brighter than if I ran it dry on my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The tube looks really small in the picture, but it is actually quite big!!</li>
            <li> I am an experienced primer user, and this is one of the worst I have used.</li>
            <li> Although I do not have dark skin, this would definitely make dark skin look ashy.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my mascara and eye line forming an extra layer of darkness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do extreme makeup looks with vibrants colors or beauty photoshoots.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, it does not give my make up a shimmery look and it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup last very long.</li>
            <li> I assumed that because I am dark, colors would just automatically become bland against my skin.</li>
            <li> I had no clue what I was missing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> just plain out rubbing</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would like this product when I saw it online</li>
            <li> I mean I could buy two small frenchfries at McDonald&#x27;s for this money..</li>
            <li> So it would have even phased me if I didn&#x27;t like them to spend such a small amount, and I&#x27;d be shocked if anyone even left a bad rating on this product because it&#x27;s literally pocket change to buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look so tired at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> I sadly have the oiliest eyelids and this creases on me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a base to go on under your eye shadow</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup crease terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> it makes your eyeshadow stay o but it makes your eyes look greasy.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, long lasting and makes it so my make up won&#x27;t crease.  Very cool stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really  enhances my eye shadow. Would  buy again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT AND FAST DELIVERY I AM LIKING IT</li>
            <li> I dont think the primer works very well. I am dissapointed in it and will probably end up tossing it out.  Gave a few a gifts hope it works better for them.</li>
            <li> This came today on the 16th when it was supposed to come on the 18th two days early!!!! And also works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I sadly have the oiliest eyelids and this creases on me. It&#x27;s no Urban Decay primer potion, which lasts on me ALL day AKA 12hrs or more without creasing.. but it lasts pretty good. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it, especially if I don&#x27;t need extended amount of hours of play or work. It&#x27;s an actual good buy. It does enhance shadows as opposed to no primer at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I do have one they gave me with a different purchase. I think it&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to make much of a difference to me.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully, keeps my eye shadow bright all day</li>
            <li> This really helped keep the eye shadow from coming off.</li>
            <li> The product, proving contradictory to its initial statement, is not transparent. Although I do not have dark skin, this would definitely make dark skin look ashy. I am an experienced primer user, and this is one of the worst I have used. It creases easily and does not work that well. The price, however, is exceedingly exceptional. If you are willing to cope with the primer&#x27;s performance, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I used to go without using any type of eye primer and having the problem with my bright colors fading quickly and overall just plain out rubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an musician and I do Visual Kei or a more over-exaggerated form of Glamour rock. I got this and saw a cheap price tag thinking to myself, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;I guess I&#x27;ll try it what do I have to lose?&amp;#34; Well, it works pretty darn well with the MAC pigments and even your basic eye-shadows. Now I can have eyeliner that lasts for a very long period of time. And shadow that seems to never dull unless I rub it of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I don&#x27;t give anything a 5 but I really do think this deserves it thanks Emori I may look to see if you have further cosmetics and if so give that a try as well. Wonderful product here.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with This product.It came on time.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, it does not give my make up a shimmery look and it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup last very long.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well! Would for sure buy it again. Im very into makeups and primers and i think this is the best eyeshadow primer ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Sticking power doesn&#x27;t exist. It didn&#x27;t capture my highly pigmented eyeshadow, and it ended up creasing an hour or so later....Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It wus good to get this I wks happy win I did it help my eyeshadow looking good...</li>
            <li> I dont wear makeup that much but I do wear eyeshadow every onve in a while but it never last the entire day so i looked on amazon and saw this was nice and cheap. After buying this product I didnt see a difference in my eyeshadow it still came off with in an hour. But it is clear like it say it is</li>
            <li> Fine texture. Good product.</li>
            <li> makes colors pop well when put on first then a bright color on top</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would like this product when I saw it online but I tried it out anyway. I had never used an eyeshadow primer in my life and thought why the heck not. I am not disappointed in any way at all! It&#x27;s easy to use and works perfectly. For the price and all, it is totally worth it. Love it!</li>
            <li> The tube looks really small in the picture, but it is actually quite big!! It also lasts a longgg time and i would say it is the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used! I recommend getting it!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as shown in picture and is transparent. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. It doesn&#x27;t last long. Other drug store primers last way longer.</li>
            <li> I has really helped to keep my eyeshadow from looking all wrinkled. This product does the job</li>
            <li> This is a great primer especially for the price. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or beauty guru so I don&#x27;t do extreme makeup looks with vibrants colors or beauty photoshoots. So with that being said I don&#x27;t know if this would be up to par for that level of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I do know I have used Too Faced eye shadow primer, and to me this works as well! And you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price. I bought two without knowing if I&#x27;d like them and I&#x27;m glad I did. I mean I could buy two small frenchfries at McDonald&#x27;s for this money.. So it would have even phased me if I didn&#x27;t like them to spend such a small amount, and I&#x27;d be shocked if anyone even left a bad rating on this product because it&#x27;s literally pocket change to buy. But I love them so thumbs up!</li>
            <li> good&lt;br /&gt;does the work</li>
            <li> Helped to keep my make up from creasing all day! Brings out the color in the eyeshadow really well!</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of different eye shadow primers and this one is by far the best one yet!!! My eyeshadow stays on a lot longer with this compared to the others</li>
            <li> I compared this to my ELF eyeshadow primer, it made a world of difference! I had no clue what I was missing. I assumed that because I am dark, colors would just automatically become bland against my skin. I am pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth the price. I will probably go ahead and buy another one just to ensure that I am set when the one I have runs out.</li>
            <li> Very GREASY I have enough Oil going ON!!  NO THANKS THREW AWAY</li>
            <li> Quick arrival. For the price it was amazing that it kept my makeup in place which rarely happened with the primers that were way more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and doesn&#x27;t last long on the eyes. It makes my makeup crease terribly. Works better as a facial moisturizer. Trust me. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and i know what a good eye shadow primer is supposed to feel and look like. This is not it! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, So far it is by far the best I have found!</li>
            <li> I will say that this is a good product because of the consistency and smell first. Secondly I will say that it made my eye shadow go on great and indeed seem to enhanced the color. But, my eye shadow&#x27;s color  seemed to disappear at the end of the day. Maybe if I&#x27;d used a setting mist as well  it would have been the total package that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this! At first I wanted to make sure that this is transparent so I squeezed the smallest amount out and I was like, &amp;#34;Darn, this isn&#x27;t transparent!&amp;#34; Luckily, I proceeded to take the small amount and put it on my hand. When I rubbed it in, it completely disappeared! I love this, and it&#x27;s good for any skin color! (I&#x27;m a chocolate tone and it worked perfectly on me). Not to forget the price and how quickly it got here (I&#x27;m in Massachusetts). I completely recommend!</li>
            <li> Works just great! This is a good alternative to an expensive primer like you&#x27;d find at sephora. And its clear so if you put it in a not so perfect shape, no one will be able to tell, unlike a flesh toned primer.</li>
            <li> works great i like it</li>
            <li> It is great thanks.ðŸ˜Šit makes your eye shadow very smooth and it keep it from creasing up and that&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> The texture is more like Vaseline. I found it kind of hard to work with. It was too oily for me.</li>
            <li> the product came to me in the estimated time, excellent</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my mascara and eye line forming an extra layer of darkness under my eyes.  This product keeps my eye makeup where it belongs. I don&#x27;t look so tired at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> This is a base to go on under your eye shadow To prep them for the color that will go on. This is a semi-clear gel that only takes a little bit to cover your eyelid and absorbs quickly. This will last you quite a long time! It worked very well and kept my eye shadow on for hours upon hours (i used it to go to a con and my shadow was still perfect afterwards) It also gave my eye shadow a bit of color pop and made it a bit brighter than if I ran it dry on my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It realy is a great product</li>
            <li> For the price work really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to makeup so I&#x27;m learning. So far I like the product i will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps the eye shadow stay in place longer!</li>
            <li> Considering the price this product is fairly decent.</li>
