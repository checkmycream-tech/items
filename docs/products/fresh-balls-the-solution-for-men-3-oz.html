            <li>Works great.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>My husband found this neither efficacious nor pleasant.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not work good if you have a george bush downstairs.</li>
            <li>If the price hits $3.00/bottle, then its a good deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>and they even commented on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>def good product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t taste good for the ladies.</li>
            <li>and why not smell good for my GF.</li>
            <li>A good price for a good product.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved this idea and I wanted it to be the godsend</li>
            <li>good product&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;good , but not that good</li>
            <li>I read the good review in Mens health magazine.</li>
            <li>With these two working together, I am good to go anytime any place.</li>
            <li>You think these folks would&#x27;ve loved to been on Oprah or Dr. Phil to advertise this product?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stings a bit when going on, doesn&#x27;t work as well as a good powder (e.g. Balla)&lt;br /&gt;DEAL BREAKER:</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used relating to, well, having fresh balls.</li>
            <li>This is a very interesting product.  </li>
            <li>No product is going to be perfect for everyone, but I found that Fresh Balls did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very very very pleased</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product was a featured item and SO HILARIOUS!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Interested to see how it performs in the legendary Arizona heat this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product and I&#x27;m about to order more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is better than powder!  </li>
            <li>If the powder gets on clothes, it rinses of wipes off fairly easily, and this can occur when using your fly.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>An amazing purchase.</li>
            <li>fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy..</li>
            <li>I had to supplement with powder which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>I got to thinking, what kind of powder is used to absorb sweat and tackle bacteria:</li>
            <li>If you warm up though, you will still get swamp crotch.</li>
            <li>but im honest.</li>
            <li>The name of the product is kind of embarrassing (not the sort of thing I would ever want someone to see me buying/using), but it did get my attention.</li>
            <li>I have always been a Gold Bond or Baby Powder on my balls kind of guy.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it helps prolong the amount if time you have to race to the shower after a good workout. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Gave them as presents for Xmas to my gym rat kids they loved the fresh balls great for workouts prevents your jock rash</li>
            <li>and this was a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>tingles when you put it on but does a nice job at removing smells.</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave powder all over clothes or the floor.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled to say my decades-long agony is over.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>This product works mostly good and has a very nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in that it goes on easy (much better than applying a powder)and</li>
            <li>Fresh makes a HUGE improvement ... smells great !</li>
            <li>only that these are really good people but their product works perfect just as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re super happy with this.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to rinse off, and I didn&#x27;t smell anything after using all day.</li>
            <li>or more energetic!</li>
            <li>Great for hot summer days!  </li>
            <li>What can I say, my balls smell fresh, lol.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something easier to apply than a powder, but in my opinion the Gold Bond is much more effective.  </li>
            <li>Fresh Balls works great.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use as directed and you too, will have great success and freshness.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this and thought it&#x27;d be a great gag gift for my husband, but found very promising reviews.  </li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li>I at first thought it was a great product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, dries quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>Many years of jockitch because of the.moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this freaking product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, spend the $12.00 on a couple more drinks for the lady, and she won&#x27;t mind the swamp crotch anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>And the product smells okay.</li>
            <li>My balls have never felt better, If you have any balls at all you should try this product.</li>
            <li>sure they&#x27;d appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Was ok.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product, but I have to say I can tell a difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Im going to by more.</li>
            <li>I work in construction and sweat most days all day.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it more than he did.</li>
            <li>Its ok I guess.  </li>
            <li>If he does, I will be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \\&quot;powder puff\\&quot; to apply the powder under scrotum, etc.</li>
            <li>Prob better with boxers than briefs.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands after application though...</li>
            <li>Dont you think im so sexy?</li>
            <li>I like the idea of this product and it worked ok when I tried it out.</li>
            <li>My ladies love it.</li>
            <li>You are better to do without.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I cannot say really if it better than the talc at absorption, but the product does work as described.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands after applying or you&#x27;ll get ghost hands.</li>
            <li>product, glad it exists, customer for life.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better to keep and use after the gym to tide me over until I can get home but not for all day dryness.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands as soon as you apply the solution.  </li>
            <li>I love the weather here, but a tropical climate can wreak havic on your manhood.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I hit the clubs with a bit more confidence.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am sure they have sold a lot of product as a joke gift because of the name.</li>
            <li>You sale was everything I hoped for &amp; more.</li>
            <li>I think they should have gave it a more respectable name seeing as though guys like me have a wife and 2 daughters.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be the next greatest thing in hygeine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more do you have to say.</li>
            <li>In my experience that&#x27;s where most of the odor comes from to begin with.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was not 100% sure if the product was causing the burning..</li>
            <li>Very nice and gentle aroma too.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product today for the first time and THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li>IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>worth the money!!  </li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and ended up using it more than him, rather than buying my own tube of the Fresh Boobs or whatever it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li>Awesome product...definitely helps you stay dry.</li>
            <li>I found the best way to use the product is to apply, let it dry then get dressed.</li>
            <li>...if you use &amp;#34;Balls&amp;#34;, you know it is effective, but may get a little stingy - this stuff works great to make things nice again.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh feeling all day</li>
            <li>Real fresh.</li>
            <li>Mens Health rating it as the best product for keeping your crotch dry and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does a good job keeping them dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all better buy stock in Fresh Balls, because my husband swears by this product!</li>
            <li>The product smells pleasant enough and I will say it is better than nothing, but it sure didn&#x27;t work miracles.</li>
            <li>It stays out of your way once it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy apply,lasts,my woman appreciates the non man smell,</li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone, like me, who has to be outside walking around for many hours at a time.</li>
            <li>Functions well and easy to use</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No powdered sugar coating, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Although it did not have a strong scent I feel it should have.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is really strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts all day, prevents chafing, keeps him dry, and has a very pleasant light scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply this stuff to your scrotal section, and rejoice in the cool dryness bestowed on your balls by this ingenious product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finely I found a product that works</li>
            <li>The lotion has a pleasant smell (not girly) and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m fresh and lovely...</li>
            <li>Love my fresh balls.</li>
            <li>smell and sweat free all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on like an ointment and dries to a light talc, but leaves no powder residue</li>
            <li>It gives a comfortable feeling for a minute,  then nothing.  </li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s great, gotta wash your hands tho because it leaves white marks on anything you touch.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the extra amount over the 3oz tube but the 30z tube is great for travellers who don;t check bags</li>
            <li>Recently one of my buddies was talking about this stuff saying how great it is and</li>
            <li>but then starts to become smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>my morning shower I coat my sack with this fantastic product.</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth a try -- just make sure you read the instructions</li>
            <li>This does not seem scientifically sound...</li>
            <li>Next month I&#x27;m meeting a woman who I met on a dating site and we already plan to have some great stories to remember.  </li>
            <li>and then it dries to a powder, like a light &#x27;dusting&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>save on shipping, (make it free)</li>
            <li>For the moment yes it works but for guys that  sweat more then others this will only be good to try it for your self.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today after a shower and this is the best I felt for a long time.</li>
            <li>Works great, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Although it is nice to not use messy powders for ones body, FB does not work nearly as good as most powders.</li>
            <li>A very clean fresh feeling still existed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, no more batwing, feels great.  </li>
            <li>Its super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It applies like a cream or lotion but quickly dries into a powder, so that makes it easy to put on.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll more than likely be very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and washes away easily.</li>
            <li>If you want the original product this is not what you will be getting.</li>
            <li>Balls are fresh all day!</li>
            <li>I want the original in the silver tube.</li>
            <li>Tends to work pretty well but make sure you are diligent about applying it</li>
            <li>Fresh Balls does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Go get some Fresh Balls today!</li>
            <li>I originally heard about it on the radio as part of a joke.</li>
            <li>Underground miner and his balls stay so fresh for 12 hours!</li>
            <li>FB is a good solution for VERY mild sweat, for instance, if you have a sedentary job in a cool building with temperate-to-cold weather outside.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use more than just a very thin layer, and it works awesome.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries quickly and works all day.</li>
            <li>stars, it keeps me happy, keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>Really helps with chaffing and keeps that area nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of keeping things dry.</li>
            <li>so certainly my wife would be able to.</li>
            <li>This stuff works SO incredibly well, and each bottle lasts a little longer than a</li>
            <li>putting this on is easy, put on, let dry and good to go.</li>
            <li>I understand the laugh and all, and it is funny as hell, but I think a lot more consideration and an awareness should&#x27;ve been taken considering.  </li>
            <li>product relieved much of the ball chafing and almost all of the ball stank in a way that Gold Bond has just never been able to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I contaced them and explained the situation.&lt;br /&gt;They expressed their sincer appologies and mailed me a free \\&quot;fresh</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep tube stored upright on cap otherwise when you squeeze it out will get too much at one time.</li>
            <li>It did leave that area smelling nice and feeling soft though.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for Howie Mandel, it&#x27;s good enough for me..  </li>
            <li>For now, back to good ol&#x27; cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Not as good as powder for me but its a personal preference.</li>
            <li>Instead of me just storing it in the place where all of my manly products are stored, in full view of my family, I have to hide it so that my daughters will not see it.  </li>
            <li>so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
            <li>so fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li>It works great for me, keeping me feeling dry and fresh all day no matter the work conditions.</li>
            <li>and I will most surely keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Nothing keeps the boys as fresh as Fresh Balls!</li>

            <li>, im just so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>He seriously talks about how awesome it is all the time.</li>
            <li>Goes on like a moisturizer but dries quickly into a powder.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail quickly and it works just the way it says it does.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>but quickly realized the musky smell the testes give off when working or working out(heck</li>
            <li>This product is only good if you are fresh out the shower and about to get freaky and you wanna be fresh for the moment.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my fiancé who is a mechanic and it&#x27;s been very hot and powder clumps and gets all over.</li>
            <li>the old design.&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty good, but the packaging graphics are pretty tacky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a liquid powder that is easy to apply and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I have used baby powder to stay dry, and to stop chaffing which works really good.</li>
            <li>Not that I needed any, but have received many a compliment and it has lasted a year so far!</li>
            <li>So fresh and so dry is good stuff keeps you fresh all day</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic alternative that lasts much longer than powders and doesn&#x27;t leave you with glue if you do get too</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t exactly fresh either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving Fresh Balls three stars because it works somewhat.</li>
            <li>I read an article that intrigued me to get some Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the try??</li>
            <li>I dont mind dealing with my husbands balls after he uses fresh balls.</li>

            <li>Thank you Fresh Balls for the dryness and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Discussing my problem, my friend recommended fresh balls.</li>

            <li>It is I my fellow man friends, Fresh Balls to the</li>

            <li>immediately ordered Fresh Balls from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>to their claim it keeps things fresh.</li>
            <li>Once the lotion drys, things stay fresh.</li>
            <li>seems to work...smells fresh...</li>
            <li>Now, I start my day with a fresh shower, and a fresh scrotum</li>

            <li>, this product is made of the identical ingredients of My Fresh Breasts.</li>

            <li>My friend let me try a dab of his Fresh Balls one night before hitting the night clubs.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Fresh</li>
            <li>As far as the performance goes, I can&#x27;t say if it reduces odor or not, but it does not perform any better than baby power for moisture control.</li>
            <li>So I guess it&#x27;s a useful gag gift?</li>
            <li>So fresh, you&#x27;ll want one at home and in the gym bag.</li>

            <li>but my friend said that he would &amp;#34;allow&amp;#34; me to use his fresh balls.  </li>

            <li>breast\\&quot; right</li>
            <li>, neither is it always the right place and time to start digging to separate the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I applied it after drying myself right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Right before exercise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have Goldbond powder all over the toilet seat and floor when I go to use the bathroom after my husband has just showered.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I really like and easy application.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, fresh, and dry going on...</li>
            <li>This product works great, keeps them dry for the day and much better than baby powder and other alternatives.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable product works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that functions as well as (if not better than)</li>
            <li>grey colored package was effective; the orange is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>really nice not having to adjust them all day long.!</li>
            <li>And throughout the day I honestly notice my balls are dry.</li>
            <li>Here at freshballs we take pride in using natural products that not only solve the problem, but they are good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves me slightly dryer than nothing but not as good as powder.</li>
            <li>It does work, and keeps my guys nice and dry.</li>
            <li>It does smell better then those, but I don&#x27;t believe that is worth paying that much extra for.</li>
            <li>I dont use it every day but mainly for special occasions or times</li>
            <li>Keeps my sac nice and dry during these hot, humid Nashville days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it &amp;#34;balls up&amp;#34; less than talcum powder and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot and humid in most of the places he goes and when in full uniform for long hours, you can imagine the discomfort.</li>
            <li>No sticky, no odor, nothing but dry freshness and an awesome feeling down there.</li>
            <li>Depending on what you do during your day you may need to freshen up, but Fresh Balls certainly makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>foot powder, Odor Eater&#x27;s Foot Powder to be exact.</li>
            <li>(imagine the hot sun shining on your lap all day)</li>
            <li>We first learned of this product when Howie Mandell talked about it on a talk show.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes the product and says that it works to prevent the chaffing that occurs in our hot, humid summers.  </li>
            <li>He will definitely be ordering more of this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>am not the first to state this.</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks it&#x27;s a joke at first but becomes a believer after the first application.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I save it for a hot date night.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>having people look at you funny when you start putting some on in the locker room...</li>
            <li>Seems to do the trick as I don&#x27;t see him adjusting himself unceremoniously in public any more.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I put some underneath my scrotum, at the top and between my legs, where they touch together.</li>
            <li>No weird smells coming from his undercarriage either.  </li>
            <li>Here is my honest review: This product works very well to keep the boys dry and clean smelling under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>Not 100% but pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>Working retail I&#x27;m walking around a lot and sometimes the building just gets hot</li>
            <li>it keeps him from &amp;#34;smelling&amp;#34; after a hot day ;)</li>
            <li>It gets hot and sweaty around these (and those) parts.</li>
            <li>Feels liquidity going on and for the first 15 minutes after application  </li>
            <li>I used to use gold bond but that cakes up and smells funny</li>
            <li>I think this stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>(I bought my first tube 10 days ago).</li>
            <li>When you first try it, your thoughts are \\&quot;Hmm...</li>
            <li>the more traditional alternatives.  </li>
            <li>thanks to the Fresh Balls solution.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>This product needs to be out in public more.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more as soon as this one gets low</li>
            <li>(which looks like it&#x27;ll last a while, it doesn&#x27;t take much more than a</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Okay, so my intent is not to be gross but simply to illustrate how much I love this</li>
            <li>Tried the product the first day I received it.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll update this review if anything unusual is mentioned about the Fresh Balls...</li>
            <li>Hawaiian Crisp Balls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this as something funny for my husbands stocking.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hot as hell here...</li>
            <li>Bought this because I work in a prison and it gets hot during the summer and with lots of walking around well, you get the idea.</li>
            <li>but with this I am good to go all day unless I go to the gym or walk a few miles in the summer</li>
            <li>works great, lasts a long time during those hot n sweaty moments, keeps you feeling just like it says, fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>You have to use quite a bit of it for it to be moderately effective, and reapplication on the fly is pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li>word of caution: dry off before applying LOL, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get what feels like white lint on your scrotum.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and most of the time I free ball because it is keeps things dry.</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth, dries to mess free powdered finish!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, goes on wet but ends up like a powder!?</li>
            <li>Nice drying and slight menthol refreshing feeling upon application and shortly after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Review title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>Goes on like a lotion and dries pretty fast to a powder.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t live in too hot of an area!</li>
            <li>It keeps him dry and comfortable during the very hot summer days.</li>
            <li>Does an okay job of keeping you dry.</li>
            <li>got this on a friends recommendation and I am very pleased with the way it works, totally kills the swamp problem I get while working outside at my job.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re dry, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting on a soothing invisible layer of magical angel whispers.</li>
            <li>Following the first administration, within minutes my crotch was feeling so comfortable again.</li>
            <li>Keeps em&#x27; feeling like i just got outta the shower for pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li>a large amount spurted out of the opening.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Even by the end of the next work day the boys are dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>The old formula worked, the new formula leaves you wet and sticky and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>At this point In my recovery I&#x27;m pretty sure my wife would have divorced me (or at least would be sleeping in the guest room) without fresh balls, so thank you!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to our boys in uniform everywhere!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I was devastated, withdrwan and I really didn&#x27;t talk to the people around me</li>
            <li>The light fragrance is back</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does stop the odor and the sweat!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and if I am taking time to get ready I will use this.</li>
            <li>ALso I had a whole tube taken from me at Heathrow because it is 5oz.</li>
            <li>Hey, much to my surprise</li>
            <li>He commented that he really likes it, that it, &amp;#34;keeps him from sticking.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After discovering that it wasn&#x27;t available locally, I ordered it from an Amazon Merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it sounds like a gag gift, but it really works.</li>
            <li>maybe because no one else wants it as they knew how it would work???</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My husband is a guitar player and always complains about how much he sweats while jumping around on stage.  </li>
            <li>It makes him much more&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to that evening.</li>
            <li>Thanks I luv my purchase</li>
            <li>I havent tried it in the summer yet, that will be the real test.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It costs way too much for the amount given.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Dont be cheap and buy Johnsons &amp; Johnsons powder...will not do the same...</li>
            <li>if it at least smell good</li>
            <li>It may work for mild wetting but when you have to work long hours involving many physical labor</li>
            <li>the new container is a garish orange (think Tide box) and medium blue which seems even less attractive graphically then</li>
            <li>Better than baby powder, gold bond and any other item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it, it gives a nice chilling sense, and clean aroma.</li>
            <li>No longer will they worry that they may not be &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough when looking for Ms. Right!</li>
            <li>I am a different person at work and I am definately more social with the girls</li>
            <li>I am sweat free ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>Just makes you feel so fresh and clean down there and guess what NO WETNESS.</li>
            <li>If this was a $3 item, I would probably keep using it as I search for something better, but at $12-15 a tube (which lasts about two months if you don&#x27;t use it too liberally), I think I&#x27;ll just try a liquid cornstarch type lotion for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>The product sort of feels like a smooth lotion that you put on your hands when they get too dry.  </li>
            <li>After the day is over with you are left with mild sweaty balls and flakes in your underware.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, smells decent, you don&#x27;t notice its there except you don&#x27;t chaf like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to apply than powder, and does seem to keep things cool and dry.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried this product with high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>In spite of the high price I tried it</li>
            <li>The product is of high quality and applies like lotion.</li>
            <li>Finally a cure for a hot chef!  </li>
            <li>but you have to put a little more then a quarter of the product before you get your unit fully covered.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is just unique to me, but in my experience the dry effect would wear off within 3-4 hours if that</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and fresh all day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy and does not take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Underwear and blue jeans did not rub and the crease between my legs and body was calm.</li>
            <li>I tried Fresh Balls for a solid week</li>
            <li>I am now placing my THIRD order for Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li>I totally remembered the name of course, since it does have quite a fun</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I saw Howie Mandel pitching the virtues of Fresh Balls on Jay Leno&#x27;s show one night, and was intrigued.</li>
            <li>follow the directions just as described and honestly you don&#x27;t need to re-apply for at least 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li>I have used Fresh Balls for a while now and they only con about it</li>
            <li>Fast forward to the first several uses: his balls feel like they are kept in a laboratory desiccator!  </li>
            <li>I would usually wait until after a shower to be intimate and those aren&#x27;t always the most convenient times.</li>
            <li>only then did I realize the awesomeness of Fresh balls.  </li>
            <li>So my gal got this for me as a gag gift after we saw a documentary where fresh balls was apart of it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest searching for other liquid talc products if you want something that does its job just fine in this area.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend Fresh Balls to any guy looking to keep cool and dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and it keeps things dry and fresh longer than any powder or lotion.</li>
            <li>Fresh Balls, I dry the area very well, to start, often even using a hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on you or your clothes, just make sure to apply it while you are DRY.</li>
            <li>As promised this product helps keep your crotch dry and sweet.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and do a lot of driving for my job</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li>I live in Orlando Florida</li>
            <li>I think that FB lessens the swamp crotch, and helps it dry quickly.</li>
            <li>And for personal hygiene, is their really a thing as spending too much?  </li>
            <li>The smell may seem a little strange at first, but let me be blunt: it&#x27;s better than the normal smell, trust me.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a lotion, so is easy to apply without any mess.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past the name, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I heard the commercial on Stern</li>
            <li>My only other suggestion is you may want more than one bottle to start with.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using this product and my wife is very grateful!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>but i used more than usual.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle (you have to peel off a tiny seal)</li>
            <li>first there seemed to be no effect but after a short while things kicked in</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I still rate it 5 stars because despite its inability to completely dry my swamp it did keep it smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me fresh and dry.  </li>
            <li>Now, they smell as fresh as spring and stay as dry as the Las Vegas heat.</li>
            <li>Fresh balls goes on like lotion and once dry keeps</li>
            <li>Keeps my man bits dry all day and fresh.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your swamp dry and feeling fresh, get this.</li>
            <li>KEEPS YOU FRESH AND DRY FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anybody looking to keep their &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>Keeps my guys dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>So fresh, so dry.</li>
            <li>A few days ago I was made aware of this for men that helps us stay fresh.</li>
            <li>I survived 4 days in the blistering heat and long walks of Bonnaroo in relative comfort and Fresh Balls is owed a large amount of credit for that.</li>
            <li>I have never used any other products, so I do not have much to compare, and will admit to buying due to the name, but I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good job of controlling odor - controlling excessive sweating in that area - not perfect, but still much better than powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It is clearly the old packaging, not the new design that is shown in the image.</li>
            <li>, it has \\&quot;waterlock\\&quot; (sodium polyacrlyate) to keep your balls extra dry and smooth and an antibacterial/microbial agent (Benzethonium Chloride) to keep them from smelling like, well, shweaty balls.</li>
            <li>This stuff really comes in handy on humid days where I live and keeps my drawers from sticking or making me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>This things works for the full day not a few hours like other products.  </li>
            <li>don´t have a terrible problem with sweaty cojones, but let´s just say that my boxers have a tendency to be very clingy and we all know how it feels like when balls (I can say it since the product says it) and boxers want to cuddle, it´s not the most pleasant feeling ever</li>
            <li>It does work, keeps things very dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>I was curious what exactly it does!</li>
            <li>Fresh balls does work, but is a much more expensive solution.</li>
            <li>Goldbond works way better but at least this stuff won&#x27;t give you nut cancer.</li>
            <li>there are some areas you are naturally supposed to sweat</li>
            <li>Getting back to the smell, you really can&#x27;t hide it.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>No sulfates, parabens, etc and lots of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to put any directly on the shaft in case</li>
            <li>my wife and I get intimate later that day and it happens to go in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I can go to work for 8 hours and have a modest amount of activity(walking,crawling around under equipment,etc)</li>
            <li>You may see the problem that developed.</li>
            <li>My two sons actually use this product and say it really works.  </li>
            <li>About 13$ for a tiny tube it too much for uses that you get for it</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOT WASTE OUR MONEY</li>
            <li>Use simple baby powder and you&#x27;ll be much happier</li>
            <li>I only found this out during the reception, when couples kept falling on the dance floor, thanks to my slippery trail of</li>
            <li>If you use a bit much it may leave a powdery residue in your underwear but that washes out easily enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how light or heavy</li>
            <li>(at least now you get more for your money.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only con is the instructions state you only need a dime size worth</li>
            <li>overall worth the extra cost for the benefits.</li>
            <li>was Dissapointed, first the product is super runny when it comes out of the tube, so it&#x27;s hard to control where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly</li>
            <li>I´m just saying, IF you get lucky one day and someone is to be down there for whatever reason, I have a feeling</li>
            <li>I loved this at first, but over time developed a bad rash.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer than powder, and there&#x27;s no mess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Things stay dry pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it were available at the drug store with out the heavy shipping penalty.&lt;br /&gt;Again those local distributors drive us to the net for our purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I sit in a chair for most of my day, and some days, it gets really hot, and therefore, uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>And it certainly lasted all day long</li>
            <li>The manufacturer replaced my four bad tubes and the new product is great again.</li>
            <li>It did nothing it was supposed to and was a complete waste of money; however, the purchase and receipt of the product went without a hitch and got to me quickly and without problem...</li>
            <li>Product goes on easily and cleanly, dries in a few seconds, and after drying it doesn&#x27;t cake or form too thick of a covering.  </li>
            <li>I found that if you use too much, it drys up your skin and causes an itch all day long.  </li>
            <li>As expected, this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>made a second purchase and the new containers were a bit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them several times and I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping me feeling differently!</li>
            <li>the illustration is for the original product which I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I think i get the same performance (maybe better) with goldbond powder, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>When I got back the results I was surprised to know that they my sperm was only 5% normal and there was a motility problem.</li>
            <li>Dries to a powder rather quickly and a very little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a lotion, then dries to what can only be describes as a fine dry powder; and it last all day long!</li>
            <li>, if you are anything like me or even have a little odor issue, get the Fresh Balls and Biz Wipes and you&#x27;ll never have odor issues again.</li>
            <li>am a young doctor (MD) that recently moved to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get to my least favorite part about this product, it&#x27;s leaves a very obvious white residue once it dries.</li>
            <li>Apply after the shower, dry all day even in high humidity summer days in the warehouse.</li>
            <li>With.fb if you put it on it will dry fast but it doesnt last all day.  </li>
            <li>When first applied there is a slight tingling sensation; that took getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I have recommend this product to 4 other friends in the past month and they all love it.  </li>
            <li>I just apply a little fresh balls and it lasts 16 hours if I work a double shift.</li>
            <li>Worked in the heat with ridiculous humidity, parties with vigorous dancing and even some light workouts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this any guy, whether you are active or just sitting on the couch, for an always fresh and dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the soft residue it leaves behind, a subtle reminder of how Fresh your balls are indeed.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint (something that really can&#x27;t be avoided when using a product like this) is that once the lotion turns to powder, you&#x27;ll find a bit of white dust in your boxers haha, not a huge deal, but it might look at little funny if you&#x27;re trying to stay fresh for someone</li>
            <li>Fresh balls come in a small tube  and you need to apply it liberally.</li>
            <li>After applying there is little mess as the residue left in my hand is negligible, and easily wiped away.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I was surprised that I was actually dry.</li>
            <li>This goes on like a lotion, but has a powder element that keeps the boys soft, dry, and touchable.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry thus far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really humid where I live (at least during the summer).</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep me very dry and smooth down south, it also got rid of the other problem I described in a little too much detail further up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be drenched in sweat, this product isn&#x27;t going to miraculously make your crotch dry, but in normal situations it keeps you dry and keeps skin from sticking together and chafing.  </li>
            <li>story short, I decided to give it a try, and to my surprise this is a really helpful little solution.</li>

            <li> It works GREAT.</li>

            <li> This stuff is very nice.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> My husband found this neither efficacious nor pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work good if you have a george bush downstairs.</li>
            <li> If the price hits $3.00/bottle, then its a good deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> and they even commented on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> def good product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t taste good for the ladies.</li>
            <li> and why not smell good for my GF.</li>
            <li> A good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I loved this idea and I wanted it to be the godsend</li>
            <li> good product&lt;</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;good , but not that good</li>
            <li> I read the good review in Mens health magazine.</li>
            <li> With these two working together, I am good to go anytime any place.</li>
            <li> You think these folks would&#x27;ve loved to been on Oprah or Dr. Phil to advertise this product?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stings a bit when going on, doesn&#x27;t work as well as a good powder (e.g. Balla)&lt;br /&gt;DEAL BREAKER:</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used relating to, well, having fresh balls.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting product.  </li>
            <li> No product is going to be perfect for everyone, but I found that Fresh Balls did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very very very pleased</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product was a featured item and SO HILARIOUS!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Interested to see how it performs in the legendary Arizona heat this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I&#x27;m about to order more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is better than powder!  </li>
            <li> If the powder gets on clothes, it rinses of wipes off fairly easily, and this can occur when using your fly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> An amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy..</li>
            <li> I had to supplement with powder which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I got to thinking, what kind of powder is used to absorb sweat and tackle bacteria:</li>
            <li> If you warm up though, you will still get swamp crotch.</li>
            <li> but im honest.</li>
            <li> The name of the product is kind of embarrassing (not the sort of thing I would ever want someone to see me buying/using), but it did get my attention.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Gold Bond or Baby Powder on my balls kind of guy.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it helps prolong the amount if time you have to race to the shower after a good workout. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Gave them as presents for Xmas to my gym rat kids they loved the fresh balls great for workouts prevents your jock rash</li>
            <li> and this was a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li> tingles when you put it on but does a nice job at removing smells.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave powder all over clothes or the floor.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled to say my decades-long agony is over.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> This product works mostly good and has a very nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in that it goes on easy (much better than applying a powder)and</li>
            <li> Fresh makes a HUGE improvement ... smells great !</li>
            <li> only that these are really good people but their product works perfect just as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re super happy with this.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to rinse off, and I didn&#x27;t smell anything after using all day.</li>
            <li> or more energetic!</li>
            <li> Great for hot summer days!  </li>
            <li> What can I say, my balls smell fresh, lol.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something easier to apply than a powder, but in my opinion the Gold Bond is much more effective.  </li>
            <li> Fresh Balls works great.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use as directed and you too, will have great success and freshness.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this and thought it&#x27;d be a great gag gift for my husband, but found very promising reviews.  </li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li> I at first thought it was a great product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, dries quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> Many years of jockitch because of the.moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this freaking product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, spend the $12.00 on a couple more drinks for the lady, and she won&#x27;t mind the swamp crotch anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> And the product smells okay.</li>
            <li> My balls have never felt better, If you have any balls at all you should try this product.</li>
            <li> sure they&#x27;d appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Was ok.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product, but I have to say I can tell a difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Im going to by more.</li>
            <li> I work in construction and sweat most days all day.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it more than he did.</li>
            <li> Its ok I guess.  </li>
            <li> If he does, I will be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \\&quot;powder puff\\&quot; to apply the powder under scrotum, etc.</li>
            <li> Prob better with boxers than briefs.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands after application though...</li>
            <li> Dont you think im so sexy?</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product and it worked ok when I tried it out.</li>
            <li> My ladies love it.</li>
            <li> You are better to do without.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I cannot say really if it better than the talc at absorption, but the product does work as described.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash your hands after applying or you&#x27;ll get ghost hands.</li>
            <li> product, glad it exists, customer for life.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better to keep and use after the gym to tide me over until I can get home but not for all day dryness.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your hands as soon as you apply the solution.  </li>
            <li> I love the weather here, but a tropical climate can wreak havic on your manhood.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I hit the clubs with a bit more confidence.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am sure they have sold a lot of product as a joke gift because of the name.</li>
            <li> You sale was everything I hoped for &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I think they should have gave it a more respectable name seeing as though guys like me have a wife and 2 daughters.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the next greatest thing in hygeine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more do you have to say.</li>
            <li> In my experience that&#x27;s where most of the odor comes from to begin with.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was not 100% sure if the product was causing the burning..</li>
            <li> Very nice and gentle aroma too.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product today for the first time and THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li> IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> worth the money!!  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and ended up using it more than him, rather than buying my own tube of the Fresh Boobs or whatever it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...definitely helps you stay dry.</li>
            <li> I found the best way to use the product is to apply, let it dry then get dressed.</li>
            <li> ...if you use &amp;#34;Balls&amp;#34;, you know it is effective, but may get a little stingy - this stuff works great to make things nice again.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh feeling all day</li>
            <li> Real fresh.</li>

            <li> This stuff does a good job keeping them dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all better buy stock in Fresh Balls, because my husband swears by this product!</li>
            <li> The product smells pleasant enough and I will say it is better than nothing, but it sure didn&#x27;t work miracles.</li>
            <li> It stays out of your way once it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy apply,lasts,my woman appreciates the non man smell,</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone, like me, who has to be outside walking around for many hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Functions well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No powdered sugar coating, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Although it did not have a strong scent I feel it should have.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is really strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts all day, prevents chafing, keeps him dry, and has a very pleasant light scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply this stuff to your scrotal section, and rejoice in the cool dryness bestowed on your balls by this ingenious product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finely I found a product that works</li>
            <li> The lotion has a pleasant smell (not girly) and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m fresh and lovely...</li>

            <li> smell and sweat free all day.</li>
            <li> It goes on like an ointment and dries to a light talc, but leaves no powder residue</li>
            <li> It gives a comfortable feeling for a minute,  then nothing.  </li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s great, gotta wash your hands tho because it leaves white marks on anything you touch.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the extra amount over the 3oz tube but the 30z tube is great for travellers who don;t check bags</li>
            <li> Recently one of my buddies was talking about this stuff saying how great it is and</li>
            <li> but then starts to become smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> my morning shower I coat my sack with this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> product is definitely worth a try -- just make sure you read the instructions</li>
            <li> This does not seem scientifically sound...</li>
            <li> Next month I&#x27;m meeting a woman who I met on a dating site and we already plan to have some great stories to remember.  </li>
            <li> and then it dries to a powder, like a light &#x27;dusting&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> save on shipping, (make it free)</li>
            <li> For the moment yes it works but for guys that  sweat more then others this will only be good to try it for your self.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today after a shower and this is the best I felt for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Although it is nice to not use messy powders for ones body, FB does not work nearly as good as most powders.</li>
            <li> A very clean fresh feeling still existed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, no more batwing, feels great.  </li>
            <li> Its super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It applies like a cream or lotion but quickly dries into a powder, so that makes it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll more than likely be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and washes away easily.</li>
            <li> If you want the original product this is not what you will be getting.</li>

            <li> I want the original in the silver tube.</li>

            <li> I originally heard about it on the radio as part of a joke.</li>
            <li> Underground miner and his balls stay so fresh for 12 hours!</li>
            <li> FB is a good solution for VERY mild sweat, for instance, if you have a sedentary job in a cool building with temperate-to-cold weather outside.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use more than just a very thin layer, and it works awesome.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries quickly and works all day.</li>
            <li> stars, it keeps me happy, keeps me dry.</li>

            <li> Does a great job of keeping things dry.</li>
            <li> so certainly my wife would be able to.</li>
            <li> This stuff works SO incredibly well, and each bottle lasts a little longer than a</li>
            <li> putting this on is easy, put on, let dry and good to go.</li>
            <li> I understand the laugh and all, and it is funny as hell, but I think a lot more consideration and an awareness should&#x27;ve been taken considering.  </li>
            <li> product relieved much of the ball chafing and almost all of the ball stank in a way that Gold Bond has just never been able to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contaced them and explained the situation.&lt;br /&gt;They expressed their sincer appologies and mailed me a free \\&quot;fresh</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep tube stored upright on cap otherwise when you squeeze it out will get too much at one time.</li>
            <li> It did leave that area smelling nice and feeling soft though.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for Howie Mandel, it&#x27;s good enough for me..  </li>
            <li> For now, back to good ol&#x27; cornstarch.</li>
            <li> Not as good as powder for me but its a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Instead of me just storing it in the place where all of my manly products are stored, in full view of my family, I have to hide it so that my daughters will not see it.  </li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li> It works great for me, keeping me feeling dry and fresh all day no matter the work conditions.</li>

            <li> Nothing keeps the boys as fresh as Fresh Balls!</li>
            <li> just so fresh and clean..</li>
            <li> , im just so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> He seriously talks about how awesome it is all the time.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a moisturizer but dries quickly into a powder.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail quickly and it works just the way it says it does.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> but quickly realized the musky smell the testes give off when working or working out(heck</li>
            <li> This product is only good if you are fresh out the shower and about to get freaky and you wanna be fresh for the moment.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancé who is a mechanic and it&#x27;s been very hot and powder clumps and gets all over.</li>
            <li> the old design.&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty good, but the packaging graphics are pretty tacky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid powder that is easy to apply and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I have used baby powder to stay dry, and to stop chaffing which works really good.</li>
            <li> Not that I needed any, but have received many a compliment and it has lasted a year so far!</li>
            <li> So fresh and so dry is good stuff keeps you fresh all day</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic alternative that lasts much longer than powders and doesn&#x27;t leave you with glue if you do get too</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t exactly fresh either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Fresh Balls three stars because it works somewhat.</li>

            <li> Is it worth the try??</li>
            <li> I dont mind dealing with my husbands balls after he uses fresh balls.</li>
            <li> The price was rather steep, but I figured if it worked, it would be well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Thank You fresh balls.</li>
            <li> It has a baby fresh scent and gives my balls a silky feel that the girls</li>
            <li> and the baby fresh smell was gone.</li>
            <li> The company made an error and shipped me two fresh balls.</li>
            <li> The product may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Thank you Fresh Balls for the dryness and fresh smell.</li>

            <li> immediately ordered Fresh Balls from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> to their claim it keeps things fresh.</li>
            <li> Once the lotion drys, things stay fresh.</li>
            <li> seems to work...smells fresh...</li>
            <li> Now, I start my day with a fresh shower, and a fresh scrotum</li>
            <li> after a 5-hour long show, we were both very satisfied with its results when he let me &amp;#34;relieve his tension.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> My friend let me try a dab of his Fresh Balls one night before hitting the night clubs.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Fresh</li>
            <li> As far as the performance goes, I can&#x27;t say if it reduces odor or not, but it does not perform any better than baby power for moisture control.</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s a useful gag gift?</li>
            <li> So fresh, you&#x27;ll want one at home and in the gym bag.</li>

            <li> breast\\&quot; right</li>
            <li> , neither is it always the right place and time to start digging to separate the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I applied it after drying myself right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Right before exercise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have Goldbond powder all over the toilet seat and floor when I go to use the bathroom after my husband has just showered.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I really like and easy application.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, fresh, and dry going on...</li>
            <li> This product works great, keeps them dry for the day and much better than baby powder and other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that functions as well as (if not better than)</li>
            <li> grey colored package was effective; the orange is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> really nice not having to adjust them all day long.!</li>
            <li> And throughout the day I honestly notice my balls are dry.</li>
            <li> Here at freshballs we take pride in using natural products that not only solve the problem, but they are good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves me slightly dryer than nothing but not as good as powder.</li>
            <li> It does work, and keeps my guys nice and dry.</li>
            <li> It does smell better then those, but I don&#x27;t believe that is worth paying that much extra for.</li>
            <li> I dont use it every day but mainly for special occasions or times</li>
            <li> Keeps my sac nice and dry during these hot, humid Nashville days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it &amp;#34;balls up&amp;#34; less than talcum powder and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot and humid in most of the places he goes and when in full uniform for long hours, you can imagine the discomfort.</li>
            <li> No sticky, no odor, nothing but dry freshness and an awesome feeling down there.</li>
            <li> Depending on what you do during your day you may need to freshen up, but Fresh Balls certainly makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> foot powder, Odor Eater&#x27;s Foot Powder to be exact.</li>
            <li> (imagine the hot sun shining on your lap all day)</li>
            <li> We first learned of this product when Howie Mandell talked about it on a talk show.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes the product and says that it works to prevent the chaffing that occurs in our hot, humid summers.  </li>
            <li> He will definitely be ordering more of this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> am not the first to state this.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks it&#x27;s a joke at first but becomes a believer after the first application.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I save it for a hot date night.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> having people look at you funny when you start putting some on in the locker room...</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick as I don&#x27;t see him adjusting himself unceremoniously in public any more.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I put some underneath my scrotum, at the top and between my legs, where they touch together.</li>
            <li> No weird smells coming from his undercarriage either.  </li>
            <li> Here is my honest review: This product works very well to keep the boys dry and clean smelling under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> Not 100% but pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> Working retail I&#x27;m walking around a lot and sometimes the building just gets hot</li>
            <li> it keeps him from &amp;#34;smelling&amp;#34; after a hot day ;)</li>
            <li> It gets hot and sweaty around these (and those) parts.</li>
            <li> Feels liquidity going on and for the first 15 minutes after application  </li>
            <li> I used to use gold bond but that cakes up and smells funny</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> (I bought my first tube 10 days ago).</li>
            <li> When you first try it, your thoughts are \\&quot;Hmm...</li>
            <li> the more traditional alternatives.  </li>
            <li> thanks to the Fresh Balls solution.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product needs to be out in public more.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more as soon as this one gets low</li>
            <li> (which looks like it&#x27;ll last a while, it doesn&#x27;t take much more than a</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Okay, so my intent is not to be gross but simply to illustrate how much I love this</li>
            <li> Tried the product the first day I received it.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll update this review if anything unusual is mentioned about the Fresh Balls...</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Crisp Balls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this as something funny for my husbands stocking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hot as hell here...</li>
            <li> Bought this because I work in a prison and it gets hot during the summer and with lots of walking around well, you get the idea.</li>
            <li> but with this I am good to go all day unless I go to the gym or walk a few miles in the summer</li>
            <li> works great, lasts a long time during those hot n sweaty moments, keeps you feeling just like it says, fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> You have to use quite a bit of it for it to be moderately effective, and reapplication on the fly is pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li> word of caution: dry off before applying LOL, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get what feels like white lint on your scrotum.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and most of the time I free ball because it is keeps things dry.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth, dries to mess free powdered finish!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, goes on wet but ends up like a powder!?</li>
            <li> Nice drying and slight menthol refreshing feeling upon application and shortly after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Review title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a lotion and dries pretty fast to a powder.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t live in too hot of an area!</li>
            <li> It keeps him dry and comfortable during the very hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job of keeping you dry.</li>
            <li> got this on a friends recommendation and I am very pleased with the way it works, totally kills the swamp problem I get while working outside at my job.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re dry, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting on a soothing invisible layer of magical angel whispers.</li>
            <li> Following the first administration, within minutes my crotch was feeling so comfortable again.</li>
            <li> Keeps em&#x27; feeling like i just got outta the shower for pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li> a large amount spurted out of the opening.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Even by the end of the next work day the boys are dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li> The old formula worked, the new formula leaves you wet and sticky and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> At this point In my recovery I&#x27;m pretty sure my wife would have divorced me (or at least would be sleeping in the guest room) without fresh balls, so thank you!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to our boys in uniform everywhere!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I was devastated, withdrwan and I really didn&#x27;t talk to the people around me</li>
            <li> The light fragrance is back</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does stop the odor and the sweat!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and if I am taking time to get ready I will use this.</li>
            <li> ALso I had a whole tube taken from me at Heathrow because it is 5oz.</li>
            <li> Hey, much to my surprise</li>
            <li> He commented that he really likes it, that it, &amp;#34;keeps him from sticking.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After discovering that it wasn&#x27;t available locally, I ordered it from an Amazon Merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it sounds like a gag gift, but it really works.</li>
            <li> maybe because no one else wants it as they knew how it would work???</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My husband is a guitar player and always complains about how much he sweats while jumping around on stage.  </li>
            <li> It makes him much more&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to that evening.</li>
            <li> Thanks I luv my purchase</li>
            <li> I havent tried it in the summer yet, that will be the real test.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It costs way too much for the amount given.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Dont be cheap and buy Johnsons &amp; Johnsons powder...will not do the same...</li>
            <li> if it at least smell good</li>
            <li> It may work for mild wetting but when you have to work long hours involving many physical labor</li>
            <li> the new container is a garish orange (think Tide box) and medium blue which seems even less attractive graphically then</li>
            <li> Better than baby powder, gold bond and any other item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it, it gives a nice chilling sense, and clean aroma.</li>
            <li> No longer will they worry that they may not be &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough when looking for Ms. Right!</li>
            <li> I am a different person at work and I am definately more social with the girls</li>
            <li> I am sweat free ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> Just makes you feel so fresh and clean down there and guess what NO WETNESS.</li>
            <li> If this was a $3 item, I would probably keep using it as I search for something better, but at $12-15 a tube (which lasts about two months if you don&#x27;t use it too liberally), I think I&#x27;ll just try a liquid cornstarch type lotion for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The product sort of feels like a smooth lotion that you put on your hands when they get too dry.  </li>
            <li> After the day is over with you are left with mild sweaty balls and flakes in your underware.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, smells decent, you don&#x27;t notice its there except you don&#x27;t chaf like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to apply than powder, and does seem to keep things cool and dry.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product with high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> In spite of the high price I tried it</li>
            <li> The product is of high quality and applies like lotion.</li>
            <li> Finally a cure for a hot chef!  </li>
            <li> but you have to put a little more then a quarter of the product before you get your unit fully covered.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just unique to me, but in my experience the dry effect would wear off within 3-4 hours if that</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and fresh all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy and does not take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Underwear and blue jeans did not rub and the crease between my legs and body was calm.</li>
            <li> I tried Fresh Balls for a solid week</li>
            <li> I am now placing my THIRD order for Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li> I totally remembered the name of course, since it does have quite a fun</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I saw Howie Mandel pitching the virtues of Fresh Balls on Jay Leno&#x27;s show one night, and was intrigued.</li>
            <li> follow the directions just as described and honestly you don&#x27;t need to re-apply for at least 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> I have used Fresh Balls for a while now and they only con about it</li>
            <li> Fast forward to the first several uses: his balls feel like they are kept in a laboratory desiccator!  </li>
            <li> I would usually wait until after a shower to be intimate and those aren&#x27;t always the most convenient times.</li>
            <li> only then did I realize the awesomeness of Fresh balls.  </li>
            <li> So my gal got this for me as a gag gift after we saw a documentary where fresh balls was apart of it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest searching for other liquid talc products if you want something that does its job just fine in this area.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend Fresh Balls to any guy looking to keep cool and dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and it keeps things dry and fresh longer than any powder or lotion.</li>
            <li> Fresh Balls, I dry the area very well, to start, often even using a hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on you or your clothes, just make sure to apply it while you are DRY.</li>
            <li> As promised this product helps keep your crotch dry and sweet.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and do a lot of driving for my job</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li> I live in Orlando Florida</li>
            <li> I think that FB lessens the swamp crotch, and helps it dry quickly.</li>
            <li> And for personal hygiene, is their really a thing as spending too much?  </li>
            <li> The smell may seem a little strange at first, but let me be blunt: it&#x27;s better than the normal smell, trust me.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a lotion, so is easy to apply without any mess.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past the name, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li> The first time I heard the commercial on Stern</li>
            <li> My only other suggestion is you may want more than one bottle to start with.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this product and my wife is very grateful!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> but i used more than usual.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle (you have to peel off a tiny seal)</li>
            <li> first there seemed to be no effect but after a short while things kicked in</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I still rate it 5 stars because despite its inability to completely dry my swamp it did keep it smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me fresh and dry.  </li>
            <li> Now, they smell as fresh as spring and stay as dry as the Las Vegas heat.</li>
            <li> Fresh balls goes on like lotion and once dry keeps</li>
            <li> Keeps my man bits dry all day and fresh.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your swamp dry and feeling fresh, get this.</li>
            <li> KEEPS YOU FRESH AND DRY FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody looking to keep their &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps my guys dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> So fresh, so dry.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I was made aware of this for men that helps us stay fresh.</li>
            <li> I survived 4 days in the blistering heat and long walks of Bonnaroo in relative comfort and Fresh Balls is owed a large amount of credit for that.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other products, so I do not have much to compare, and will admit to buying due to the name, but I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good job of controlling odor - controlling excessive sweating in that area - not perfect, but still much better than powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It is clearly the old packaging, not the new design that is shown in the image.</li>
            <li> , it has \\&quot;waterlock\\&quot; (sodium polyacrlyate) to keep your balls extra dry and smooth and an antibacterial/microbial agent (Benzethonium Chloride) to keep them from smelling like, well, shweaty balls.</li>
            <li> This stuff really comes in handy on humid days where I live and keeps my drawers from sticking or making me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This things works for the full day not a few hours like other products.  </li>
            <li> don´t have a terrible problem with sweaty cojones, but let´s just say that my boxers have a tendency to be very clingy and we all know how it feels like when balls (I can say it since the product says it) and boxers want to cuddle, it´s not the most pleasant feeling ever</li>
            <li> It does work, keeps things very dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was curious what exactly it does!</li>
            <li> Fresh balls does work, but is a much more expensive solution.</li>
            <li> Goldbond works way better but at least this stuff won&#x27;t give you nut cancer.</li>
            <li> there are some areas you are naturally supposed to sweat</li>
            <li> Getting back to the smell, you really can&#x27;t hide it.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> No sulfates, parabens, etc and lots of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to put any directly on the shaft in case</li>
            <li> my wife and I get intimate later that day and it happens to go in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I can go to work for 8 hours and have a modest amount of activity(walking,crawling around under equipment,etc)</li>
            <li> You may see the problem that developed.</li>
            <li> My two sons actually use this product and say it really works.  </li>
            <li> About 13$ for a tiny tube it too much for uses that you get for it</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT WASTE OUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Use simple baby powder and you&#x27;ll be much happier</li>
            <li> I only found this out during the reception, when couples kept falling on the dance floor, thanks to my slippery trail of</li>
            <li> If you use a bit much it may leave a powdery residue in your underwear but that washes out easily enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how light or heavy</li>
            <li> (at least now you get more for your money.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con is the instructions state you only need a dime size worth</li>
            <li> overall worth the extra cost for the benefits.</li>
            <li> was Dissapointed, first the product is super runny when it comes out of the tube, so it&#x27;s hard to control where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly</li>
            <li> I´m just saying, IF you get lucky one day and someone is to be down there for whatever reason, I have a feeling</li>
            <li> I loved this at first, but over time developed a bad rash.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than powder, and there&#x27;s no mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Things stay dry pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it were available at the drug store with out the heavy shipping penalty.&lt;br /&gt;Again those local distributors drive us to the net for our purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I sit in a chair for most of my day, and some days, it gets really hot, and therefore, uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> And it certainly lasted all day long</li>
            <li> The manufacturer replaced my four bad tubes and the new product is great again.</li>
            <li> It did nothing it was supposed to and was a complete waste of money; however, the purchase and receipt of the product went without a hitch and got to me quickly and without problem...</li>
            <li> Product goes on easily and cleanly, dries in a few seconds, and after drying it doesn&#x27;t cake or form too thick of a covering.  </li>
            <li> I found that if you use too much, it drys up your skin and causes an itch all day long.  </li>
            <li> As expected, this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> made a second purchase and the new containers were a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them several times and I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping me feeling differently!</li>
            <li> the illustration is for the original product which I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I think i get the same performance (maybe better) with goldbond powder, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> When I got back the results I was surprised to know that they my sperm was only 5% normal and there was a motility problem.</li>
            <li> Dries to a powder rather quickly and a very little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a lotion, then dries to what can only be describes as a fine dry powder; and it last all day long!</li>
            <li> , if you are anything like me or even have a little odor issue, get the Fresh Balls and Biz Wipes and you&#x27;ll never have odor issues again.</li>
            <li> am a young doctor (MD) that recently moved to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get to my least favorite part about this product, it&#x27;s leaves a very obvious white residue once it dries.</li>
            <li> Apply after the shower, dry all day even in high humidity summer days in the warehouse.</li>
            <li> With.fb if you put it on it will dry fast but it doesnt last all day.  </li>
            <li> When first applied there is a slight tingling sensation; that took getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I have recommend this product to 4 other friends in the past month and they all love it.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a little fresh balls and it lasts 16 hours if I work a double shift.</li>
            <li> Worked in the heat with ridiculous humidity, parties with vigorous dancing and even some light workouts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this any guy, whether you are active or just sitting on the couch, for an always fresh and dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the soft residue it leaves behind, a subtle reminder of how Fresh your balls are indeed.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (something that really can&#x27;t be avoided when using a product like this) is that once the lotion turns to powder, you&#x27;ll find a bit of white dust in your boxers haha, not a huge deal, but it might look at little funny if you&#x27;re trying to stay fresh for someone</li>
            <li> Fresh balls come in a small tube  and you need to apply it liberally.</li>
            <li> After applying there is little mess as the residue left in my hand is negligible, and easily wiped away.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I was surprised that I was actually dry.</li>
            <li> This goes on like a lotion, but has a powder element that keeps the boys soft, dry, and touchable.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry thus far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really humid where I live (at least during the summer).</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep me very dry and smooth down south, it also got rid of the other problem I described in a little too much detail further up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be drenched in sweat, this product isn&#x27;t going to miraculously make your crotch dry, but in normal situations it keeps you dry and keeps skin from sticking together and chafing.  </li>
            <li> story short, I decided to give it a try, and to my surprise this is a really helpful little solution.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t abnormally sweat, and I did notice a slight difference at first, but it is not really working the way it is described.</li>
            <li> I usually get a rash in the groin area, due to sweet and heat not today.</li>
            <li> Summer, winter, hot weather or cold it happens and nothing would give me more than a few minutes relief.</li>
            <li> This product really does work - it seems a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I sweat a lot in the hot weather and this seemed like something I would really appreciate.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the other positive reviews I may just be the odd one out</li>
            <li> I put this on after a shower and my balls stay fresh, dry and odor-free for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Even just being out in a hot day it sucks.</li>
            <li> No more sweaty balls and it reduces odor as well after intense workouts and runs.</li>
            <li> It does leave a wierd residue but its no more unsightly or unusual than having powder all over.</li>
            <li> Freshballs just doesnt last nearly as long as powder,</li>
            <li> This just flat out didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it you get a little \\&quot;heat\\&quot; going on down there.</li>
            <li> stuff doesnt last very long after it dries, burns like heck on yer &amp;#34;dangly bits&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The lotion dries in a few minutes (yes, at first it was uncomfortable with wetness where I wanted it dry, but as I said, it dries quickly).</li>
            <li> also discovered that if you unscrew and remove the cap (instead of flipping it up) and dispense it directly from the plastic \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; without the cap on, you don&#x27;t end up with a crusty mess on the container or&lt;br /&gt;powdery</li>
            <li> Yes, i could use powder if I really wanted to stay dry, but powder is messy, and ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep me very dry and its only January.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be embarassed; we all get a little humid near the equator.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when working out or playing sports things get a little chafed up in the manly region.  </li>
            <li> I will give this product one thing: it does have antibacterial properties so your balls will smell less, but as far as keeping them dry...</li>
            <li> I thought that it would go on like a lotion, but later dry and keep me dry the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any odd odor emitting from the solution, but there is a slight smell.  </li>
            <li> It took too long for.the item to be.shipped.</li>
            <li> Working on roofs in Louisiana during the Summer in long pants without sweaty balls is an impossibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before using product, I had problems with my legs chafing during long stretches at work.</li>
            <li> Bonus is that this is actually not a chemical laden product like I expected.  </li>
            <li> hopefull for long term solution ..</li>
            <li> I had often found my balls sweating after a long days work.</li>
            <li> After a long day, every guy produces wetness in his groin area.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Monkey Butt all the time</li>
            <li> it is cheaper than Monkey Butt.  </li>
            <li> This also led to me being unable to take a full shower without extensive preparation.</li>
            <li> Normally at work my balls get very sweaty and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work, but it does leave residue in your clothing, not to mention a big mess on hands after application.</li>
            <li> While my balls remained dry the crease between my balls and my leg was moist with sweat before long.</li>
            <li> Fresh Balls kept me as dry if not more so than any other product I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was sold in a bigger quantity other then 3oz</li>
            <li> The product is similar to other liquid talc/liquid baby powder products, except w/o the name.</li>
            <li> keeps you dry and chafe-free for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Keeps area dry.</li>
            <li> for some reason it doesn&#x27;t dry, it gets creamy there</li>
            <li> I stay dry all day.</li>
            <li> does the job, takes a minute or two to dry, but once it does, it keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; dry and prevents sweat while doing activities that cause body heat.</li>
            <li> Dry Balls.</li>
            <li> his balls stay dry all the time.</li>
            <li> today I was dry as a bone with no rash.</li>
            <li> This product did not keep dry as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep you dry</li>
            <li> It keeps &#x27;everything&#x27; dry even during ranges or out on patrol in Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> It does nothing to help me stay dry compared to baby powder.</li>
            <li> Keeps you balls dry.</li>
            <li> But when I apply this stuff to you know where, I stay dry....</li>
            <li> I let it dry (about two minutes) and put my clothes on.</li>
            <li> Keeps the fellas dry through out the day.</li>
            <li> Its is just uncomfortable to apply a liquid there after showering and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using regular arm deodorant on my scrotum and perineal area for the last few months since moving to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical that a simple lotion could make a huge impact on this issue.</li>
            <li> Talcum powder in general is just messy</li>
            <li> Leaves white powder marks in dark underwear at end of day.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that I left a white trail of dried powder falling through my trousers wherever I went that entire day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has that weird smell of lotion though, but luckily not too strong.</li>
            <li> Keeping dry should not be at the expense of burning parts!</li>
            <li> Just apply a little dab to some problematic areas and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well it keeps you dry and especially no smell..</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s job in that it keeps your actual balls dry for a little while.</li>
            <li> The product does NOT keep you very dry, though.</li>
            <li> While it does leave a white powdery mess on your undergarments...it does prevent chaffing.  </li>
            <li> several weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that while it definitely helps to keep things drier, if you do heavy activity, you well get sweaty down there</li>
            <li> this product weren&#x27;t so expensive for such a small tube I would be willing to try another, but for me I will stick to body powder because its about 10x cheaper even though it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I concluded that it was because I had a #2 a little earlier.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that at the end of the day, I had a bit of dust on my socks as the day&#x27;s movement had removed some of the product and it shifted down my legs (beware if you wear boxers!).</li>
            <li> Makes long days in the Arizona heat not so SWAMPY!!!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s in the military and has to travel all over.</li>
            <li> I would recommend also purchasing flushable wet naps for removal / cleanup.</li>
            <li> Never got used to it going on wet and then drying.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> I reverted back to Gold Bond powder in the green packaging.</li>
            <li> Its not as powdery as I expected and didn&#x27;t seem to reduce moisture at all.  </li>
            <li> But be careful that you aren&#x27;t one of us that can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much like it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say about this: it works.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, the solution dries up and converts to a white powdery substance.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that it is made of talcum power in a wet mixture because it dries like baby power.</li>
            <li> I have been using Anti-Monkey-Butt for over  a year and after a military friend who spent some time in Afghanistan traveled to Las Vegas with me...</li>
            <li> She got down on her knees and pants down took a deep sniff of the area...</li>
            <li> Goldbond et al would only leave me dry for a few hours typically,</li>
            <li> The new formula is not good, it dose not keep it dry down there.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a swampland down there.</li>
            <li> Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is the small amounts wasted every day when I open the cap.</li>
            <li> We all suffer the same problem of getting a little moist down below.</li>
            <li> This product eliminates that wetness, HOWEVER, only use a little!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my bathroom isn&#x27;t covered in dust after I use it.</li>
            <li> and it was unable to keep my sack dry, at all, no matter how much I applied.</li>
            <li> This product does not have the same negative side effects of continuing to use talc powder (dry and itchy skin).</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried almost every product out there to keep his boys fresh and dry, with much disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I go to use some, some of the liquid has solidified in the tube so it makes a mess with dried white crust breaking off the packaging, which is also rather wasteful.</li>
            <li> This stuff costs a lot for such a small amount, but I had to try it.</li>
            <li> The product shipped was in a different container, orange color, and I have tried it in the past.  </li>
            <li> Either make the bottle bigger for the same price, of lower the price on the same sized bottle and ill</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this stuff when I first read about it in a men&#x27;s magazine</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I will look into picking up their other products</li>
            <li> /&gt;FreshBalls was created to take care of the problems the other companies forgot about.</li>
            <li> She said there was only a small hint of odor.</li>
            <li> after a trip to southeast asia, I used it due to the humidity and my tendency to sweat profusely.  </li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the other issue is the application.</li>
            <li> No more fidgeting or scratching in public or at work.</li>
            <li> I have had children recently within the past two years.</li>
            <li> With FB there is little to no smell and your package is kept bone dry for well over a day.  </li>
            <li> Did a bit of research on a reliable way to shaving the boys down there without using clippers or doing a wet shave when I came across the Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply it immediately after a shower, wait a few min to dry off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d like to feel down there</li>
            <li> Until I discovered this product, I used to load on the \\&quot;after shower\\&quot; dry powder stuff and what a mess that was!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to hide smells that come from bodily fluids.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> It changed my like now I can get back to performing delicate surgery instead scratching all the time</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> After a knee injury I was given a straight leg brace and unable to put pressure on my leg.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about the product is the price of it.</li>
            <li> FLABBY LOOSE TO FIRM AND TIGHT</li>
            <li> and smells like i just threw on some cologne down there.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAD THE PROBLEM WITH SWEATING DOWN</li>
            <li> down there -</li>
            <li> Not a smell I want going on down there.</li>
            <li> Just a slight tingle.</li>
            <li> I bought a black car with leather seats.</li>
            <li> product goes on like a lotion, and when it dries it works like powder, except you don&#x27;t have the mess that powder leaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No powder mess.</li>
            <li> No more wet crotch that gets irritated.</li>
            <li> makes a mess of your underwear.</li>
            <li> Think a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Rub a nickel size amount underneath, and a little on the \\&quot;top\\&quot; where my penis might hang.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does work well.  </li>
            <li> Wherever you get a little damp.</li>
            <li> Use a little care and there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> Little caking when applied</li>
            <li> but it does work for a little while however</li>
            <li> he said use a little dab..</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> $10 for a small jar is a bit expensive, I could buy a few bottles of baby powder for the same price and it would last longer.  </li>
            <li> It is a little messy out of the container, and it leaves a chalky residue on his &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; Otherwise thr product works as it was described.</li>
            <li> Orange and blue tube of pure crap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 9 MAY 2011 I don&#x27;t know what happened but the last batch of this stuff I bought (four tubes) was way too thin</li>
            <li> and it didnt cover the sweat or the smell after a workout was a waste of money it all hype</li>
            <li> I use this product when I run or bike for a few miles.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I decided to give it a try, I received my tube a few days ago and to tell you the truth, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Just after a few days ...</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse then peeling your ball sack off your inner thigh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You use it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> dried product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used gold bond in the past, but, it&#x27;s a mess and clumps with any moisture.</li>
            <li> other reviews complained about.  </li>
            <li> I have used fresh balls for a few weeks, and am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> but, it is sloppy to use and a little goes a long WAY.</li>
            <li> I must say, I am a taken man and I no longer have that fear or embarrassment to have my girlfriend go down on me, even after a hard rigorous work out.  </li>
            <li> Now, if I have a hard workout at the gym,mowing the grass or anything that may cause an extreme sweat I noticed very little moisture, but not much and amazingly NO musty smell!</li>
            <li> i would dry off with a towel, put clean clothes on, and then I would start sweating again, making it miserable to go out on a date or wherever.</li>
            <li> I sometimes work in hot and miserable conditions, and when I get home I can barely stand the stench.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s too thin now, it takes forever to dry and without the fragrance, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite weird</li>
            <li> I dont know if you have seen a porno in the past 10 years, but the \\&quot;bush\\&quot; administration is over.</li>
            <li> Take back your life and buy this product, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I almost always shower at night before bed and rub a small amount on my boys before bed.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical, saw this featured on a documentary, and thought to my self &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Since we are some of those green people who care about stuff like that, he might even use it!  </li>
            <li> Any small excess that leaves the bottle will harden and crumbles off as dust.</li>
            <li> Usually get about 5-6 hours out of it without any exercise before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> no more powder all over the place...</li>
            <li> I was anxious to know if it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> But because of the name they gave it could potentially turn networks and consumers off or rubbed some the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say while sitting around all day \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; got a little sweaty and after a few days a little \\&quot;stanky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and you will learn the hard way if you apply too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its hard to try to get people to try it out...</li>
            <li> I would take at least 6 trips to the bathroom per day</li>
            <li> but it sucks</li>
            <li> Lately, noticed discomfort with walking and climbing stairs.</li>
            <li> For years I have suffered (and I mean SUFFERED) with my sack sticking to my legs.</li>
            <li> - Very few; it is initially messy to apply and it is relatively expensive compared to a well known powder for instance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a serious sweater.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if it was sold in MUCH less expensive jumbo tubes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little expensive but it does work.  </li>
            <li> Plus your laundry doesn&#x27;t smell so bad which is a big plus</li>
            <li> not sure why its weird, but what ever.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after I got sick of the messiness of using talc powders to keep my boys dry.</li>
            <li> my balls were not all sweaty as usual!!</li>
            <li> If you are tired of dealing with excess powder on the floor and the cloud that follows you, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worse than batwings!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously just what the it&#x27;s complicated prescribed.</li>
            <li> When I heard about this product, I had to try it because I HATE sweating down there.</li>
            <li> after about a month it started to smell really bad to the point where it was not suitable for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to be sort of silly</li>
            <li> sorry if thats TMI, but thats what we are talking about here...</li>
            <li> Just FYI - just use on your balls, not the shaft, just feels weird.</li>
            <li> Apply for comfort before it gets uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I admit, I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> No more awkward walking or standing for this guy!</li>
            <li> So I thought it would be weird to &amp;#34;lotion up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> While expensive....</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t bad just not pleasant because you don&#x27;t want your balls to smell like anything.</li>
            <li> go too crazy with it though..</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say the results were disappointing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad tube.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad batch of it?</li>
            <li> oh well :-(</li>
            <li> I hate to bash products</li>
            <li> The stuff I got is crap.</li>
            <li> This crap gave me a rash</li>
            <li> Hated when my nuts would always stick to the sides of my legs and get that pungent, glorious ball smell by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I hated the cloud of talc that came with applying it though.</li>
            <li> Stupid name though!  </li>
            <li> Just terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unbelievable product works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite weird how well this works. If you don&#x27;t want to fuss with Gold Bond powder, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This product is a godsend. Many years of jockitch because of the.moisture. All gone after one use. I love this freaking product.</li>
            <li> This product works great, keeps them dry for the day and much better than baby powder and other alternatives. Would Recommend</li>
            <li> It works great! He&#x27;s in the military and has to travel all over. Gets pretty hot and humid in most of the places he goes and when in full uniform for long hours, you can imagine the discomfort. Highly recommend this to our boys in uniform everywhere!</li>
            <li> Dries to a clumpy consistency even after I shook it up per the label. The smell isn&#x27;t exactly fresh either.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job of keeping you dry. Goldbond works way better but at least this stuff won&#x27;t give you nut cancer.</li>
            <li> Seriously just what the it&#x27;s complicated prescribed. Now I&#x27;m fresh and lovely...</li>
            <li> Do I have to be the jerk that tells people that this stuff doesn&#x27;t work? I will give this product one thing: it does have antibacterial properties so your balls will smell less, but as far as keeping them dry... That&#x27;s another story. I tried Fresh Balls for a solid week and it was unable to keep my sack dry, at all, no matter how much I applied. I had to supplement with powder which kind of defeats the purpose. I have found the solution, however. I got to thinking, what kind of powder is used to absorb sweat and tackle bacteria: foot powder, Odor Eater&#x27;s Foot Powder to be exact. Not only is it made with cornstarch so you don&#x27;t have to worry about asbestos/talc issues, it has \\&quot;waterlock\\&quot; (sodium polyacrlyate) to keep your balls extra dry and smooth and an antibacterial/microbial agent (Benzethonium Chloride) to keep them from smelling like, well, shweaty balls.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have been using it for years. However a note. Shave/trim your junk. This stuff does not work good if you have a george bush downstairs. But, this should not be a problem. This is not the 70. I dont know if you have seen a porno in the past 10 years, but the \\&quot;bush\\&quot; administration is over. Love my fresh balls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Fresh Balls three stars because it works somewhat. It&#x27;s great in that it goes on easy (much better than applying a powder)and keeps you dry and chafe-free for a couple of hours. The product does NOT keep you very dry, though. FB is a good solution for VERY mild sweat, for instance, if you have a sedentary job in a cool building with temperate-to-cold weather outside.  If you warm up though, you will still get swamp crotch. I think that FB lessens the swamp crotch, and helps it dry quickly. If the price hits $3.00/bottle, then its a good deal. Otherwise, spend the $12.00 on a couple more drinks for the lady, and she won&#x27;t mind the swamp crotch anyway.</li>
            <li> keeps your Boys COOOOL!!</li>
            <li> Item works great. Keeps area dry. Fast shipping. Would highly recommend product. Have used product for almost a year. A must for athletes.</li>
            <li> We all suffer the same problem of getting a little moist down below. Well that is no longer a problem. I read an article that intrigued me to get some Fresh Balls. It works! Just apply a little dab to some problematic areas and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well it keeps you dry and especially no smell..yuck!&lt;br /&gt;Dont go too crazy with it though..there are some areas you are naturally supposed to sweat and you will learn the hard way if you apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love it. I dont use it every day but mainly for special occasions or times I know I&#x27;ll be sweating my &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li> I hate to bash products but im honest. It took too long for.the item to be.shipped. And the product smells okay. It has a minty foot scrub smell. With.fb if you put it on it will dry fast but it doesnt last all day.  Nor does it work at all under your belly for us big guys. After the day is over with you are left with mild sweaty balls and flakes in your underware. This product is only good if you are fresh out the shower and about to get freaky and you wanna be fresh for the moment.  For the moment yes it works but for guys that  sweat more then others this will only be good to try it for your self. Is it worth the try?? Yes.  They just need a stronger formula and different scents to chhose from.</li>
            <li> It lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> This product worked better than expected. Make sure you use as directed and you too, will have great success and freshness. It will give you great comfort on hot days and in hot and active situations.</li>
            <li> Pros - goes on as a lotion that dries to a powder. Being a lotion, it allows one to achieve good coverage without a cloud of powder in the air, or worrying about it showing on your clothing, Lightly scented - no strong Eucalyptus scent that screams: &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve got Jock Rot!&amp;#34; to the ladies. Does a good job of controlling odor - controlling excessive sweating in that area - not perfect, but still much better than powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Very few; it is initially messy to apply and it is relatively expensive compared to a well known powder for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product caused a burning sensation. I do not recommend this product. Keeping dry should not be at the expense of burning parts!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I dont mind dealing with my husbands balls after he uses fresh balls. May have saved my marriage.</li>
            <li> When I heard about this product, I had to try it because I HATE sweating down there. The name of the product is kind of embarrassing (not the sort of thing I would ever want someone to see me buying/using), but it did get my attention. The price was rather steep, but I figured if it worked, it would be well worth it.  Let&#x27;s just say the results were disappointing. The product smells pleasant enough and I will say it is better than nothing, but it sure didn&#x27;t work miracles. Everytime I go to use some, some of the liquid has solidified in the tube so it makes a mess with dried white crust breaking off the packaging, which is also rather wasteful. If this was a $3 item, I would probably keep using it as I search for something better, but at $12-15 a tube (which lasts about two months if you don&#x27;t use it too liberally), I think I&#x27;ll just try a liquid cornstarch type lotion for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I still rate it 5 stars because despite its inability to completely dry my swamp it did keep it smelling fresh.  Working on roofs in Louisiana during the Summer in long pants without sweaty balls is an impossibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product relieved much of the ball chafing and almost all of the ball stank in a way that Gold Bond has just never been able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sort of tingles when you rub it on your sack too.</li>
            <li> Just received my order today of three tubes and this was one of my best investment every. Used this for the first time today after a shower and this is the best I felt for a long time. Just makes you feel so fresh and clean down there and guess what NO WETNESS. Thank You fresh balls.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says!  Keeps you dry and fresh.  Tested it in the humidity of the Florida Keys and it help up.  Men...BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> great product wish it wouldn&#x27;t leave a trail though.</li>
            <li> for some reason it doesn&#x27;t dry, it gets creamy there and it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d like to feel down there</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used relating to, well, having fresh balls. Better than baby powder, gold bond and any other item I&#x27;ve tried. This product truly does leave you with...Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li> My balls have never felt better, If you have any balls at all you should try this product. It changed my like now I can get back to performing delicate surgery instead scratching all the time</li>
            <li> This stuff costs a lot for such a small amount, but I had to try it. So I paid and wished for the best. To my amazement, I used it and now have the freshest set of balls on the block. This stuff really works and it keeps things dry and fresh longer than any powder or lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, that&#x27;s not my thing.  I wanted to write a review for this product because it&#x27;s truly a miracle.  I work around women and I had an issue and if you purchased this product you know what that issue is.  The odor that comes with this problem is humiliating.  I would take at least 6 trips to the bathroom per day just so I could wipe with handi wipes.  Getting back to the smell, you really can&#x27;t hide it.  It&#x27;s hard to hide smells that come from bodily fluids.  I was devastated, withdrwan and I really didn&#x27;t talk to the people around me becuase I was so ashamed.  I tried this product today for the first time and THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  The smell was gone, the handi wipes are gone and my confidence is back!!!!  This things works for the full day not a few hours like other products.  I am a different person at work and I am definately more social with the girls and they even commented on how good I smell.  Take back your life and buy this product, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years to solve the problem of sweaty, clammy balls and the odor that goes with that. Until I discovered this product, I used to load on the \\&quot;after shower\\&quot; dry powder stuff and what a mess that was! It did help but this actually solves the problem. I put this on after a shower and my balls stay fresh, dry and odor-free for at least 24 hours. I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a liquid powder that is easy to apply and dries fast. It has a baby fresh scent and gives my balls a silky feel that the girls love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9 MAY 2011 I don&#x27;t know what happened but the last batch of this stuff I bought (four tubes) was way too thin and the baby fresh smell was gone. Because it&#x27;s too thin now, it takes forever to dry and without the fragrance, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. I hope the manufacturer gets this message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 21 JUNE 2011 It&#x27;s back and just in time for summer! The manufacturer replaced my four bad tubes and the new product is great again. The light fragrance is back and it&#x27;s just the right thickness. Thank you for fixing the problem. I&#x27;m a happy guy again!</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle.  Stops Schwetty Balls and Swampass!  Finally a cure for a hot chef!  Gets rid of ball stank!</li>
            <li> If your a guy you know you go through s*** like this alot, from working all day to a trip to the gym. Even just being out in a hot day it sucks. putting this on is easy, put on, let dry and good to go. smell and sweat free all day. and smells like i just threw on some cologne down there. which i guess if you got your ladies going for a day trip iam sure they&#x27;d appreciate it. lol ! def good product</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and do a lot of driving for my job (imagine the hot sun shining on your lap all day) so my balls and ass sweat a lot and smell like a sewer by the end of the day. This stuff does a good job keeping them dry and smelling good. Wish I found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Like springtime in your pants.  This stuff is great.  It goes on like an ointment and dries to a light talc, but leaves no powder residue and it&#x27;s un-noticable to your lady when she may be uh, investigating.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what it is.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I walk a lot at work, and well yeah... Once you sweat, the smell builds up.  This product stopped it, and that&#x27;s about all I was hoping for.  I</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer the Balla powder.  It feels nice, fresh, and dry going on...this stuff feels lotion-y.  Maybe it&#x27;d work alright after it dries, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the initial application by comparison.</li>
            <li> Finely I found a product that works</li>
            <li> Before using product, I had problems with my legs chafing during long stretches at work. Product goes on easily and cleanly, dries in a few seconds, and after drying it doesn&#x27;t cake or form too thick of a covering.  If the powder gets on clothes, it rinses of wipes off fairly easily, and this can occur when using your fly.  If you&#x27;re going to be drenched in sweat, this product isn&#x27;t going to miraculously make your crotch dry, but in normal situations it keeps you dry and keeps skin from sticking together and chafing.  I would recommend also purchasing flushable wet naps for removal / cleanup.</li>
            <li> Was ok.  Never got used to it going on wet and then drying.</li>
            <li> Can you say, \\&quot;Hoax\\&quot;.  The marketing department makes claims that I found inaccurate. I found that this product does not reduce scrotum sweat. Keep your money!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product, but I have to say I can tell a difference when I use it.  I am always on my feet at work eight hours a day.  Once I got the product, I tried it the very next morning before going to work.  The product sort of feels like a smooth lotion that you put on your hands when they get too dry.  At the end of the day, I was surprised that I was actually dry. So, I went the next couple of days without using it to feel the difference, and I have to say I won&#x27;t skip using this product.  It is very easy to rinse off, and I didn&#x27;t smell anything after using all day.</li>
            <li> We first learned of this product when Howie Mandell talked about it on a talk show.  My husband likes the product and says that it works to prevent the chaffing that occurs in our hot, humid summers.  It is a product staple in his grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband.  He feels the product works as advertised and is very impressed.  It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts all day, prevents chafing, keeps him dry, and has a very pleasant light scent.  He will definitely be ordering more of this product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you want the original product this is not what you will be getting. This is a Misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not the first to state this. Change it!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered one for myself and one ( the breast version) for my wife. The company made an error and shipped me two fresh balls. I contaced them and explained the situation.&lt;br /&gt;They expressed their sincer appologies and mailed me a free \\&quot;fresh breast\\&quot; right away.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that these are really good people but their product works perfect just as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first. I have always been a Gold Bond or Baby Powder on my balls kind of guy. But I heard about this product and decided to give it a try. Talcum powder in general is just messy and I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t taste good for the ladies. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week and I am pleasantly surprised. When you first apply it you get a little \\&quot;heat\\&quot; going on down there. Just a slight tingle. And throughout the day I honestly notice my balls are dry. The product may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! I was out in 85 degree heat and I was sweating every were and my balls were not all sweaty as usual!! Im going to by more.</li>
            <li> Balls are fresh all day! I have reorder soon so if u can get 3 tunes when order. One tube last around 2 months.</li>
            <li> This product works great and would recommend it to any person who needs this. I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It keeps me fresh and dry.  My girlfriend loves it when I use it.  Its super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue for me.  This stuff really comes in handy on humid days where I live and keeps my drawers from sticking or making me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Think a little overpriced. But it does help a great deal dealing with the sweaty smell at end of day. Make sure to keep tube stored upright on cap otherwise when you squeeze it out will get too much at one time.</li>
            <li> This is what I ordered, but, not what I received in the mail. The stuff I got is crap. Orange and blue tube of pure crap. I want the original in the silver tube.</li>
            <li> Makes long days in the Arizona heat not so SWAMPY!!! Thank you Fresh Balls for the dryness and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> the illustration is for the original product which I have used in the past.  The product shipped was in a different container, orange color, and I have tried it in the past.  It is not effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grey colored package was effective; the orange is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will return product.</li>
            <li> My balls are fresher than ever! Lbvs&lt;br /&gt;It really does stop the odor and the sweat!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had this product yrs ago. I&#x27;m about to get a lifetime supply. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Truth in advertising here. It works. Apply after the shower, dry all day even in high humidity summer days in the warehouse. I preach about this stuff at work. Everyone thinks it&#x27;s a joke at first but becomes a believer after the first application.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it helps prolong the amount if time you have to race to the shower after a good workout. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s akin to underarm deodorant; for your balls. I do like the cologne scent they added to it though. My only complaint is it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for the amount that you get. Either make the bottle bigger for the same price, of lower the price on the same sized bottle and ill always keep a supply. Otherwise, I save it for a hot date night. ;)</li>
            <li> I work in construction and sweat most days all day. I almost always shower at night before bed and rub a small amount on my boys before bed. Even by the end of the next work day the boys are dry and smelling good. Dries to a powder rather quickly and a very little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband found this neither efficacious nor pleasant. I enjoyed it more than he did.</li>
            <li> What can I say, my balls smell fresh, lol.  I bought it to be sort of silly and why not smell good for my GF. Not that I needed any, but have received many a compliment and it has lasted a year so far!</li>
            <li> sorry if thats TMI, but thats what we are talking about here... i was skeptical, saw this featured on a documentary, and thought to my self &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. I sit in a chair for most of my day, and some days, it gets really hot, and therefore, uncomfortable. Yes, i could use powder if I really wanted to stay dry, but powder is messy, and ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! after i get out of the shower, this has become part of my routine. I stay dry all day. its hard to try to get people to try it out... having people look at you funny when you start putting some on in the locker room...and then when you explain what it is, they are like &amp;#34;pfft, get out of here, thats weird&amp;#34;. not sure why its weird, but what ever. Try it.</li>
            <li> When you have the time this is the best product but, it is sloppy to use and a little goes a long WAY. I prefer using Balla Powder on the go and if I am taking time to get ready I will use this. It smell goods and does its job.</li>
            <li> It gives a comfortable feeling for a minute,  then nothing.  Maybe I got a bad tube.Its ok I guess.  Thats all folks.</li>
            <li> We saw this product when watching a &amp;#34;mock-umentary&amp;#34; called &amp;#34;Mansome&amp;#34;.  This product was a featured item and SO HILARIOUS!  I knew I had to find it for Christmas.  Bonus is that this is actually not a chemical laden product like I expected.  No sulfates, parabens, etc and lots of natural ingredients.  Since we are some of those green people who care about stuff like that, he might even use it!  If he does, I will be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a documentary called &amp;#34;Mansome&amp;#34; and my girlfriend actually bought it for me for Christmas in my stocking.  I absolutely love it!  It goes on like a lotion, cools, and dries into a powder.  It&#x27;s amazing, no more batwing, feels great.  Definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> My Sons were almost in tears when they looked in their stockings. No longer will they worry that they may not be &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough when looking for Ms. Right!</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s great, gotta wash your hands tho because it leaves white marks on anything you touch. ALso I had a whole tube taken from me at Heathrow because it is 5oz. I appreciate the extra amount over the 3oz tube but the 30z tube is great for travellers who don;t check bags but now MY bag doesn&#x27;t get its treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Think about having a travel size again</li>
            <li> Keeps my sac nice and dry during these hot, humid Nashville days. Hated when my nuts would always stick to the sides of my legs and get that pungent, glorious ball smell by the end of the night. Now, they smell as fresh as spring and stay as dry as the Las Vegas heat.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancé who is a mechanic and it&#x27;s been very hot and powder clumps and gets all over. We saw this product in a movie called Mansome on netflix and I figured I&#x27;d get it for my fiancé. It&#x27;s a cream that becomes a powder. Works great!!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After a knee injury I was given a straight leg brace and unable to put pressure on my leg. This also led to me being unable to take a full shower without extensive preparation. Needless to say while sitting around all day \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; got a little sweaty and after a few days a little \\&quot;stanky\\&quot;. Discussing my problem, my friend recommended fresh balls. I&#x27;ve used gold bond in the past, but, it&#x27;s a mess and clumps with any moisture. Fresh balls goes on like lotion and once dry keeps the man dangles as [...] as daisies. At this point In my recovery I&#x27;m pretty sure my wife would have divorced me (or at least would be sleeping in the guest room) without fresh balls, so thank you!</li>
            <li> Actually, it was for my pubescent son who was just discovering the joys of nads. Seems to do the trick as I don&#x27;t see him adjusting himself unceremoniously in public any more.</li>
            <li> This product works mostly good and has a very nice fresh scent. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or anything like that. It stays out of your way once it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like fresh balls</li>
            <li> Basically, what this is ia powder that is immersed in a solution the consistency of handcream. It actually does work.</li>
            <li> Tends to work pretty well but make sure you are diligent about applying it</li>
            <li> My ball are as fresh as a summers day</li>
            <li> If you can get past the name, you will love this product.  Does exactly what it says it does.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> does the job, takes a minute or two to dry, but once it does, it keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> I saw this on some daytime talksow and ordered it. To me it is an awesome product. It keeps the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; dry and prevents sweat while doing activities that cause body heat. I live in Florida and most of the time I free ball because it is keeps things dry. I added this to my daily routine and will continue to buy it. If you play sports or work outside I&#x27;d highly recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I really like and easy application. Just FYI - just use on your balls, not the shaft, just feels weird. Other than that I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li> great product for workouts.</li>
            <li> Gave them as presents for Xmas to my gym rat kids they loved the fresh balls great for workouts prevents your jock rash</li>
            <li> My husband works outside (constructionn) and he loves this product.  It keeps him dry and comfortable during the very hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I am now placing my THIRD order for Fresh Balls. A 3-pack. This stuff works SO incredibly well, and each bottle lasts a little longer than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on like a lotion, and when it dries it works like powder, except you don&#x27;t have the mess that powder leaves. I&#x27;ve been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \\&quot;powder puff\\&quot; to apply the powder under scrotum, etc. Obviously, the powder goes into the air and lands everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Fresh Balls, I dry the area very well, to start, often even using a hair blow dryer. I take about a dime size amount and rub it on the left side of my scrotum. Rub another dime size on the left side. Rub a nickel size amount underneath, and a little on the \\&quot;top\\&quot; where my penis might hang. I don&#x27;t want to put any directly on the shaft in case my wife and I get intimate later that day and it happens to go in her mouth. Finally, I put some underneath my scrotum, at the top and between my legs, where they touch together. Basically, any where I feel that sweaty feeling throughout the day. I get dressed immediately after application. The lotion dries in a few minutes (yes, at first it was uncomfortable with wetness where I wanted it dry, but as I said, it dries quickly). I am sweat free ALL DAY LONG. This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No powder mess. No need for re-application. Best of all: it works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have Goldbond powder all over the toilet seat and floor when I go to use the bathroom after my husband has just showered.  No weird smells coming from his undercarriage either.  Do your loved one a favor and buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the need to powder my undercarriage. After seeing this featured in Manscaping movie (I think) thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. Nice drying and slight menthol refreshing feeling upon application and shortly after. Leaves white powder marks in dark underwear at end of day. Prob better with boxers than briefs.</li>
            <li> When you work in the heat of summer and temperatures exceed 125 degrees, the last thing you want to be worried about is chaffing.  Apply for comfort before it gets uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does work well.  Great for hot summer days!  I think i get the same performance (maybe better) with goldbond powder, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> A good price for a good product. It does work, keeps things very dry and fresh. Wish they still sold the \\&quot;fresh balls\\&quot; tshirts.</li>
            <li> Here is my honest review: This product works very well to keep the boys dry and clean smelling under normal circumstances. Now, if I have a hard workout at the gym,mowing the grass or anything that may cause an extreme sweat I noticed very little moisture, but not much and amazingly NO musty smell! A very clean fresh feeling still existed. I can go to work for 8 hours and have a modest amount of activity(walking,crawling around under equipment,etc) and I&#x27;m truly fresh when I get home.  So in conclusion this stuff works for me and I will most surely keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Just terrible. Felts gross</li>
            <li> Dry Balls. This stuff works great. No more sweaty balls and it reduces odor as well after intense workouts and runs.</li>
            <li> Helps out with perspiration in between the legs...  A must have when playing sports in warmer climates!</li>
            <li> Hey, much to my surprise this product does exactly what it claims. It goes on like a lotion, then dries to what can only be describes as a fine dry powder; and it last all day long!</li>
            <li> I received a 3oz container, not 5oz as advertised. It is clearly the old packaging, not the new design that is shown in the image.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and ended up using it more than him, rather than buying my own tube of the Fresh Boobs or whatever it&#x27;s called. This stuff is the bomb. Works anywhere. Summertime savior!</li>
            <li> You have to try it to believe it. Totally worth it. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to everyone I work with. I work construction and am outside all day. Such an improvement I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I bought a black car with leather seats. I sit in my car 8-10 hours a day. Then I thought I would buy leather couches. You may see the problem that developed. It works. Not 100% but pretty close to it. You will have confidence again. I spread it on my waistline too. Wherever you get a little damp. The first time I heard the commercial on Stern I thought it was a joke commercial. It&#x27;s not this is legit. My only other suggestion is you may want more than one bottle to start with.</li>
            <li> I never knew about such a product until reading about it in one of those men magazines but after reading about it; I thought why not give it a try. Well after using it for a few days, one can really appreciate a since of freedom. I no longer experience the sticky and sweaty sensation of a rigorous day. Fresh all day.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004BC62MI Fresh Balls The Solution For Men - 3 oz]]This product has helped return the fun to summer. Guaranteed to be a return customer.</li>
            <li> The product goes on slippery like a lotion and once you start sweating it has a greasy feeling.  I thought that it would go on like a lotion, but later dry and keep me dry the rest of the day.  I was wrong.  I felt just as swampy as ever and had to discontinue to use the product after 3 days.  I reverted back to Gold Bond powder in the green packaging. I wanted something easier to apply than a powder, but in my opinion the Gold Bond is much more effective.  It might be one of things like deodorant, whereas some deodorants work well for some people and not for others.  Fresh Balls didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this product with high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It irritated my skin and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Wow, dri Balls for sure. No more wet crotch that gets irritated.</li>
            <li> Everyone should use this! Best invention for gentlemen&#x27;s grooming since the electric razor! Exceeded my expectations by bounds. Remarkable product!</li>
            <li> i didnt like the smell of it and it didnt cover the sweat or the smell after a workout was a waste of money it all hype if it at least smell good i could have gave it 2 stars but it sucks</li>
            <li> This crap gave me a rash I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I must say it is just what it says it is great it keeps my balls dry and pretty much inch free most the most part.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what you want it to do.  Goes on like a moisturizer but dries quickly into a powder.  Also makes it so it doesn&#x27;t look like you had a cocaine party in your pants.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I run or bike for a few miles. It keeps me dry and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a swampland down there. Plus your laundry doesn&#x27;t smell so bad which is a big plus if your wife or girlfriend does your laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies like a cream or lotion but quickly dries into a powder, so that makes it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a documentary Mansome and thought I would give it a try. Keeps my man bits dry all day and fresh. Working retail I&#x27;m walking around a lot and sometimes the building just gets hot and I sweat in places that I don&#x27;t want. This product does what it says! Just bought another bottle! Wish it was sold in a bigger quantity other then 3oz but what ever.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this stuff when I first read about it in a men&#x27;s magazine but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I often use powder to keep fresh and this was a nice alternative.  Make sure you wash your hands after application though... because once it dries it become powdery and can leave white residue on whatever you touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a talc guy for years, with a tour in Afghanistan talc always did the trick. Recently one of my buddies was talking about this stuff saying how great it is and his balls stay dry all the time. After a few weeks I decided to give it a try, I received my tube a few days ago and to tell you the truth, I don&#x27;t notice a difference. There is no scent on the liquid and even with a fresh up during the day, my balls are still sweaty. I don&#x27;t abnormally sweat, and I did notice a slight difference at first, but it is not really working the way it is described. Maybe I received a bad batch of it? I did smell my buds tube and his definitely has a stronger scent than mine does, and isn&#x27;t as liquidy as mine, so I am assuming it is. I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> So, basically, I heard about this in a documentary once, time went by and then I suddenly saw it here on Amazon. I totally remembered the name of course, since it does have quite a fun name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought to myself &amp;#34;They made it, let´s see if it works&amp;#34;. Surprised to say, it sure does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don´t have a terrible problem with sweaty cojones, but let´s just say that my boxers have a tendency to be very clingy and we all know how it feels like when balls (I can say it since the product says it) and boxers want to cuddle, it´s not the most pleasant feeling ever, neither is it always the right place and time to start digging to separate the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I decided to give it a try, and to my surprise this is a really helpful little solution. Not only does it keep me very dry and smooth down south, it also got rid of the other problem I described in a little too much detail further up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has that weird smell of lotion though, but luckily not too strong. I´m just saying, IF you get lucky one day and someone is to be down there for whatever reason, I have a feeling the taste would be a bit off-putting. Juuuust saying..</li>
            <li> Just after a few days ... Fresh makes a HUGE improvement ... smells great ! works great ! i&#x27;ve tried every product on market .. none worked .. hopefull for long term solution ..</li>
            <li> Nothing keeps the boys as fresh as Fresh Balls! Easy apply,lasts,my woman appreciates the non man smell,oh yeah! Get it</li>
            <li> Awesome product...definitely helps you stay dry. All my guy friends and brothers are getting this for Xmas</li>
            <li> An amazing purchase. We&#x27;re super happy with this.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy out of the container, and it leaves a chalky residue on his &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; Otherwise thr product works as it was described.</li>
            <li> fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy fast what i want very happy..</li>
            <li> My balls are always sweaty and when I&#x27;d go pee the scent would hit my face of sweaty balls. wasn&#x27;t bad just not pleasant because you don&#x27;t want your balls to smell like anything. tingles when you put it on but does a nice job at removing smells.</li>
            <li> My two sons actually use this product and say it really works.  I appreciate the straight-up name of it--there&#x27;s no mistaking what it&#x27;s for.  It does leave white residue, even though the company claims it doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s from your HANDS from when you apply it.  Use a little care and there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to try. He commented that he really likes it, that it, &amp;#34;keeps him from sticking.&amp;#34; I like that it keeps him from &amp;#34;smelling&amp;#34; after a hot day ;)</li>
            <li> I road my bike over 50 miles  on a bike tour of upper bucks county Pa.,  I usually get a rash in the groin area, due to sweet and heat not today. today I was dry as a bone with no rash. Fresh Balls works great.  Steve Russell</li>
            <li> Works great, better than I expected. Goes on smooth, dries quickly and works all day. Recommend to others who sweat when they work out.</li>
            <li> Dont you think im so sexy? im just so fresh and clean..so fresh and so clean clean. aint no body dope as me me, im just so fresh and clean...so fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li> I am a serious sweater.  I was a Gold Bond user for years until I found this product.  It lasts longer than powder, and there&#x27;s no mess.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail quickly and it works just the way it says it does. I really like this product. Good buy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff - he&#x27;s not fearing the heat of the summer anymore! After using FB he is noticeably fresher hours later.</li>
            <li> If a snake oil sales man were selling liquified ball powders this&#x27;d be it.  It goes on as advertised, thats all I&#x27;m prepared to say.</li>
            <li> $10 for a small jar is a bit expensive, I could buy a few bottles of baby powder for the same price and it would last longer.  Did an ok job, but for the price I think ill stick with baby powder.  Its not as powdery as I expected and didn&#x27;t seem to reduce moisture at all.  It did leave that area smelling nice and feeling soft though.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product and it worked ok when I tried it out. I really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave powder all over clothes or the floor. Maybe this is just unique to me, but in my experience the dry effect would wear off within 3-4 hours if that and I don&#x27;t live in too hot of an area! I experimented with varying amounts and gave it ample time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product weren&#x27;t so expensive for such a small tube I would be willing to try another, but for me I will stick to body powder because its about 10x cheaper even though it doesn&#x27;t last as long. After reading all of the other positive reviews I may just be the odd one out but this is my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be embarassed; we all get a little humid near the equator. If you want to keep your swamp dry and feeling fresh, get this. This has not only drastically changed any of the moisture-related issues I had (chafing, ingrown hair, etc.) but also makes the entire region feel cleaner and cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just for the above, though; if you are headed out for a night with the partner of your choice, this can make the difference between impersonal and personal attention to that part of the body, if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona. It gets hot and sweaty around these (and those) parts. There is nothing worse then peeling your ball sack off your inner thigh. (I can go commando all day with this shaz on my nards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hark, what is that over yonder? It is I my fellow man friends, Fresh Balls to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this stuff to your scrotal section, and rejoice in the cool dryness bestowed on your balls by this ingenious product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, it keeps me happy, keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Great for summer or putting on before work. Really does keep the ole boys fresh and clean. My ladies love it.</li>
            <li> It will get the job done, but if you use it on a daily basis it will run out soon.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product on Howard Stern show!Had to try it!I used to just use deoderent, but this stuff  works awesome!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, goes on wet but ends up like a powder!? Really helps with chaffing and keeps that area nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It&#x27;s true that it &amp;#34;balls up&amp;#34; less than talcum powder and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to give this product a try. It works great for me, keeping me feeling dry and fresh all day no matter the work conditions. It&#x27;s not messy and does not take much to get the job done. Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is the small amounts wasted every day when I open the cap. Any small excess that leaves the bottle will harden and crumbles off as dust.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh feeling all day</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for Howie Mandel, it&#x27;s good enough for me..  Best product for your jewels EVER!  Fresh Balls does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time on a mountain bike in the Texas heat, and was looking for something to prevent chafing. Oddly enough, I saw Howie Mandel pitching the virtues of Fresh Balls on Jay Leno&#x27;s show one night, and was intrigued. After discovering that it wasn&#x27;t available locally, I ordered it from an Amazon Merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did the trick. It&#x27;s much easier to apply than powder, and does seem to keep things cool and dry. Nice product. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product lasts all day.  Feels liquidity going on and for the first 15 minutes after application  but then starts to become smooth and silky. My boys feel great. The only con is the instructions state you only need a dime size worth but you have to put a little more then a quarter of the product before you get your unit fully covered.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first, but over time developed a bad rash.  My buddy had the same problem.  It&#x27;s a great idea, and it may work well for some guys.  But be careful that you aren&#x27;t one of us that can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I sweat and don&#x27;t like sweaty balls. This goes on like a lotion, but has a powder element that keeps the boys soft, dry, and touchable. Yes, it sounds like a gag gift, but it really works. Got to have a sense of humor here.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when working out or playing sports things get a little chafed up in the manly region.  I used to use gold bond but that cakes up and smells funny and it causes some problems for the ladies.  With FB there is little to no smell and your package is kept bone dry for well over a day.  I have recommend this product to 4 other friends in the past month and they all love it.  I will look into picking up their other products should I want to continue the ongoing battle of sweaty man parts.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works pretty well.  I&#x27;m not going to buy it again since it&#x27;s so  expensive.&lt;br /&gt;oh well</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER USED FOR MY...ER...AREA. KEEPS YOU FRESH AND DRY FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I was made aware of this for men that helps us stay fresh. Fresh Balls is a lotion that turns into a freshness product, well… let me let them explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEM:&lt;br /&gt;99.9 % OF ALL MEN SUFFER FROM THE PROBLEM OF SWEATY BALLS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;br /&gt;FreshBalls was created to take care of the problems the other companies forgot about. Here at freshballs we take pride in using natural products that not only solve the problem, but they are good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there in a nutshell you have the problem and solution. Does it work? Should you get some? YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately ordered Fresh Balls from Amazon.com (it is Prime Eligible BTW) and two days later I was in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to their claim it keeps things fresh. The lotion has a pleasant smell (not girly) and feels soft. Once the lotion drys, things stay fresh. Real fresh. Depending on what you do during your day you may need to freshen up, but Fresh Balls certainly makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go get some Fresh Balls today!</li>
            <li> Although it is nice to not use messy powders for ones body, FB does not work nearly as good as most powders. I loved this idea and I wanted it to be the godsend the hype made it out to be but, it just isn&#x27;t. About 13$ for a tiny tube it too much for uses that you get for it (I bought my first tube 10 days ago). You have to use quite a bit of it for it to be moderately effective, and reapplication on the fly is pretty much impossible. It doesn&#x27;t keep me very dry and its only January. Maybe if it was sold in MUCH less expensive jumbo tubes. For now, back to good ol&#x27; cornstarch.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping things dry. Smells nice too. It would be nice if it lasted longer. Usually get about 5-6 hours out of it without any exercise before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really humid where I live (at least during the summer). I also work out a lot. This stuff is unbelievable. No sticky, no odor, nothing but dry freshness and an awesome feeling down there. There&#x27;s not much like it.</li>
            <li> The new formula is not good, it dose not keep it dry down there.  You are better to do without.  The old formula worked, the new formula leaves you wet and sticky and not in a good way.  I through it in the trash after several attempts to like it.</li>
            <li> ***SHAKE THE BOTTLE BEFORE YOU USE IT***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review title pretty much says it all. This is a very interesting product.  When you first try it, your thoughts are \\&quot;Hmm...seems to work...smells fresh...no more powder all over the place...I guess it&#x27;s ok.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use it for a few weeks. It works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, you realize there simply is no going back to traditional talcum powder/gold bond/etc.  It&#x27;s a great product that functions as well as (if not better than) the more traditional alternatives.  I just ordered the six pack and will be ordering another when I get low.  Interested to see how it performs in the legendary Arizona heat this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot and leave your review!</li>
            <li> works great, lasts a long time during those hot n sweaty moments, keeps you feeling just like it says, fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> As expected, this is exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for  this item</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work, but it does leave residue in your clothing, not to mention a big mess on hands after application.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just becasue I was curious what exactly it does! I&#x27;ve tried them several times and I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping me feeling differently! or more energetic! as they advertise it</li>
            <li> ...if you use &amp;#34;Balls&amp;#34;, you know it is effective, but may get a little stingy - this stuff works great to make things nice again.</li>
            <li> a friend got some as a gift.  i tried it and was instantly hooked.  get 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and be cautious, you will use this product for rest of your life.</li>
            <li> I had often found my balls sweating after a long days work. Now, I start my day with a fresh shower, and a fresh scrotum thanks to the Fresh Balls solution. When you first apply it, it gives a nice chilling sense, and clean aroma. After applying there is little mess as the residue left in my hand is negligible, and easily wiped away. I have never used any other products, so I do not have much to compare, and will admit to buying due to the name, but I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead. Freshen up.</li>
            <li> Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps your scrotum dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Period.</li>
            <li> Little caking when applied</li>
            <li> This product did not keep dry as advertised.  However I was golfing in 105 plus degree heat.  Have not tried it when temp was under 100</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I sweat a lot in the hot weather and this seemed like something I would really appreciate.  I was wrong.  It did nothing it was supposed to and was a complete waste of money; however, the purchase and receipt of the product went without a hitch and got to me quickly and without problem...maybe because no one else wants it as they knew how it would work???</li>
            <li> For years I have suffered (and I mean SUFFERED) with my sack sticking to my legs. Summer, winter, hot weather or cold it happens and nothing would give me more than a few minutes relief. No powder, no lotion, nor even using a hair dryer &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; after showering helped.  Then I heard and read reviews about &amp;#34;Fresh Balls&amp;#34;. In spite of the high price I tried it and I am thrilled to say my decades-long agony is over.&lt;br /&gt;After my morning shower I coat my sack with this fantastic product. It begins as a lotion then dries and forms a powder and stops the sticky problem all day and in any weather condition. I give the boys another coating at before bed and have no sticking all night. This is now my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar problem and have not found a solution, try this product. It works for me and I am sold on it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic alternative that lasts much longer than powders and doesn&#x27;t leave you with glue if you do get too sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the reviewers here pointing out two \\&quot;problems\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves a white powder residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions, and _wash your hands after applying_, there is no residue beyond a lighter look to your nether regions. I&#x27;m not talking about looking like a mime either, but it&#x27;s not nearly as obvious as being splattered in gold bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t keep you dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, so if you are sweating profusely then yes eventually it will stop working. Goldbond et al would only leave me dry for a few hours typically, but with this I am good to go all day unless I go to the gym or walk a few miles in the summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth a try -- just make sure you read the instructions and you&#x27;ll more than likely be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago now and I love it. A little goes a long way and my bathroom isn&#x27;t covered in dust after I use it. I would recommend this any guy, whether you are active or just sitting on the couch, for an always fresh and dry feeling. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> got this on a friends recommendation and I am very pleased with the way it works, totally kills the swamp problem I get while working outside at my job. follow the directions just as described and honestly you don&#x27;t need to re-apply for at least 8-10 hours. This product needs to be out in public more.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it on days when hiking or cycling. It helps reduce the moisture/sweat that a guy has during aerobic exercise. The only drawback is when making a \\&quot;pit stop.\\&quot; You need to check your fly for signs of the talc powder residue when finished. The product description informs you to wash your hands after applying. Definitely scrub your hands well (maybe even twice) or your next meal will taste a bit chalky, because the lotion will absorb into your hands and leave them talc covered!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAD THE PROBLEM WITH SWEATING DOWN THERE BUT I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AFTER SEE REVIEWS AND THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT IT WORKS YOU WILL NOT WASTE OUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT I&#x60;M GLAD I DID AND SO NOW THEY HAVE A REPEATING CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  Quells the shweat and shtank that can result from a moist Fromunda Zone.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody looking to keep their &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; fresh and dry. Works as described! I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 because, while it worked well, it does not work as well as talc powder. This product does not have the same negative side effects of continuing to use talc powder (dry and itchy skin). This also does not have the smell of baby powder! I will definitely continue using this product and my wife is very grateful!</li>
            <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;does what it says&lt;br /&gt;but over priced&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again&lt;br /&gt;good , but not that good</li>
            <li> I have used Fresh Balls for a while now and they only con about it is the powder left on your hand after applying it. It keeps &#x27;everything&#x27; dry even during ranges or out on patrol in Afghanistan. I definitely recommend Fresh Balls to any guy looking to keep cool and dry.</li>
            <li> FLABBY LOOSE TO FIRM AND TIGHT ;-)  I think that is the best way to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;*:·SUPER .·:*¨¨*:·.HAPPY CUSTOMER*¨¨*:··:FAST SHIPPING*¨¨*A+++LOVE IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this and thought it&#x27;d be a great gag gift for my husband, but found very promising reviews.  My husband is a guitar player and always complains about how much he sweats while jumping around on stage.  He&#x27;s tried almost every product out there to keep his boys fresh and dry, with much disappointment.  Let me just explain how well this stuff works in one sentence: after a 5-hour long show, we were both very satisfied with its results when he let me &amp;#34;relieve his tension.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I read the good review in Mens health magazine. I have used baby powder to stay dry, and to stop chaffing which works really good. I hated the cloud of talc that came with applying it though. I have used fresh balls for a few weeks, and am extremely disappointed. It does nothing to help me stay dry compared to baby powder. Save your money and go to walmart for baby powder.</li>
            <li> When first applied there is a slight tingling sensation; that took getting used to.  It dries quickly.  Nice light fragrance. Seems to last all day, even on warm days.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this product.  It makes him much more&lt;br /&gt;comfortable than before. Why do I have to write a certain&lt;br /&gt;number of words?  the product is great</li>
            <li> stuff doesnt last very long after it dries, burns like heck on yer &amp;#34;dangly bits&amp;#34;. After two days use, my boys were still as moist as a used sponge, were red and agitated, and hurt. DO NOT BUY! Use simple baby powder and you&#x27;ll be much happier</li>
            <li> If your reading this, then you know what it&#x27;s for. All i can tell you is that I tried it and it works!</li>
            <li> Being a stickler for grooming and hygiene, I bought a tube for a wedding I was attending. Not reading the instructions, I used an entire tube. What a mistake. Little did I know that I left a white trail of dried powder falling through my trousers wherever I went that entire day. I only found this out during the reception, when couples kept falling on the dance floor, thanks to my slippery trail of dried product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is made of the identical ingredients of My Fresh Breasts. This does not seem scientifically sound...</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this product, my husband had to keep a catch-can between his legs to catch his duck-butter from wetting his jeans.  Fast forward to the first several uses: his balls feel like they are kept in a laboratory desiccator!  Goes on silky smooth, dries to mess free powdered finish!  Y&#x27;all better buy stock in Fresh Balls, because my husband swears by this product!</li>
            <li> If you are tired of dealing with excess powder on the floor and the cloud that follows you, this is the product for you.  No product is going to be perfect for everyone, but I found that Fresh Balls did the trick for me.  I spend a lot of time outside for work and this product lived up to my expectations.  Fresh Balls kept me as dry if not more so than any other product I have used previously.  I will definitely be purchasing this product from Amazon again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;  As an aside, I did not experience the burning sensation or greasy residue other reviews complained about.  I found the best way to use the product is to apply, let it dry then get dressed.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone, like me, who has to be outside walking around for many hours at a time. It keeps you dry and fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Fresh balls come in a small tube  and you need to apply it liberally. It feels wired but it does work for a little while however ,I did notice it doesn&#x27;t work as well regular baby powder . Although it did not have a strong scent I feel it should have.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after I got sick of the messiness of using talc powders to keep my boys dry. The product is of high quality and applies like lotion. I cannot say really if it better than the talc at absorption, but the product does work as described. Just be sure to wash your hands after applying or you&#x27;ll get ghost hands.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say about this: it works. I&#x27;m buying more as soon as this one gets low (which looks like it&#x27;ll last a while, it doesn&#x27;t take much more than a pea-sized amount)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only word of caution: dry off before applying LOL, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get what feels like white lint on your scrotum. But if you&#x27;re dry, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting on a soothing invisible layer of magical angel whispers. haha. The smell may seem a little strange at first, but let me be blunt: it&#x27;s better than the normal smell, trust me. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product, glad it exists, customer for life.</li>
            <li> After a long day, every guy produces wetness in his groin area.  This product eliminates that wetness, HOWEVER, only use a little!  I found that if you use too much, it drys up your skin and causes an itch all day long.  Also, be careful not to get it directly on your penis, as it will leave a white unattractive residue.  This product really does work - it seems a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.  And for personal hygiene, is their really a thing as spending too much?  Come on guys, we all need this product.</li>
            <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Dries quickly and washes away easily. If you use a bit much it may leave a powdery residue in your underwear but that washes out easily enough.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I&#x27;m about to order more! Does exactly what it says. Keeps you balls dry. I work 24 hour shifts in Texas and I cant recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> It works GREAT. I am a Marine, in Yuma, AZ and it kept my balls fresh. Make sure you use more than just a very thin layer, and it works awesome. The only downside is that at the end of the day, I had a bit of dust on my socks as the day&#x27;s movement had removed some of the product and it shifted down my legs (beware if you wear boxers!). All that means is that I cannot use this product as I wish when Im wearing my service uniforms but when wearing cammies, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> As promised this product helps keep your crotch dry and sweet.  Easy to use and has a pleasant odor.  Certainly not a necessary product in one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> It just works.. no irritation and best thing is wife doesn&#x27;t complain that I smell like well you know at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I always have a problem with still sweating after I get out of the shower. i would dry off with a towel, put clean clothes on, and then I would start sweating again, making it miserable to go out on a date or wherever. But when I apply this stuff to you know where, I stay dry....</li>
            <li> It does work, butI don&#x27;t care for the powdery residue it forms after it dries....makes a mess of your underwear.</li>
            <li> Okay, so my intent is not to be gross but simply to illustrate how much I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my confession: I had stinky balls. By the end of the day, they are almost unbearable. This issue made me feel self-conscious and as a result, I didn&#x27;t want to engage in play time with my wife because I didn&#x27;t want to gross her out. I would usually wait until after a shower to be intimate and those aren&#x27;t always the most convenient times. I could smell myself and recognize that I was stinky so certainly my wife would be able to. I could even smell them throughout the day. I wear a suit to work so I can perspire a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Fresh Balls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical that a simple lotion could make a huge impact on this issue. I read the reviews and decided to give it a go. When it arrived, I applied it after drying myself right out of the shower. I let it dry (about two minutes) and put my clothes on. Fast forward to that evening. I was anxious to know if it worked. I sniffed, sniffed again and I couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I decided to ask my patient wife to give it a whirl. She got down on her knees and pants down took a deep sniff of the area... (I know, I know). She was amazed. She said there was only a small hint of odor. I concluded that it was because I had a #2 a little earlier. To remedy that issue I ordered Mangroomer Biz Wipes. WOW! With these two working together, I am good to go anytime any place. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you are anything like me or even have a little odor issue, get the Fresh Balls and Biz Wipes and you&#x27;ll never have odor issues again.</li>
            <li> Man are my balls fresh. Great product. Normally at work my balls get very sweaty and uncomfortable. And the smell could kill a donkey. Not anymore... Thanks fresh balls!</li>
            <li> Saw it in a men&#x27;s magazine and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I don&#x27;t need this type of product often, but when I do....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than powder!  It goes on like a lotion, so is easy to apply without any mess.  &amp;#34;Dries&amp;#34; in the amount of time it takes to put the tube away and start getting dressed.  Keeps working until washed off in a shower.  I&#x27;ve even used it in a pinch when I forgot to pack my anti-perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a staple in my Dopp bag.</li>
            <li> Leaves me slightly dryer than nothing but not as good as powder. It does leave a wierd residue but its no more unsightly or unusual than having powder all over. I think it would be better to keep and use after the gym to tide me over until I can get home but not for all day dryness.</li>
            <li> My compliment to the vendor for a speedy delivery.  Tried the product the first day I received it.  Once you apply, it has a creamy white texture and you feel a warm sensation.  After a few minutes, the solution dries up and converts to a white powdery substance.  Be sure to wash your hands as soon as you apply the solution.  If you get it on your clothes, you will see the white powder clinging on your clothes.  I really didn&#x27;t notice any odd odor emitting from the solution, but there is a slight smell.  Next month I&#x27;m meeting a woman who I met on a dating site and we already plan to have some great stories to remember.  So I&#x27;ll update this review if anything unusual is mentioned about the Fresh Balls...Later</li>
            <li> Bought this product after I saw a write up in Mens Health rating it as the best product for keeping your crotch dry and comfortable.  I would just like to confirm the Mens Health assessment.</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Crisp Balls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a young doctor (MD) that recently moved to Hawaii.  My friend let me try a dab of his Fresh Balls one night before hitting the night clubs.  I admit, I was a bit skeptical.  I&#x27;ve been saying for years that a person could be a millionaire if they invent such a product.  I&#x27;ve been using regular arm deodorant on my scrotum and perineal area for the last few months since moving to Hawaii.  I love the weather here, but a tropical climate can wreak havic on your manhood.  At times, it feels like my testicles are sitting in a sauna or cigar humidor.  After using this product, I hit the clubs with a bit more confidence.  Yes, you will sweat and have insensible fluid losses, but I promise they will not be from your testicles.  I love the soft residue it leaves behind, a subtle reminder of how Fresh your balls are indeed.  I must say, I am a taken man and I no longer have that fear or embarrassment to have my girlfriend go down on me, even after a hard rigorous work out.  Thank you Fresh Balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say this product is Doctor approved!</li>
            <li> My only complaint (something that really can&#x27;t be avoided when using a product like this) is that once the lotion turns to powder, you&#x27;ll find a bit of white dust in your boxers haha, not a huge deal, but it might look at little funny if you&#x27;re trying to stay fresh for someone and then your package has \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Keeps my balls from chaffing and the best product to get in the summer.</li>
            <li> Not as good as powder for me but its a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  How well this works as I bought for.  A gag gift! :) it got a lot of laughs so was happy with the gag gift purchase.. And hope who I bought for had great results!</li>
            <li> Fresh balls does work, but is a much more expensive solution. Obviously someone had a stroke of genius when coming up with the name. I am sure they have sold a lot of product as a joke gift because of the name. I originally heard about it on the radio as part of a joke. That being said, it should cost about $4 for 3 OZ and not $11. In addition to that, add shipping of $6 dollars for a total of $17 a tube and that is no joke. As far as the performance goes, I can&#x27;t say if it reduces odor or not, but it does not perform any better than baby power for moisture control. I suspect that it is made of talcum power in a wet mixture because it dries like baby power.</li>
            <li> So fresh and so dry is good stuff keeps you fresh all day&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stuff to every guy out there</li>
            <li> Thanks I luv my purchase it is great, just what I wanted.  You sale was everything I hoped for &amp; more.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry thus far.  I havent tried it in the summer yet, that will be the real test.  Nothing worse than batwings!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this stuff for a bit, I went back to powder.  Freshballs just doesnt last nearly as long as powder, oh well :-(</li>
            <li> Bat-wings be gone! I&#x27;ve got the freshest, driest balls in town. No more awkward walking or standing for this guy!</li>
            <li> Did a bit of research on a reliable way to shaving the boys down there without using clippers or doing a wet shave when I came across the Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro but quickly realized the musky smell the testes give off when working or working out(heck it does that even when they aren&#x27;t shaved. lol)So I came across this product and tried it out.  This stuff is very nice.  Very nice and gentle aroma too.  Applies on as a lotion and then it dries to a powder, like a light &#x27;dusting&#x27;.  And it certainly lasted all day long whic is a plus!  I don&#x27;t know how light or heavy the powder is when it coats pubic hair but that is the way it looked on my shaved groin.  Stupid name though!  I think they should have gave it a more respectable name seeing as though guys like me have a wife and 2 daughters.  Instead of me just storing it in the place where all of my manly products are stored, in full view of my family, I have to hide it so that my daughters will not see it.  I understand the laugh and all, and it is funny as hell, but I think a lot more consideration and an awareness should&#x27;ve been taken considering.  You think these folks would&#x27;ve loved to been on Oprah or Dr. Phil to advertise this product?  But because of the name they gave it could potentially turn networks and consumers off or rubbed some the wrong way.  Nonetheless, this is an awesome product and I&#x27;m very very very pleased and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this as something funny for my husbands stocking. He seriously talks about how awesome it is all the time. So I guess it&#x27;s a useful gag gift?</li>
            <li> So fresh, you&#x27;ll want one at home and in the gym bag. Your life may or may not improve otherwise, but your inner swamp thing will definitely be contained.</li>
            <li> Like my balls were on fire.  I guess they are trying to evaporate the water/sweat off your balls.  Tried it several times, in the morning after a night shower.  Right after a shower.  Right before exercise.  Same effect.  Instantaneous fire!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after a trip to southeast asia, I used it due to the humidity and my tendency to sweat profusely.  After I used the product on my balls several times, the burning sensation went away with subsequent applications.  It does work, and keeps my guys nice and dry.</li>
            <li> Fresh balls works well. It is easy to apply, dries quickly and smells great. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on you or your clothes, just make sure to apply it while you are DRY. Don&#x27;t apply it immediately after a shower, wait a few min to dry off. The only negative thing about the product is the price of it. It costs way too much for the amount given. I guess you are paying for the name. The product is similar to other liquid talc/liquid baby powder products, except w/o the name. It does smell better then those, but I don&#x27;t believe that is worth paying that much extra for. I would suggest searching for other liquid talc products if you want something that does its job just fine in this area.</li>
            <li> My husbands balls still smell and are sweaty. BUT the don&#x27;t get stuck to his thighs anymore.</li>
            <li> As advertised. No bat wings. Keeps you fresh with no discomfort. Not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after we saw it on the Morgan Spurlock documentary, Mansome.  He hasn&#x27;t said if he&#x27;s used it yet but it&#x27;s a great conversation piece if you leave it setting out on the bathroom counter during a party!</li>
            <li> So I thought it would be weird to &amp;#34;lotion up&amp;#34; down there - and it is - but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  I survived 4 days in the blistering heat and long walks of Bonnaroo in relative comfort and Fresh Balls is owed a large amount of credit for that.</li>
            <li> Works great. Keeps the fellas dry through out the day. I would  recommend this to all that have hanging fellas</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Worked in the heat with ridiculous humidity, parties with vigorous dancing and even some light workouts. Get it... your balls will be siked!</li>
            <li> Functions well and easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the next greatest thing in hygeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was Dissapointed, first the product is super runny when it comes out of the tube, so it&#x27;s hard to control where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly after about a month it started to smell really bad to the point where it was not suitable for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick to my power for freshness.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No powdered sugar coating, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stings a bit when going on, doesn&#x27;t work as well as a good powder (e.g. Balla)&lt;br /&gt;DEAL BREAKER: Smells awful. To put it into words, like grandma&#x27;s perfume bottle that has been sitting on the shelf putrefying for 2 decades. Not a smell I want going on down there. Also, the smell is really strong so it stays on your hands for hours, even after washing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little expensive but it does work.  i didn&#x27;t have a smell problem but a sticking to the leg problem.  really nice not having to adjust them all day long.!</li>
            <li> Hey it works! What more do you have to say. Only draw back, it turns clothes white just like deoderant</li>
            <li> I use this for chafing and it works great.  Great product, great idea, great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Anti-Monkey-Butt for over  a year and after a military friend who spent some time in Afghanistan traveled to Las Vegas with me...only then did I realize the awesomeness of Fresh balls.  I used to use Monkey Butt all the time but my friend said that he would &amp;#34;allow&amp;#34; me to use his fresh balls.  he said use a little dab..but i used more than usual.  While it does leave a white powdery mess on your undergarments...it does prevent chaffing.  I have ordered twice and will continue to order.  While expensive....it is cheaper than Monkey Butt.  And this product does work.  I would only suggest washing your hands after applying cause it turns everything it touches a powdery white.....and will get on your clothes!!  Other than that...its awesome.  I live in Orlando Florida and it&#x27;s hot as hell here...I even used it while in Las Vegas...and no chaffing...works great..worth the money!!  Dont be cheap and buy Johnsons &amp; Johnsons powder...will not do the same...trust me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cjros</li>
            <li> It may work for mild wetting but when you have to work long hours involving many physical labor then I do not believe this&lt;br /&gt;one is a great choice</li>
            <li> This just flat out didn&#x27;t work. Shower to Shower powder with talc works longer/better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the other issue is the application. Its is just uncomfortable to apply a liquid there after showering and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s job in that it keeps your actual balls dry for a little while. I spread the cream liberally on my balls and the entire surrounding area. While my balls remained dry the crease between my balls and my leg was moist with sweat before long. In my experience that&#x27;s where most of the odor comes from to begin with. Let&#x27;s get to my least favorite part about this product, it&#x27;s leaves a very obvious white residue once it dries. This won&#x27;t be a problem if you&#x27;re going home to your cat but any potential lady friends will suspect you have a skin condition which might ruin your evening.</li>
            <li> The product is overrated and it leaves residue everywhere. I thought it would transform to a powder but instead its just chalk everywhere.. Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle (you have to peel off a tiny seal) a large amount spurted out of the opening.&lt;br /&gt;Next use, I shook the bottle as recommended before application.&lt;br /&gt;At first there seemed to be no effect but after a short while things kicked in and I could feel the confortable dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Things stay dry pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it were available at the drug store with out the heavy shipping penalty.&lt;br /&gt;Again those local distributors drive us to the net for our purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have made a second purchase and the new containers were a bit larger!&lt;br /&gt;Now 5 ounces instead of the former 3 ounce size.&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered that if you unscrew and remove the cap (instead of flipping it up) and dispense it directly from the plastic \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; without the cap on, you don&#x27;t end up with a crusty mess on the container or&lt;br /&gt;powdery flakes on your floor.&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that while it definitely helps to keep things drier, if you do heavy activity, you well get sweaty down there but maybe somewhat less&lt;br /&gt;so then you would without it.&lt;br /&gt;Still overall worth the extra cost for the benefits. (at least now you get more for your money.)&lt;br /&gt;To save on shipping, (make it free) I used the code provided on the Howard Stern Show (100)&lt;br /&gt;PS the new container is a garish orange (think Tide box) and medium blue which seems even less attractive graphically then the old design.&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty good, but the packaging graphics are pretty tacky.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I work in a prison and it gets hot during the summer and with lots of walking around well, you get the idea. Before I go to work I just apply a little fresh balls and it lasts 16 hours if I work a double shift. Goes on like a lotion and dries pretty fast to a powder. Doesn&#x27;t clump, smells decent, you don&#x27;t notice its there except you don&#x27;t chaf like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Lately, noticed discomfort with walking and climbing stairs. This product worked so well for me. Following the first administration, within minutes my crotch was feeling so comfortable again. Underwear and blue jeans did not rub and the crease between my legs and body was calm. Great product, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this product sooner. Keeps my guys dry and fresh. Easy to apply. No complaints here and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> So my gal got this for me as a gag gift after we saw a documentary where fresh balls was apart of it. I figured since i had it, i might as well give it a try. WOW! love this stuff. No more fidgeting or scratching in public or at work. Keeps em&#x27; feeling like i just got outta the shower for pretty much the whole day. one tube lasts me months too!</li>
            <li> I am big; overweight, trying to workout. This product allows me to sweat and not need a shower just to relax after the workout session is over.</li>
            <li> It make work temporarily but there are side effects. I have used the product for about a year. During that year I had to stop using the product because it caused severe burning. I was not 100% sure if the product was causing the burning.. It was. The last time I used it, it caused a severe split in between my legs that looked like someone took a razor and cut me on both sides. I at first thought it was a great product. I just recently went to a fertility clinic because my wife and I had problems having a child. Mind you I have had children recently within the past two years. When I got back the results I was surprised to know that they my sperm was only 5% normal and there was a motility problem. Please do not use this product.</li>
            <li> Got this kinda as a joke and he said its the best! Underground miner and his balls stay so fresh for 12 hours!</li>
            <li> I sometimes work in hot and miserable conditions, and when I get home I can barely stand the stench. This stuff works like a charm. So fresh, so dry.</li>
