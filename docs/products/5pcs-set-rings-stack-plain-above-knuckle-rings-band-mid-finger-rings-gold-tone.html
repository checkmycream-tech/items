            <li>but I still wear em :)</li>
            <li>Cheap price but very cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more, just for fun.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even fit my pinky</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These rings are so cheap and look nothing like to photo.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Delicate gold bands that are perfect for layering on hand jewelry.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased overall!</li>
            <li>I thought for the price these would be fun to wear.</li>
            <li>They looked very nice when I first received them but they tarnished after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>but they look really cute for regular rings .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the full six only five but its cool.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these rings.</li>
            <li>so they could actually fit the middle part of my fingers.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work</li>
            <li>These were better quality rings than expected.</li>
            <li>These kinda took a long time to get to me, but I love them, they are super thing, and fit really well, they did leave a green ring around my fingers but that took like a week of none</li>
            <li>Not disappointed because they were only like a dollar</li>
            <li>The gold came off the first day and they didn&#x27;t come in different sizes to fit different fingers.</li>
            <li>I have purchased stackable sets from other sellers and they vary in size making them easy to stack.  </li>
            <li>When I tried these on, they fit loosely on my size 6 index finger, so clearly these were not midi rings.</li>
            <li>If you have use for 5 rings the same exact size, go for it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend painting them with a clear nail polish or spraying them with a clear coat</li>
            <li>I needed a size 5.5 to make these fit properly and they are just a little tiny bit too big, also the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; wore off really quickly</li>
            <li>Too big, sharp edges, turned orange quickly.</li>
            <li>Mine, at least, aren&#x27;t cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Very little and dingy my hands are super skinny because I am skinny.</li>
            <li>They were cheap, but waste of money anyways!!</li>
            <li>Just be aware that the gold paint starts wearing off after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This set has 5 little rings in the exact same size.  </li>

            <li> They also turned my finger green after wearing them for less than an hour.</li>
            <li> if you have products (lotion/soap) on your hand the will turn your fingers green.</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday now.</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> I mean they are just thin bands.</li>
            <li> It was really annoying to order something and get something completely different in the mail.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them. Had them for a year now, and i still wear them.</li>
            <li> Loveeeeddd themm. But I lost em allðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> These kinda took a long time to get to me, but I love them, they are super thing, and fit really well, they did leave a green ring around my fingers but that took like a week of none stop wearing. I will probably order more, just for fun.</li>
            <li> Cheap price but very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Very small. They don&#x27;t even fit my pinky</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 star because they look nice on your fingers but the quality is ok. Just be aware that the gold paint starts wearing off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The gold came off the first day and they didn&#x27;t come in different sizes to fit different fingers. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Although the size is bigger than advertised. It is still a great product. I ordered the gold tone ones and I think they look even better in person.</li>
            <li> I love these rings! They&#x27;re very dainty and pretty. They are all the same size and can be worn as shown. I&#x27;ll be looking for additional sizes like these for my thumb too.</li>
            <li> Very little and dingy my hands are super skinny because I am skinny. Were too tight</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these rings. I mean they are just thin bands. They served their purpose in helping me achieve the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> if you have products (lotion/soap) on your hand the will turn your fingers green. they are really nice and cute but thats the only crappy part</li>
            <li> For the rings to be &amp;#34;stackable&amp;#34; like the current trend, the sizes must vary slightly.  This set has 5 little rings in the exact same size.  You cannot achieve the look in these pictures with these rings.  I have purchased stackable sets from other sellers and they vary in size making them easy to stack.  These don&#x27;t work that way.  If you have use for 5 rings the same exact size, go for it.  If you are looking for the look in the picture, try another seller or buy individual rings in different sizes.</li>
            <li> They looked very nice when I first received them but they tarnished after a few weeks.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I Loved them! Great buy deff worth the money! Came in before the estimated date so I&#x27;m very pleased overall! (I purchased the gold tone)</li>
            <li> I did not receive anything remotely close to the rings I ordered. It was really annoying to order something and get something completely different in the mail. The rings I received were nothing like the description or picture. I didn&#x27;t even bother returning them. But I will definitely not order for the seller again.</li>
            <li> i got mine sooner than i expected so that is good. they look like the pictures and they are very dainty and pretty. the only thing is i wish they were smaller in size so they could actually fit the middle part of my fingers. maybe my fingers are too skinny i don&#x27;t know?? but they should definitely  come in different and smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work and it didn&#x27;t. They are all the same size so I couldn&#x27;t get the affect of &amp;#34;stacked rings&amp;#34; and they tarnished after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> These were all too big to be called Mid rings.... They also turned my finger green after wearing them for less than an hour.</li>
            <li> kinda wish they came in different sizes since our fingers are not all the same width but I still wear em :)</li>
            <li> I thought for the price these would be fun to wear. I was not disappointed. Only problem is to keep from losing them.</li>
            <li> The rings I received are not exactly as described. I was under the impression that these were midi/knuckle rings and as stated in the listing, 16mm (size 5). When I tried these on, they fit loosely on my size 6 index finger, so clearly these were not midi rings. I contacted the seller and he/she kindly refunded me and allowed me to keep the rings. I appreciate that! But please let customers know that these are not midi/knuckle rings.</li>
            <li> I did not get the rings set</li>
            <li> Ordered these thinking that they&#x27;d be midi rings but they are just regular rings. These won&#x27;t be midi unless you have man hands but they look really cute for regular rings . Not disappointed because they were only like a dollar</li>
            <li> I needed a size 5.5 to make these fit properly and they are just a little tiny bit too big, also the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; wore off really quickly</li>
            <li> Too big, sharp edges, turned orange quickly.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail about a month after I ordered it. I didn&#x27;t get the full six only five but its cool. To me feels like plastic rather than metal. I recommend painting them with a clear nail polish or spraying them with a clear coat so they don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Theses rings took 6 weeks to get here and they arrived, I put them on and they were HUGE!! They were cheap, but waste of money anyways!! Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> These were better quality rings than expected. Im pretty happy.</li>
            <li> These rings are so cheap and look nothing like to photo.  This was a total waste of my money and time!</li>
            <li> Delicate gold bands that are perfect for layering on hand jewelry. Mine, at least, aren&#x27;t cheap quality. I wear these everyday now.</li>
            <li> WERE TOO BIG ..PUT USE ON OTHER FINGERS</li>
            <li> I gave this product one of five stars because the rings aren&#x27;t good quality. After only wearing them a few times, the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; wore off, and they turned my fingers green. Very poorly made!</li>
            <li> Dont like them . Not what i expected</li>
            <li> Turned a diff color and I didn&#x27;t even wear them like that</li>
