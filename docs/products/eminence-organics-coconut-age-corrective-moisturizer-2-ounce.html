            <li> This moisturizer is beyond thick.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a heavy layer of mud as you apply it!!</li>

            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use it during the day as well as at night because i live in a dry climate.  It works very well.  I am a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever. Not only is it natural and organic, but it&#x27;s rich and luxurious and makes my skin fee and look amazing!! I highly recommend this product. My daughter who works for a high end spa introduced me to this line by hear were the best gifts that I had received. It is hydrating and makes your skin look young and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Great Price! Shipping was fast and arrived sealed and undamaged. I&#x27;ve been using Eminence products for 3 years and absolutely love how their products make my skin look and feel! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I use Eminence products exclusively and love the richness of this cream.  Would give it 5 stars except it does not provide SPF protection.  I can use it in the winter in the South but not year round.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product and the best moisturiser I have ever used, hands down. Thoroughly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have no idea  what its doing , or not doing . To expect a miracle in a jar is an advertisers dream and a fools paradise . Me being the fool . Ok you want to know if you&#x27;ll wake up looking 10 years younger ? no. Not that the bottle is stating such a claim. I keep my expectations realistic by putting  it on daily in hopes  of maintaining moisture in my skin. I prefer beauty products to be cleaner than most and this serves that purpose. Not crazy about the heavy feel and the length of time it takes to soak into your skin . I&#x27;ll play around with this line some more and get back to you.</li>

            <li> Love it. Quick results. Smells so much better than retinol. A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t shy away because of the price.</li>
            <li> Rave reviews from me!  Watch your skin look so much younger, healthier and smooth as soon as u start using it. All my wrinkles ( I&#x27;m 42) went away. Wow!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is beyond thick.  I break out in a full on sweat after putting it on.  It clogs my pours as well.  It smells good,, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what you get.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Love the smell, love how it makes my face feel and love how it makes my face look!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this is the original, definitely didn&#x27;t smell like coconut, and its much dryer</li>
