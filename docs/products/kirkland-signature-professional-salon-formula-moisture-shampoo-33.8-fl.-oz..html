            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>So, I was very happy when I found this product since it seems to be a knock-off of the Pureology.  </li>

            <li>Great for color treated hair like mine.</li>
            <li>and it makes it feel great.</li>
            <li>For nine dollars a bottle (seven for the conditioner), I thought it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>They work great to keep my hair happy.  </li>

            <li>Very kind to your hair, quality product, great value.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes amazing lather and is so creamy!</li>
            <li>If you like good shampoo that does</li>
            <li>-Smells good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make your hair gorgeous.</li>
            <li>alot of good shampoo for the money</li>
            <li>It is not as good as Pureology, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it because of the price.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have one, this is still a really good deal.</li>
            <li>the bright side, it does a good job of lathering and cleaning my hair without leaving it feeling stripped or greasy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had good luck with the brand, plus</li>
            <li>I borrowed my daughter&#x27;s bottle when staying with her and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many organic shampoo&#x27;s in the market and this&lt;br /&gt;one is the best out of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most organic shampoos it cleans hair</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, good consistency and works for colored hair.</li>
            <li>The price is great and seems to do a good job with my hair however the smell is so strong and perfumey</li>
            <li>Love it , Love it!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the kirkland shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I just ordered more!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>my hair never felt or smelled better!</li>
            <li>and I even like the Kirkland one better!</li>
            <li>I hope they come out with more beauty products from Kirkland Signature!</li>
            <li>My favorite forever!</li>
            <li>important of all no harmful chemicals!!</li>
            <li>price is amazing at Costco for the quality of this product</li>
            <li>Honestly, I probably would.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner works great, nice lather, and leaves hair manageable and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>it was a nice tall bottle.</li>
            <li>Good lather, refreshing smell, seemed to work well on the rest of my body also.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, very inexpensive, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Has very nice and light smell (not too intrusive).&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I have lots of very fine hair that has a nice wave to it.  </li>
            <li>I am super happy, even did a band aid skin test for an hour before I even tried to see if I was allergic.</li>
            <li>While I like that it is gluten-free, the fragrance is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>shampoo is cost effective for sure.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a sweet, powdery scent, which is pleasant</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair look great the first day, but is too moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very sweet, floral with a twinge of musk, and the smell is VERY VERY STRONG.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but pleasant, and stays in my hair for the 3 full days.</li>
            <li>Smells great and priced very affordably.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>i love this conditioner and wont buy anything else</li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I know many people like, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>hair gets static with this product.</li>
            <li>Would I recommend it to permanently replace anyone&#x27;s favorite shampoo?  </li>
            <li>And by \\&quot;most shampoos\\</li>
            <li>SLS is a chemical composition found in many soapy products; it is what makes them bubbly soapy so do expect a reduction of bubbliness from this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo,(and</li>
            <li>Makes my hair healthy</li>
            <li>I love the pump, i&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, for the price, I&#x27;m okay with clarifying every two weeks to rid my scalp of the buildup greasyiness.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s in love and can&#x27;t stop talking about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>gave this shampoo a longer chance than most people.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to switch up to a more costly brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing that (1) I have to trim my ends more often because of split ends,</li>
            <li>While I love the conditioner, the shampoo is ok.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have a membership, I guess this Amazon seller can help you out :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell but just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit flowery, but nothing over the top.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But its not awful.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li>I love the smell, not flowery, powdery or perfumey at all.</li>
            <li>Healthy.</li>
            <li>I know there are many who have excess oil in their hair and want to get rid of their oily scalp</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It lathers beautifully, smells great, cleans well, and feels nice and thick in my hair.</li>
            <li>shampooing, my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out, and it has a great smell!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and nice, but can&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I receive many compliments of how healthy, shiny and smooth it looks.   </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great when you pump it out, but the scent completely disappears to something like a \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; product during the lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Loves the sulfate free and paraben free-ness :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reach, smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Really like the way it smells.(smells good without being overly fragrant)</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to care for and I don&#x27;t diddle around with it.</li>
            <li>but it is so strongly perfumed that you stink of it for days.</li>
            <li>Had it not been for the strong smell</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty stong, it&#x27;s a good smell, but sweet.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too and he has fine hair</li>
            <li>She has fine hair, but a TON of it.</li>
            <li>Silicone and fine hair don&#x27;t mix.</li>
            <li>Returns are easy if you don&#x27;t love it, so why not give it a shot, right?</li>
            <li>At costco, its $9.99 and its a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>cheap (at Costco, anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been on a roll with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) free products for about a year now.</li>
            <li>I found the Kirkland SLS free shampoo by accident at Costco.</li>
            <li>With SLS free, I wash my hair 3-4 days and have not experience any scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>Since using SLS free I haven&#x27;t experience any damage/breakage to my hair.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth and more.</li>
            <li>plus with this shampoo and conditioner line is it is 100% Vegan, Sulfate Free, and Paraben free.</li>
            <li>It is also paraben free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it actually cleans my hair, without damaging ingredients like sulfates!</li>
            <li>What a great surprise to find that it definitely improved my issues</li>
            <li>I am allergic to wheat and had to find products that were gluten free.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it is gluten free</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has everything that I expect from a shampoo- gf, vegan, paraben/sulfate free, inexpensive, and it works well.</li>
            <li>product makes my over-highlighted hair smooth, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>-Makes hair soft, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The first week of using this shampoo and conditioner my hair felt great, very soft and looked shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the Kirkland Shampoo, but I have strong allergies to perfume and this has too much.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try this for my color treated hair, etc....</li>
            <li>It was nice to find on line since we live about 100 miles from nearest store that sells this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel clean, but does get greasy after day 2.</li>
            <li>Has a clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>the positive side, my hair does feel moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves hair tangle free and combined with the conditioner leaves hair super shiny, full of bounce, and</li>
            <li>My hair felt good and was easy to comb (it&#x27;s about an inch long and is curly.</li>
            <li>tall - so make sure your shower caddy can handle a large bottle like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves your hair smooth, frizz free, shiny, healthy, soft, and protected from any heat styling you will do.  </li>
            <li>SLS-free formula contains gentle cleansers and is designed to be safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li>The cost of pureology was getting to me, so I was looking for something more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I used Keune - delicate hair shampoo for over 10 years &amp; have to say it was one of the best.</li>
            <li>the interest of full disclosure</li>
            <li>I also had to wash my hair more often because my hair would get oily fairly fast.</li>
            <li>I think my hair color also does quite well with this shampoo and seems to not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>4 starsd seems to not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>I switched to this shampoo after being loyal to Pureology for a year.</li>
            <li>I think she is lovely as ever, regardless of the shampoo she uses or the colors she puts in or takes out of her hair, but I can attest definitely attest to increased softness of her lovely locks.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant it  made me gag.</li>
            <li>I stop loosing my hair at very first wash</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s been a good default and lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, mild vanilla scent and is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>It really depends on your needs and your hair type, but in all likelihood... probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s are why I think it might be a handy shampoo to have on-hand for many, and the cons are why I think this product is certainly not a \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; product for many, but most especially, for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a sweet fruity flowerly unique scent that I really like a lot.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and I am able to shampoo my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>Made my hair noticeably softer and shinier after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very, very good like one of the more expensive salon brands I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed to be a reasonable price for a gluten free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The seller just puts faith in the listing that the all organic, natural, vegan, and sulfate free advertising is accurate.</li>
            <li>SLS free shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture away from your hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s a handy product to have in your gym bag and shower.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a member and can&#x27;t get it at the store, it&#x27;s still worth it for the Amazon price.</li>
            <li>Except for the pricing, I find that most SLS free shampoo give similar results.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself having to wash my hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair this morning, I also had difficulty getting it to lay right.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfumey scents, and prefer more natural scents, then don&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is true, however Costco memberships are far from free and if (like me)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only nit-picky thing she could muster is the scent isn&#x27;t her favorite, but certainly not a bad smell...</li>
            <li>It does kind of remind me of an old lady scent, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair, so I&#x27;ll live with it.  </li>
            <li>(SEE CONS)-&lt;br /&gt;*Probably a great product for those who want to shampoo daily, such as persons who go to the gym every day</li>
            <li>(If I don&#x27;t use a product like TGI After Party, but After Party smells amazing so the need to use it also counteracts the completely \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; consequences of the con listed directly above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even think of a salon product in recent memory that I have liked as much as I like this.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews state that this shampoo causes more buildup after a few washes of use.</li>
            <li>Mourning the loss of her soft, healthy hair after all the processing and using what she thought was high quality stuff...</li>
            <li>I typically love Kirkland Signature products and definitely am used to experiencing quality products when I buy from Costco, but this stuff blew that out of the water.</li>
            <li>Will definitely repurchase Kirkland Sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li>I am unable to go to Costco and am very happy that I can buy this on line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Evercreme until I can transition to something better.</li>
            <li>Held them up to the light and they were completely covered with film.</li>
            <li>This gluten free shampoo leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was more than enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>bottle isn&#x27;t exactly the prettiest thing in my shower but it also doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;lady product\\&quot; and scare away my man from using it.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft (I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner) and shiney!!</li>
            <li>that is going gray far too early and is obviously more coarse that her lovely auburn hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and the pump is great, distributing just enough for my past</li>
            <li>You need very little to get a good wash</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your hair and scalp feel clean, it smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down or oily.</li>
            <li>the positive note, it worked for my mother.</li>
            <li>So below is my review of SLS free shampoo in general, which would apply to this Kirkland brand.  </li>
            <li>In my never ending quest for a sulfate free shampoo that was safe for the whole family to use and upon glowing reviews from my mother-in-law, I picked up a bottle of this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago during a trip to Costco.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Pureology Nano and I like it just as much</li>
            <li>However, I really like the way my hair feels and looks the first day after using it so I will probably just stick with it and use a clarifying shampoo once a week</li>
            <li>and I also used to be able to use dry shampoo without adding build up but</li>
            <li>I notice that it IS more moisturized and glossy when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Overall being partially organic and more natural than most shampoos I find it worth the cost and would recommend, despite the unusual smell.</li>
            <li>First day was great, after a few washes felt like it left a waxie film.  </li>
            <li>with this product I have not been able to, my hair is just too oily and there is too much build up for it to handle a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Yes, amazingly contradictory to what I said about the grease, but this product somehow manages to leave you with greasy tangled messy hair every time.  </li>
            <li>I am very thankful I found this.</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped calm his itching scalp.  </li>
            <li>I recently had a brazilian blowout and was told I needed to use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>really well.  </li>
            <li>I rinse it thoroughly though since it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li>I said in the pro&#x27;s, I really like the scent of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With the above reasons, as pricey as SLS free shampoo are...</li>
            <li>This really is my wife&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li>I do find that my hair needs to be washed more often using this, but that&#x27;s probably because my scalp is finally producing natural oils again thanks to the lack of sulfates.</li>
            <li>really* don&#x27;t like the &#x27;wood glue&#x27; consistency</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need extra since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really works for me</li>
            <li>the price is too much</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and cleanses the scalp very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>My scalp tends to get very oily much faster</li>
            <li>By the way the product is much cheaper at Costco @ $7.99 and $8.99</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much because it lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped/stringey/</li>
            <li>Someone was not thinking straight while deciding formulation ratios in this one.</li>
            <li>This product is very creamy.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo minus the scent.</li>
            <li>I really like about it</li>
            <li>They may have improved since then for all I know, but the difference between salon vs. drugstore was so significant that I never went back, and my venturing out to trying</li>
            <li>BUT I find it makes my hair flat, like too silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It is filled with silicone based ingredients that make my hair look greasy and flat after maybe 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>Many people rave about this product due to the AMOUNT of product you get for the price</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because i needed something that would be very moisturizing, but i found this shampoo stripped my hair of natural oils and made it even more dry and frizzy than it was before.</li>
            <li>If you use more, it will really weigh down your hair</li>
            <li>I bought a huge bottle of Kirkland \\&quot;Ultra Luxurious\\&quot; Moisture shampoo the other day at Costco and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>We love Costco and Kirkland Signature brand and can&#x27;t think of time that either of them have let us down on a purchase.</li>
            <li>It also does a fantastic job in helping blow dry and style it.</li>
            <li>but I guess it more or less smells like a mix of both, loads of tootsie rolls and flavored coffee.</li>
            <li>Highly sensitive to chemicals and can&#x27;t really use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Even with daily (or more than daily!)</li>
            <li>So now I only use it when I need a quick hair fix before I go out.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have extensive experience in the salon and spa industry, and was in education, management and sales for a major distributorship of professional salon products including everything from Aveda to Schwarzkopf and everything in between.  </li>
            <li>highly alkaline and \\&quot;clarifying\\</li>
            <li>Ipaid a little bit more for it on line but saved gas and wear and tear on the car.  </li>
            <li>I have used it even on the baby fine hair of my two year old, as well as the coarse, curly hair of my 12 year old-</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m used to using salon shampoos, so I&#x27;m usedto my hair smelling amazing for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li>and it looks a lot more limp and without volume.</li>
            <li>No residue, no weighing it down, no drying it out, just healthy natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing to remember is to use the normal amount of shampoo, but use less than half of your normal amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thick, rich lather and the smell is soothing and sweet.  </li>
            <li>Looking for something new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sadly, I live 80 miles from the nearest Costco but Amazon came to the rescue.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by describing my hair type first, therefore those with similar hair types can stay away from this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, nothing bad and nothing good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slightly picky about my shampoo/conditioner, I like it to be sulfate free because I color my hair.</li>
            <li>Now I do have fine hair, but have never  had this problem with other products I have used/tried, whether high end or mid price.  </li>
            <li>I have a full head of long, bleach blonde, wavy, fine, oily hair and it makes my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>But look closely at the ingredients and there are a lot of chemicals with long names that show that it&#x27;s a lot like so many other shampoos out there</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a rush, I don&#x27;t even use the conditioner and my hair is still really soft.</li>
            <li>And my hair is completely absent of any scent after my shower.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a shampoo that is completely organic, keep looking.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old, and YES this smells LIKE FOR OLD PEOPLE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to smell and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Although I color my hair frequently, I still must be concerned about the fade factor.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is very fine and very thin, with no body - this stuff just doesn&#x27;t leave it clean enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>I used to use a much more expensive brand and while effective, I can get 33oz of this product for the same price as the 7oz of the other brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finds she needs less of this product than other high quality shampoos, resulting in even more savings&lt;</li>
            <li>use one full pump of the shampoo each time I wash my slightly above-the-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>have side-swept bangs, which look and dry amazing after shampooing with this product, but they seriously stick up on end like Mary in the movie</li>
            <li>I color at least once a month, and my hair feels fantastic after using this.  </li>
            <li>However, this is the shampoo that I use on my hair for at least the first week after color in order to help get it back into human hair condition (I also use Wen 6-13 as an intense conditioner for 1-2 days to moisturize it).  </li>
            <li>, my hair is very fine in texture, extremely thick (I have a ton of hair), and is slightly wavy/has body.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos that contain sulfates, but it has decent lather.</li>
            <li>however this shampoo literally STRIPS all the natural oils from your hair leaving it dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it the first time, but after using this just a few times my hair feels GROSS.</li>
            <li>My experience in using SLS free shampoo is less frequency in hair washing because my scalp won&#x27;t have that yucky oily buildup (it does take a few washes before you get to this point</li>
            <li>Not great for my fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> alot of good shampoo for the money</li>
            <li> It is not as good as Pureology, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it because of the price.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have one, this is still a really good deal.</li>
            <li> the bright side, it does a good job of lathering and cleaning my hair without leaving it feeling stripped or greasy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had good luck with the brand, plus</li>
            <li> I borrowed my daughter&#x27;s bottle when staying with her and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many organic shampoo&#x27;s in the market and this&lt;br /&gt;one is the best out of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most organic shampoos it cleans hair</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, good consistency and works for colored hair.</li>
            <li> The price is great and seems to do a good job with my hair however the smell is so strong and perfumey</li>
            <li> Love it , Love it!!</li>

            <li> my hair never felt or smelled better!</li>
            <li> and I even like the Kirkland one better!</li>
            <li> I hope they come out with more beauty products from Kirkland Signature!</li>
            <li> My favorite forever!</li>
            <li> important of all no harmful chemicals!!</li>
            <li> price is amazing at Costco for the quality of this product</li>
            <li> Honestly, I probably would.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works great, nice lather, and leaves hair manageable and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> it was a nice tall bottle.</li>
            <li> Good lather, refreshing smell, seemed to work well on the rest of my body also.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, very inexpensive, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Has very nice and light smell (not too intrusive).&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I have lots of very fine hair that has a nice wave to it.  </li>
            <li> I am super happy, even did a band aid skin test for an hour before I even tried to see if I was allergic.</li>
            <li> While I like that it is gluten-free, the fragrance is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> shampoo is cost effective for sure.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a sweet, powdery scent, which is pleasant</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair look great the first day, but is too moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is very sweet, floral with a twinge of musk, and the smell is VERY VERY STRONG.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but pleasant, and stays in my hair for the 3 full days.</li>
            <li> Smells great and priced very affordably.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner and wont buy anything else</li>
            <li> my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I know many people like, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> hair gets static with this product.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend it to permanently replace anyone&#x27;s favorite shampoo?  </li>
            <li> And by \\&quot;most shampoos\\</li>
            <li> SLS is a chemical composition found in many soapy products; it is what makes them bubbly soapy so do expect a reduction of bubbliness from this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo,(and</li>
            <li> Makes my hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love the pump, i&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , for the price, I&#x27;m okay with clarifying every two weeks to rid my scalp of the buildup greasyiness.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s in love and can&#x27;t stop talking about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> gave this shampoo a longer chance than most people.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to switch up to a more costly brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing that (1) I have to trim my ends more often because of split ends,</li>
            <li> While I love the conditioner, the shampoo is ok.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have a membership, I guess this Amazon seller can help you out :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell but just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit flowery, but nothing over the top.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the scent of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But its not awful.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li> I love the smell, not flowery, powdery or perfumey at all.</li>
            <li> Healthy.</li>
            <li> I know there are many who have excess oil in their hair and want to get rid of their oily scalp</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lathers beautifully, smells great, cleans well, and feels nice and thick in my hair.</li>
            <li> shampooing, my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out, and it has a great smell!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and nice, but can&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I receive many compliments of how healthy, shiny and smooth it looks.   </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great when you pump it out, but the scent completely disappears to something like a \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; product during the lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Loves the sulfate free and paraben free-ness :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reach, smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it smells.(smells good without being overly fragrant)</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to care for and I don&#x27;t diddle around with it.</li>
            <li> but it is so strongly perfumed that you stink of it for days.</li>
            <li> Had it not been for the strong smell</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty stong, it&#x27;s a good smell, but sweet.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it too and he has fine hair</li>
            <li> She has fine hair, but a TON of it.</li>
            <li> Silicone and fine hair don&#x27;t mix.</li>
            <li> Returns are easy if you don&#x27;t love it, so why not give it a shot, right?</li>
            <li> At costco, its $9.99 and its a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> cheap (at Costco, anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been on a roll with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) free products for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I found the Kirkland SLS free shampoo by accident at Costco.</li>
            <li> With SLS free, I wash my hair 3-4 days and have not experience any scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Since using SLS free I haven&#x27;t experience any damage/breakage to my hair.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth and more.</li>
            <li> plus with this shampoo and conditioner line is it is 100% Vegan, Sulfate Free, and Paraben free.</li>
            <li> It is also paraben free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it actually cleans my hair, without damaging ingredients like sulfates!</li>
            <li> What a great surprise to find that it definitely improved my issues</li>
            <li> I am allergic to wheat and had to find products that were gluten free.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it is gluten free</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has everything that I expect from a shampoo- gf, vegan, paraben/sulfate free, inexpensive, and it works well.</li>
            <li> product makes my over-highlighted hair smooth, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> -Makes hair soft, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The first week of using this shampoo and conditioner my hair felt great, very soft and looked shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the Kirkland Shampoo, but I have strong allergies to perfume and this has too much.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try this for my color treated hair, etc....</li>
            <li> It was nice to find on line since we live about 100 miles from nearest store that sells this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel clean, but does get greasy after day 2.</li>
            <li> Has a clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the positive side, my hair does feel moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves hair tangle free and combined with the conditioner leaves hair super shiny, full of bounce, and</li>
            <li> My hair felt good and was easy to comb (it&#x27;s about an inch long and is curly.</li>
            <li> tall - so make sure your shower caddy can handle a large bottle like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves your hair smooth, frizz free, shiny, healthy, soft, and protected from any heat styling you will do.  </li>
            <li> SLS-free formula contains gentle cleansers and is designed to be safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> The cost of pureology was getting to me, so I was looking for something more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used Keune - delicate hair shampoo for over 10 years &amp; have to say it was one of the best.</li>
            <li> the interest of full disclosure</li>
            <li> I also had to wash my hair more often because my hair would get oily fairly fast.</li>
            <li> I think my hair color also does quite well with this shampoo and seems to not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> 4 starsd seems to not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo after being loyal to Pureology for a year.</li>
            <li> I think she is lovely as ever, regardless of the shampoo she uses or the colors she puts in or takes out of her hair, but I can attest definitely attest to increased softness of her lovely locks.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant it  made me gag.</li>
            <li> I stop loosing my hair at very first wash</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been a good default and lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, mild vanilla scent and is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It really depends on your needs and your hair type, but in all likelihood... probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s are why I think it might be a handy shampoo to have on-hand for many, and the cons are why I think this product is certainly not a \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; product for many, but most especially, for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a sweet fruity flowerly unique scent that I really like a lot.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and I am able to shampoo my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> Made my hair noticeably softer and shinier after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very, very good like one of the more expensive salon brands I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a reasonable price for a gluten free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The seller just puts faith in the listing that the all organic, natural, vegan, and sulfate free advertising is accurate.</li>
            <li> SLS free shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture away from your hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s a handy product to have in your gym bag and shower.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a member and can&#x27;t get it at the store, it&#x27;s still worth it for the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Except for the pricing, I find that most SLS free shampoo give similar results.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I find myself having to wash my hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair this morning, I also had difficulty getting it to lay right.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfumey scents, and prefer more natural scents, then don&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is true, however Costco memberships are far from free and if (like me)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only nit-picky thing she could muster is the scent isn&#x27;t her favorite, but certainly not a bad smell...</li>
            <li> It does kind of remind me of an old lady scent, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair, so I&#x27;ll live with it.  </li>
            <li> (SEE CONS)-&lt;br /&gt;*Probably a great product for those who want to shampoo daily, such as persons who go to the gym every day</li>
            <li> (If I don&#x27;t use a product like TGI After Party, but After Party smells amazing so the need to use it also counteracts the completely \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; consequences of the con listed directly above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even think of a salon product in recent memory that I have liked as much as I like this.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews state that this shampoo causes more buildup after a few washes of use.</li>
            <li> Mourning the loss of her soft, healthy hair after all the processing and using what she thought was high quality stuff...</li>
            <li> I typically love Kirkland Signature products and definitely am used to experiencing quality products when I buy from Costco, but this stuff blew that out of the water.</li>
            <li> Will definitely repurchase Kirkland Sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li> I am unable to go to Costco and am very happy that I can buy this on line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Evercreme until I can transition to something better.</li>
            <li> Held them up to the light and they were completely covered with film.</li>
            <li> This gluten free shampoo leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was more than enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> bottle isn&#x27;t exactly the prettiest thing in my shower but it also doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;lady product\\&quot; and scare away my man from using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft (I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner) and shiney!!</li>
            <li> that is going gray far too early and is obviously more coarse that her lovely auburn hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the pump is great, distributing just enough for my past</li>
            <li> You need very little to get a good wash</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your hair and scalp feel clean, it smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down or oily.</li>
            <li> the positive note, it worked for my mother.</li>
            <li> So below is my review of SLS free shampoo in general, which would apply to this Kirkland brand.  </li>
            <li> In my never ending quest for a sulfate free shampoo that was safe for the whole family to use and upon glowing reviews from my mother-in-law, I picked up a bottle of this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago during a trip to Costco.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Pureology Nano and I like it just as much</li>
            <li> However, I really like the way my hair feels and looks the first day after using it so I will probably just stick with it and use a clarifying shampoo once a week</li>
            <li> and I also used to be able to use dry shampoo without adding build up but</li>
            <li> I notice that it IS more moisturized and glossy when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Overall being partially organic and more natural than most shampoos I find it worth the cost and would recommend, despite the unusual smell.</li>
            <li> First day was great, after a few washes felt like it left a waxie film.  </li>
            <li> with this product I have not been able to, my hair is just too oily and there is too much build up for it to handle a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Yes, amazingly contradictory to what I said about the grease, but this product somehow manages to leave you with greasy tangled messy hair every time.  </li>
            <li> I am very thankful I found this.</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped calm his itching scalp.  </li>
            <li> I recently had a brazilian blowout and was told I needed to use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> really well.  </li>
            <li> I rinse it thoroughly though since it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li> I said in the pro&#x27;s, I really like the scent of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With the above reasons, as pricey as SLS free shampoo are...</li>
            <li> This really is my wife&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> I do find that my hair needs to be washed more often using this, but that&#x27;s probably because my scalp is finally producing natural oils again thanks to the lack of sulfates.</li>
            <li> really* don&#x27;t like the &#x27;wood glue&#x27; consistency</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need extra since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really works for me</li>
            <li> the price is too much</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and cleanses the scalp very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to get very oily much faster</li>
            <li> By the way the product is much cheaper at Costco @ $7.99 and $8.99</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much because it lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped/stringey/</li>
            <li> Someone was not thinking straight while deciding formulation ratios in this one.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo minus the scent.</li>
            <li> I really like about it</li>
            <li> They may have improved since then for all I know, but the difference between salon vs. drugstore was so significant that I never went back, and my venturing out to trying</li>
            <li> BUT I find it makes my hair flat, like too silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It is filled with silicone based ingredients that make my hair look greasy and flat after maybe 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> Many people rave about this product due to the AMOUNT of product you get for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because i needed something that would be very moisturizing, but i found this shampoo stripped my hair of natural oils and made it even more dry and frizzy than it was before.</li>
            <li> If you use more, it will really weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> I bought a huge bottle of Kirkland \\&quot;Ultra Luxurious\\&quot; Moisture shampoo the other day at Costco and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> We love Costco and Kirkland Signature brand and can&#x27;t think of time that either of them have let us down on a purchase.</li>
            <li> It also does a fantastic job in helping blow dry and style it.</li>
            <li> but I guess it more or less smells like a mix of both, loads of tootsie rolls and flavored coffee.</li>
            <li> Highly sensitive to chemicals and can&#x27;t really use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Even with daily (or more than daily!)</li>
            <li> So now I only use it when I need a quick hair fix before I go out.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have extensive experience in the salon and spa industry, and was in education, management and sales for a major distributorship of professional salon products including everything from Aveda to Schwarzkopf and everything in between.  </li>
            <li> highly alkaline and \\&quot;clarifying\\</li>
            <li> Ipaid a little bit more for it on line but saved gas and wear and tear on the car.  </li>
            <li> I have used it even on the baby fine hair of my two year old, as well as the coarse, curly hair of my 12 year old-</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m used to using salon shampoos, so I&#x27;m usedto my hair smelling amazing for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li> and it looks a lot more limp and without volume.</li>
            <li> No residue, no weighing it down, no drying it out, just healthy natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing to remember is to use the normal amount of shampoo, but use less than half of your normal amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich lather and the smell is soothing and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Looking for something new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I live 80 miles from the nearest Costco but Amazon came to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my hair type first, therefore those with similar hair types can stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, nothing bad and nothing good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly picky about my shampoo/conditioner, I like it to be sulfate free because I color my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I do have fine hair, but have never  had this problem with other products I have used/tried, whether high end or mid price.  </li>
            <li> I have a full head of long, bleach blonde, wavy, fine, oily hair and it makes my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> But look closely at the ingredients and there are a lot of chemicals with long names that show that it&#x27;s a lot like so many other shampoos out there</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a rush, I don&#x27;t even use the conditioner and my hair is still really soft.</li>
            <li> And my hair is completely absent of any scent after my shower.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo that is completely organic, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, and YES this smells LIKE FOR OLD PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to smell and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Although I color my hair frequently, I still must be concerned about the fade factor.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is very fine and very thin, with no body - this stuff just doesn&#x27;t leave it clean enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> I used to use a much more expensive brand and while effective, I can get 33oz of this product for the same price as the 7oz of the other brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finds she needs less of this product than other high quality shampoos, resulting in even more savings&lt;</li>
            <li> use one full pump of the shampoo each time I wash my slightly above-the-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> have side-swept bangs, which look and dry amazing after shampooing with this product, but they seriously stick up on end like Mary in the movie</li>
            <li> I color at least once a month, and my hair feels fantastic after using this.  </li>
            <li> However, this is the shampoo that I use on my hair for at least the first week after color in order to help get it back into human hair condition (I also use Wen 6-13 as an intense conditioner for 1-2 days to moisturize it).  </li>
            <li> , my hair is very fine in texture, extremely thick (I have a ton of hair), and is slightly wavy/has body.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos that contain sulfates, but it has decent lather.</li>
            <li> however this shampoo literally STRIPS all the natural oils from your hair leaving it dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it the first time, but after using this just a few times my hair feels GROSS.</li>
            <li> My experience in using SLS free shampoo is less frequency in hair washing because my scalp won&#x27;t have that yucky oily buildup (it does take a few washes before you get to this point</li>
            <li> Not great for my fine hair</li>
            <li> a side note, I noticed other reviews for this product commented about the lack of lather, but for me, yes, this product definitely had a lot less lather on the first shampooing (as with most shampoos) but on the second it lathered to an insane degree (as with most shampoos).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells however this shampoo/conditioner smells stronger than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> By the second day my hair is flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but found the same problems as a few others.</li>
            <li> I would perhaps recommend this to somebody with very dry hair, but otherwise it weighed down the hair too much and made it too greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (middle back) medium texture, color treated</li>
            <li> Much like many others who tried this product over Pureology, I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I always get a little annoyed with products like this which make it sound like it&#x27;s a natural, organic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a really strong fragrance smell (heavily perfumed) and leaves a greasy thick buildup in my hair.</li>
            <li> -tames my hair to the point where styling it with a flat iron or curling iron makes my hair stick to my scalp and just \\&quot;hang flat\\&quot; and lifeless (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li> There is not a complete list of ingredients on this product prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> Thought something was really wrong with me when my hair started falling out by the handfuls and my hair became brittle and knotted easily.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Tried this product sort of by accident - I was visiting family for a long weekend and it was in the guest shower</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about it a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like bergamont or Earl Grey tea and cocoa.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, the only product I could buy conveniently and less costly than those from health food stores was from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I am taking mine back to Costco due to the perfume.</li>
            <li> This product contains PEG-120 in addition to polyquaternium-10 and tons of other ingredients that are actually linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> so I was washing my hair daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> (2) this moisture shampoo has yet to cure my dry scalp, (3) the fragrance is one of those lingering scents that doesn&#x27;t truly wash out, and</li>
            <li> Always bought very expensive shampoo from the Beauty Salon and this works better.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I mean salon shampoos, not drugstore because I haven&#x27;t used a drug store shampoo since high school, probably.  </li>
            <li> Previously, the only shampoo I could use was Head and Shoulder.</li>
            <li> Previous to using this I used a bunch of different shampoos (garnier, dove, treseme)</li>
            <li> With its lavender and chocolate color swirled with iridescence to the thick and dense foamy lather, if oozes higher quality.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find SLS free at the general stores but can be found expensively at health food stores.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and coarse asian hair.</li>
            <li> I pumped a little bit out onto the back of my hand</li>
            <li> Hard to see how such a massive increase could be warranted.</li>
            <li> Its smell does not bother me and it does leave my hair soft, but I found it weighed down my hair and made it very limp.</li>
            <li> If you can get it at the store definitely go for it - it&#x27;s less than half the price than on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Loreal Evercreme because of the intensely fake vanilla smell and the high cost (thought not as much as other brands of course), however it left my hair truly moisturized</li>
            <li> have thick, long (lower back length), wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Among them:  - GREASY BUILDUP: I do not know what the other reviewers are smoking but this is the greasiest nastiest stuff on the face of the planet.</li>
            <li> Never had this problem with any other hair product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to shampoo my hair every other day or every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair about every other day or every two days, but 2 weeks into using this product</li>
            <li> I hated paying $50 for a liter of shampoo, so now I can use a much more affordable product that lasts for months and does the same job.</li>
            <li> I usually use 2-2.5 pumps of conditioner for my shoulder length hair, but I use only half a pump of Kirkland.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling greasy and I had wash it everyday instead of every other day like I usually do.</li>
            <li> however it is not worth</li>
            <li> the conditioner) I have coarse, thick hair</li>
            <li> Once I work it into my hair, the shampoo does develop a thick lather, but it takes a bit of work, and obviously, quite a bit of shampoo, to get it this point.</li>
            <li> far, I have never been disappointed with any of the Kirkland Signature products I have bought from Costco and they are of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for 3 solid, awful weeks before I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and went out and bought a bottle of Aussie instead (which works 10x better, might I add).  </li>
            <li> and it costs way less than Pureology (about $60 less)</li>
            <li> This shampoo will not allow for anything less than</li>
            <li> Less frequency of hair washing means that you preserve the moisture in the hair and thereby strengtens the hair strands.</li>
            <li> And, the less shampoo you would use.   </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy with a tendency to frizz, but when I use Kirkland Moisture Shampoo, it makes the straightening process easier</li>
            <li> and I have significantly less frizz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been about a month and a half</li>
            <li> Please be advised that if you buy AT Costco it is less then half the price.  </li>
            <li> Just typical shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I fear that it is being discontinued as well as stock is very limited and is also not available on Costco&#x27;s website when it is their product!  </li>
            <li> I like to shampoo every other day because my hair is color treated and excessive washing wears down your color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, so it weighed my hair down..</li>
            <li> It smells like nothing whatsoever, not clean, not anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I smeared thick hand lotion evenly through my hair and let it dry.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tired of using the same shampoo over and over, so I switch it around.</li>
            <li> I have a few of my friends hooked on it.</li>
            <li> and I treat my hair with curling iron/hair straightener almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This shampoo creates a lot of buildup on my hair, making it feel heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with heavy dandruff and itchy scalp for a while.</li>
            <li> or if the tube is narrow.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just the most horrible thing I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t a problem when I could afford a salon cut and color, but now I&#x27;m forced to use the hair color products in the drugstore and they destroy my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use a hair straighter to tame the frizzies!  </li>
            <li> , not sure if that&#x27;s because the product itself is soo thick</li>
            <li> I find it hard to pump.</li>
            <li> , seems to reduce/eliminate flaking from scalp that is common in winter months</li>
            <li> Even my husband complained about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this in late 2012</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay twice this amount at least.  </li>
            <li> As Amazon can attest from my order history,  a bottle lasts at least five to six months</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am gluten, corn, dairy intolerant. Highly sensitive to chemicals and can&#x27;t really use a whole lot. This smells awesome, my hair feels great. You need very little to get a good wash and I have long hair. I am super happy, even did a band aid skin test for an hour before I even tried to see if I was allergic. I am very thankful I found this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the kirkland shampoo and conditioner! I just ordered more! My kids also use the conditioner. Great for color treated hair like mine. Did not fade! Smells great and priced very affordably. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just the most horrible thing I have ever used. And Pert Plus used to be my shampoo of choice in college. This stuff is EVERYTHING I don&#x27;t want in a shampoo. Among them:  - GREASY BUILDUP: I do not know what the other reviewers are smoking but this is the greasiest nastiest stuff on the face of the planet. After using this, 2 hours later I would feel greasy and gross and feel like I needed another shower. Never had this problem with any other hair product.  - NASTY FRAGRENCE: If you like smelling like old-lady farts, then this stuff is for you. Otherwise, stay the hell away from this product if you don&#x27;t like having greasy stinky hair.  - I plan to leave a review on the Conditioner page as well, but this stuff does NOTHING to soften or de-tangle your hair. Yes, amazingly contradictory to what I said about the grease, but this product somehow manages to leave you with greasy tangled messy hair every time.  Don&#x27;t think that I have such a biased view. I typically love Kirkland Signature products and definitely am used to experiencing quality products when I buy from Costco, but this stuff blew that out of the water. Also, don&#x27;t think I didn&#x27;t get it a chance either. I used this stuff for 3 solid, awful weeks before I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and went out and bought a bottle of Aussie instead (which works 10x better, might I add).  If you like good shampoo that does it&#x27;s job and doesn&#x27;t reek, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS!</li>
            <li> I love the Kirkland Shampoo, but I have strong allergies to perfume and this has too much. I am taking mine back to Costco due to the perfume. But, it did wonders on my highlighted hair to make it shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was purchased for my husband who has celiac disease.  It seemed to be a reasonable price for a gluten free shampoo.  So far, it has helped calm his itching scalp.  This shampoo smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of drug store and sally&#x27;s beauty salon shampoo products, but I always come back to this one. I have long, thick, and coarse asian hair. It lathers beautifully, smells great, cleans well, and feels nice and thick in my hair. My hair gets tired of using the same shampoo over and over, so I switch it around. But my hair never seems to get sick of this shampoo. So it&#x27;s been a good default and lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li> I recently had a brazilian blowout and was told I needed to use sulfate free shampoo. I bought the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner, which I love but is too expensive. Given that Moroccanoil shampoo needs to be re-applied I wanted to use a cheaper shampoo for the 1st wash and followed by the Moroccanoil for the second wash. I can tell you... my hair never felt or smelled better! This shampoo makes amazing lather and is so creamy! Will definitely repurchase Kirkland Sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li> YES!!!!!!! i love this conditioner and wont buy anything else BUT this and the matching shampoo. my favorite. smells wonderful, makes my hair feel deliciously moist and shiney, and cant beat the price!!!!!!!! has almost all the same ingredients as Pureology.</li>
            <li> -Smells good.  -Lathers really well.  -Makes hair soft, shiny and gorgeous.  I use this with the conditioner and it&#x27;s just wonderful. Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a rush, I don&#x27;t even use the conditioner and my hair is still really soft. The conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy but moisturizes really well.  Seriously, just buy this shampoo. It&#x27;ll make your hair gorgeous.</li>
            <li> alot of good shampoo for the money</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo along with the conditioner for about two years and I just love it. It smells exactly like Pureology Nano and I like it just as much and it costs way less than Pureology (about $60 less) I have a full head of long, bleach blonde, wavy, fine, oily hair and it makes my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down. I rinse it thoroughly though since it&#x27;s very creamy. I have a few of my friends hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Very kind to your hair, quality product, great value.</li>
            <li> This is my subjective review based on my hair type and personal opinions, so take it for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my hair is very fine in texture, extremely thick (I have a ton of hair), and is slightly wavy/has body.  Not damaged or color treated, but the wave/body of my hair type can have a slight fizziness or poof if I use the wrong products(i.e. highly alkaline and \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the review of *this* product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tames (if not **over-tames** for my hair type, SEE CONS) frizz and poof-hair -&lt;br /&gt;*Provides a lot of shine/slickness -&lt;br /&gt;*Moisturizes scalp, seems to reduce/eliminate flaking from scalp that is common in winter months -&lt;br /&gt;*Fabulous scent, it&#x27;s a sweet fruity flowerly unique scent that I really like a lot.  But it&#x27;s faint. (SEE CONS)-&lt;br /&gt;*Probably a great product for those who want to shampoo daily, such as persons who go to the gym every day -&lt;br /&gt;*Dirt cheap (at Costco, anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Over-tames my hair to the point where styling it with a flat iron or curling iron makes my hair stick to my scalp and just \\&quot;hang flat\\&quot; and lifeless (if that makes sense).  All body is counteracted with this shampoo. (Again, for my hair type.)-&lt;br /&gt;*I have to shampoo **every day**.  Which I know many people like, but I don&#x27;t.  I prefer to shampoo my hair every other day or every 3 days.  This shampoo will not allow for anything less than **daily** shampooing(again, for my hair type).  My hair looks like a dirty \\&quot;haven&#x27;t washed my hair for a month\\&quot; mess after 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have side-swept bangs, which look and dry amazing after shampooing with this product, but they seriously stick up on end like Mary in the movie \\&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary\\&quot; after only one day. Only greasy instead of &#x27;crunchy&#x27; or whatever was going on with her bangs after the &#x27;incident.&#x27; -&lt;br /&gt;*As I said in the pro&#x27;s, I really like the scent of this shampoo.  But I&#x27;m used to using salon shampoos, so I&#x27;m usedto my hair smelling amazing for at least 2 days.  This shampoo smells great when you pump it out, but the scent completely disappears to something like a \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; product during the lather.  It just..vanishes.  And my hair is completely absent of any scent after my shower.  It smells like nothing whatsoever, not clean, not anything.  That may be a pro for some, but it&#x27;s a big fat con for me.  And it&#x27;s especially disappointing because this is probably the best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;*My hair gets static with this product. (If I don&#x27;t use a product like TGI After Party, but After Party smells amazing so the need to use it also counteracts the completely \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; consequences of the con listed directly above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this shampoo?  Honestly, I probably would.  I definitely think it&#x27;s a handy product to have in your gym bag and shower.  Would I recommend it to permanently replace anyone&#x27;s favorite shampoo?  It really depends on your needs and your hair type, but in all likelihood... probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s are why I think it might be a handy shampoo to have on-hand for many, and the cons are why I think this product is certainly not a \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; product for many, but most especially, for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I noticed other reviews for this product commented about the lack of lather, but for me, yes, this product definitely had a lot less lather on the first shampooing (as with most shampoos) but on the second it lathered to an insane degree (as with most shampoos).  And by \\&quot;most shampoos\\&quot; I mean salon shampoos, not drugstore because I haven&#x27;t used a drug store shampoo since high school, probably.  So, 15 years?  They may have improved since then for all I know, but the difference between salon vs. drugstore was so significant that I never went back, and my venturing out to trying this Kirkland brand shampoo was only because I deeply respect and trust Costco.</li>
            <li> Tried this product sort of by accident - I was visiting family for a long weekend and it was in the guest shower so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m slightly picky about my shampoo/conditioner, I like it to be sulfate free because I color my hair. I was so impressed with this product. I used to use a much more expensive brand and while effective, I can get 33oz of this product for the same price as the 7oz of the other brand and I even like the Kirkland one better! This shampoo and conditioner works great, nice lather, and leaves hair manageable and silky smooth. If you can get it at the store definitely go for it - it&#x27;s less than half the price than on Amazon. If you&#x27;re not a member and can&#x27;t get it at the store, it&#x27;s still worth it for the Amazon price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Looked at this shampoo yesterday but forgot to add to order. Went back today and it had jumped in price from $12.05 to $18.50. Hard to see how such a massive increase could be warranted.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It was nice to find on line since we live about 100 miles from nearest store that sells this shampoo.  Ipaid a little bit more for it on line but saved gas and wear and tear on the car.  I would definitely recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> There is not a complete list of ingredients on this product prior to purchasing. The seller just puts faith in the listing that the all organic, natural, vegan, and sulfate free advertising is accurate. This is NOT the case. If you are looking for a shampoo that is completely organic, keep looking. This is just a way over-priced shampoo that you can buy at any salon. This product contains PEG-120 in addition to polyquaternium-10 and tons of other ingredients that are actually linked to cancer. Do your research. I am very disappointed at the misrepresentation of this item.</li>
            <li> I have been on a roll with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) free products for about a year now. It is hard to find SLS free at the general stores but can be found expensively at health food stores. Recently, the only product I could buy conveniently and less costly than those from health food stores was from L&#x27;Oreal. I found the Kirkland SLS free shampoo by accident at Costco. This is a great product, very inexpensive, and smells very nice. L&#x27;Oreal costs about $7 for 8.5 oz product at local Target and Walmart. Kirkland is $10.00 for 33.8 oz (at Costco stores). Great deal!! Except for the pricing, I find that most SLS free shampoo give similar results. So below is my review of SLS free shampoo in general, which would apply to this Kirkland brand.  SLS free shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture away from your hair. SLS is a chemical composition found in many soapy products; it is what makes them bubbly soapy so do expect a reduction of bubbliness from this product. My experience in using SLS free shampoo is less frequency in hair washing because my scalp won&#x27;t have that yucky oily buildup (it does take a few washes before you get to this point but you will experience the difference in your hair immediately). Previously, the only shampoo I could use was Head and Shoulder. It didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp but it would have yucky oily buildup in a couple of days so I was washing my hair daily or every other day. With SLS free, I wash my hair 3-4 days and have not experience any scalp irritation. Less frequency of hair washing means that you preserve the moisture in the hair and thereby strengtens the hair strands. And, the less shampoo you would use.   I haven&#x27;t had a haircut or trim in about a year and I treat my hair with curling iron/hair straightener almost everyday. I don&#x27;t use conditioner but do treat my hair with argan oil after each shampoo. Since using SLS free I haven&#x27;t experience any damage/breakage to my hair. In fact, I receive many compliments of how healthy, shiny and smooth it looks.   The Kirkland brand is 100% vegan, no paraben and no sulfate. With the above reasons, as pricey as SLS free shampoo are... it ends up paying for itself over time. So, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo,(and the conditioner) I have coarse, thick hair and it makes it feel great. It also does a fantastic job in helping blow dry and style it. My husband likes it too and he has fine hair so guess it works for all types. Really like the way it smells.(smells good without being overly fragrant)</li>
            <li> Even with daily (or more than daily!) shampooing, my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out, and it has a great smell!  The pump dispenser is an added convenience.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. Makes my hair healthy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it here, got it at Costco and I was excited to try this for my color treated hair, etc.... BUT I find it makes my hair flat, like too silky smooth. First day was great, after a few washes felt like it left a waxie film.  Now I do have fine hair, but have never  had this problem with other products I have used/tried, whether high end or mid price.  Back to the search.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! And I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner from my local Costco. You get your money&#x27;s worth and more. I wish I knew about it a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick formula, lathers well, and moisturizes. Made my hair noticeably softer and shinier after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very, very good like one of the more expensive salon brands I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have never been disappointed with any of the Kirkland Signature products I have bought from Costco and they are of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus with this shampoo and conditioner line is it is 100% Vegan, Sulfate Free, and Paraben free. I hope they come out with more beauty products from Kirkland Signature!</li>
            <li> This shampoo bottle is big - 33.8 ounces and about 12 inches tall - so make sure your shower caddy can handle a large bottle like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SLS-free formula contains gentle cleansers and is designed to be safe for colored hair. It is also paraben free. However, I always get a little annoyed with products like this which make it sound like it&#x27;s a natural, organic product. Yes, it does contain organic extracts, such as cucumber extract, grape seed extract, avocado fruit extract, and aloe leaf extract. But look closely at the ingredients and there are a lot of chemicals with long names that show that it&#x27;s a lot like so many other shampoos out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a peachy color and quite thick in consistency.  I pumped a little bit out onto the back of my hand and it just sits there. The shampoo has a sweet, powdery scent, which is pleasant and I actually like it quite a bit.  However, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfumey scents, and prefer more natural scents, then don&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like pump bottles of shampoo for ease of use in the shower, but in this case the pump bottle was not the best choice. It&#x27;s very difficult to pump out due its thick consistency. Even my husband complained about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one full pump of the shampoo each time I wash my slightly above-the-shoulder length hair. Once I work it into my hair, the shampoo does develop a thick lather, but it takes a bit of work, and obviously, quite a bit of shampoo, to get it this point. Consequently, it seems to take quite a while to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, my hair does feel moisturized and healthy. I skip using a conditioner as it&#x27;s not necessary with this shampoo. My hair is slightly wavy with a tendency to frizz, but when I use Kirkland Moisture Shampoo, it makes the straightening process easier and I have significantly less frizz. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and I am able to shampoo my hair every other day. I think my hair color also does quite well with this shampoo and seems to not fade as quickly. 4 starsd seems to not fade as quickly. 4 stars</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo after being loyal to Pureology for a year. The cost of pureology was getting to me, so I was looking for something more reasonable. The cost of this shampoo cannot be beat. At costco, its $9.99 and its a HUGE bottle. I love the pump, i&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3+ weeks. It is not as good as Pureology, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it because of the price. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, long (lower back length), wavy hair. I wash every 2-3 days. This shampoo makes my hair feel clean, but does get greasy after day 2. (Definitely pony tail day if I go to 3). This shampoo creates a lot of buildup on my hair, making it feel heavy and greasy. This was remiedied with a clarifying shampoo after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, I&#x27;m okay with clarifying every two weeks to rid my scalp of the buildup greasyiness. The smell is strong but pleasant, and stays in my hair for the 3 full days.</li>
            <li> This really is my wife&#x27;s review. She purchased the shampoo and conditioner a bit ago after her mega-sized Biolage ran out. We love Costco and Kirkland Signature brand and can&#x27;t think of time that either of them have let us down on a purchase. Returns are easy if you don&#x27;t love it, so why not give it a shot, right? Well, she did, and demanded that this review be written. Her perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair that is going gray far too early and is obviously more coarse that her lovely auburn hair. So she colors it to hide the &amp;#34;natural highlights&amp;#34; that are covering about 50% of the hair in front and 0% of hair in back. She has fine hair, but a TON of it. Mourning the loss of her soft, healthy hair after all the processing and using what she thought was high quality stuff...she thought this is just how her hair is going to be now, but not so with this moisture shampoo! In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Loves the sulfate free and paraben free-ness :)&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing at Costco for the quality of this product&lt;br /&gt;Thick and luxurious, both the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels SOFT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hair shines like the hair of her pre-process days&lt;br /&gt;Finds she needs less of this product than other high quality shampoos, resulting in even more savings&lt;br /&gt;No buildup, no frizz and no dryness at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The only nit-picky thing she could muster is the scent isn&#x27;t her favorite, but certainly not a bad smell...just not...her fave (LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it, folks. She&#x27;s in love and can&#x27;t stop talking about this stuff. I think she is lovely as ever, regardless of the shampoo she uses or the colors she puts in or takes out of her hair, but I can attest definitely attest to increased softness of her lovely locks.</li>
            <li> I love it, it gets the job done, it&#x27;s vegan, no animal testing, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned it&#x27;s cheaper at Costco. This is true, however Costco memberships are far from free and if (like me) you don&#x27;t have one, this is still a really good deal. They last forever.</li>
            <li> I used Keune - delicate hair shampoo for over 10 years &amp; have to say it was one of the best. They don&#x27;t make it now, so I had to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shampoo a longer chance than most people. Used it for over a year. It has a nice fragrance, good consistency and works for colored hair. I noticed that my hair started thinning &amp; got greasy in 3 days. I started to shed a lot of hair too. It is thick and flattens your hair, so they look like their dirty. I&#x27;ve stopped using it now. Looking for something new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive note, it worked for my mother. It helps retain hair color for a longer time, for those who use color.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used.  Always bought very expensive shampoo from the Beauty Salon and this works better.  Has a clean fragrance.  I am unable to go to Costco and am very happy that I can buy this on line.</li>
            <li> Silicone and fine hair don&#x27;t mix. After using the shampoo and conditoner, my hair was greasy the same day.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a really strong fragrance smell (heavily perfumed) and leaves a greasy thick buildup in my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice it the first time, but after using this just a few times my hair feels GROSS. It&#x27;s like I smeared thick hand lotion evenly through my hair and let it dry. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it didn&#x27;t make me itch or cause problems.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve found!  It&#x27;s great because it actually cleans my hair, without damaging ingredients like sulfates!</li>
            <li> A very good buy, and an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Not only does it make your hair and scalp feel clean, it smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down or oily.</li>
            <li> Thought something was really wrong with me when my hair started falling out by the handfuls and my hair became brittle and knotted easily. I&#x27;ve never had knots in my hair. Stopped using this shampoo, had my hair cut a couple inches and problems have gone away. Coincidence?  I think not!</li>
            <li> Very bad scent and somewhat harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> While I like that it is gluten-free, the fragrance is VERY strong. Even when I thoroughly rinse my hair, the odor lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, it does a good job of lathering and cleaning my hair without leaving it feeling stripped or greasy. One pump is enough for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with heavy dandruff and itchy scalp for a while. After trying several dandruff and tea tree shampoos with no result, I realized the actual problem might be that they all contained sulfates and were drying out my scalp. I purchased Kirkland because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25+ only to find out it still didn&#x27;t repair my scalp. What a great surprise to find that it definitely improved my issues and I don&#x27;t need to switch up to a more costly brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on thick and the pump is slow to rise, so you&#x27;ll have to be patient with it. But it&#x27;s worth the wait. Thick, rich lather and the smell is soothing and sweet.  I do find that my hair needs to be washed more often using this, but that&#x27;s probably because my scalp is finally producing natural oils again thanks to the lack of sulfates.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling greasy and I had wash it everyday instead of every other day like I usually do. I will not be purchasing product again. :(</li>
            <li> In my never ending quest for a sulfate free shampoo that was safe for the whole family to use and upon glowing reviews from my mother-in-law, I picked up a bottle of this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago during a trip to Costco. For nine dollars a bottle (seven for the conditioner), I thought it was a great deal. The shampoo leaves hair tangle free and combined with the conditioner leaves hair super shiny, full of bounce, and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been about a month and a half and I&#x27;m noticing that (1) I have to trim my ends more often because of split ends, (2) this moisture shampoo has yet to cure my dry scalp, (3) the fragrance is one of those lingering scents that doesn&#x27;t truly wash out, and (4) I *really* don&#x27;t like the &#x27;wood glue&#x27; consistency (all the chemicals on the label are just too scary). I stopped using Loreal Evercreme because of the intensely fake vanilla smell and the high cost (thought not as much as other brands of course), however it left my hair truly moisturized, I NEVER had issues with split ends... It looks like for the time being I&#x27;m going back to Evercreme until I can transition to something better.</li>
            <li> The best gluten-free shampoo I have ever used and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this size.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, and YES this smells LIKE FOR OLD PEOPLE. It is very sweet, floral with a twinge of musk, and the smell is VERY VERY STRONG. I dont recommend it for a younger crowd.</li>
            <li> Please be advised that if you buy AT Costco it is less then half the price.  I paid 7.99 for a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a huge bottle of Kirkland \\&quot;Ultra Luxurious\\&quot; Moisture shampoo the other day at Costco and used it for the first time yesterday. The way I wash my glasses is to use the lather from my head while shampooing. I did that yesterday and it left a smeary film all over them. I also noticed yesterday evening that my hair was driving me crazy - sticking to my face and stuff like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed the glasses properly, so I tried it again this morning. Held them up to the light and they were completely covered with film. My mom bought me some of the way overpriced Wen hair care products a couple of months ago - the ones that don&#x27;t even lather. I ended up cleaning my glasses with that crap and they were cleaner than with the Kirkland stuff. After washing my hair this morning, I also had difficulty getting it to lay right. I&#x27;m going to have to give this bottle of shampoo away and buy something else; I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, my hair is very fine and very thin, with no body - this stuff just doesn&#x27;t leave it clean enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to wheat and had to find products that were gluten free.  This is very good.</li>
            <li> I wish I had waited for my next trip to Costco to get this.  I figured there would be a markup, but no idea they almost doubled the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is awesome.  Leaves hair silky smooth.  You don&#x27;t need extra since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> After extensive resesarch, I decided to purchase this item. This gluten free shampoo leaves my hair soft. Believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is gluten free and I have celiac disease.  While I love the conditioner, the shampoo is ok.  It does it&#x27;s job.  The fragrance is mild and nice, but can&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels nourished after using this and I usually don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The bottle is large so it lasts a while. I find the pump to be a bit tedious, not sure if that&#x27;s because the product itself is soo thick or if the tube is narrow. I find it hard to pump. The smell is not one of my favorite. It smells like tootsie rolls. Initially I thought mocha but I guess it more or less smells like a mix of both, loads of tootsie rolls and flavored coffee. Overall being partially organic and more natural than most shampoos I find it worth the cost and would recommend, despite the unusual smell.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at a nearby Costco and standing in the checkout line. All of a sudden, I remembered that I needed shampoo, so I told my companion to hold the pace in line while I ran to get a bottle. It was rush, grab and return. I didn&#x27;t even have time to look over the label. Well, it was Kirkland Signature and I&#x27;ve always had good luck with the brand, plus it was a nice tall bottle. I hoped I&#x27;d like it, because there was a lot of it (33.8 ounces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was excellent. Good lather, refreshing smell, seemed to work well on the rest of my body also. My hair is easy to care for and I don&#x27;t diddle around with it. This shampoo was more than enough for my needs. My hair felt good and was easy to comb (it&#x27;s about an inch long and is curly. The shampoo did a real nice job and I didn&#x27;t feel the need for a conditioner. Excellent! I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped my dandruff!!!  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really works for me I stop loosing my hair at very first wash and yes I bought it from  Costco here the price is too much</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome!! It is actually Pureology &amp; the brand name of this would be over $65/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can buy this at Costco for $8.99, but if you don&#x27;t have a membership, I guess this Amazon seller can help you out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to smell and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. My hair is super soft (I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner) and shiney!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair so oily. I love the smell but just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because i needed something that would be very moisturizing, but i found this shampoo stripped my hair of natural oils and made it even more dry and frizzy than it was before.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo to take the place of a Pureology knockoff from Sally&#x27;s that I was using and was discontinued.  I love it but I fear that it is being discontinued as well as stock is very limited and is also not available on Costco&#x27;s website when it is their product!  So bummed, what will I use now?  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Love it , Love it!! My favorite forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this shampoo and conditioner.  I have lots of very fine hair that has a nice wave to it.  My only problem is that I must color it every 3-4 weeks.  That wasn&#x27;t a problem when I could afford a salon cut and color, but now I&#x27;m forced to use the hair color products in the drugstore and they destroy my hair.  They dry my hair out so bad that it feels like straw and it sticks together.  I never had that problem with salon color.  Although I color my hair frequently, I still must be concerned about the fade factor.  So, I used Pureology shampoo.  However, that shampoo runs $50-60 for a liter and I can no longer afford it.  So, I was very happy when I found this product since it seems to be a knock-off of the Pureology.  But, does it work?  Yes, it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does not fade my hair color and it does moisturize the hair.  I shampoo daily, but I switch out my shampoos each week because I like variety.  However, this is the shampoo that I use on my hair for at least the first week after color in order to help get it back into human hair condition (I also use Wen 6-13 as an intense conditioner for 1-2 days to moisturize it).  Once my moisture has been restored, I use this shampoo and the matching conditioner.  They work great to keep my hair happy.  The only drawback that I see is the smell.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  It does kind of remind me of an old lady scent, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair, so I&#x27;ll live with it.  Another plus is that you cannot beat the price.  It&#x27;s only about $9 in Costco.  Let&#x27;s see, $9 vs. $50...guess which one I&#x27;m going to choose, even if I did still have that good job?!?!  I hated paying $50 for a liter of shampoo, so now I can use a much more affordable product that lasts for months and does the same job.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair look great the first day, but is too moisturizing. By the second day my hair is flat and greasy. I NEED to wash my hair every day with this shampoo, and after a while I noticed build-up. So now I only use it when I need a quick hair fix before I go out.</li>
            <li> Much like many others who tried this product over Pureology, I was quite disappointed. I had high hopes, but found the same problems as a few others. Its smell does not bother me and it does leave my hair soft, but I found it weighed down my hair and made it very limp. I also had to wash my hair more often because my hair would get oily fairly fast. I would perhaps recommend this to somebody with very dry hair, but otherwise it weighed down the hair too much and made it too greasy. Was hoping for a better product. I now have an entire bottle sitting in my shower and I feel too bad about throwing an entire 33.8 oz bottle out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many organic shampoo&#x27;s in the market and this&lt;br /&gt;one is the best out of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most organic shampoos it cleans hair thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Has very nice and light smell (not too intrusive).&lt;br /&gt;Most important of all no harmful chemicals!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in late 2012 and I still have some left. It lathers very well and cleanses the scalp very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The first week of using this shampoo and conditioner my hair felt great, very soft and looked shiny. I wash my hair about every other day or every two days, but 2 weeks into using this product and I find myself having to wash my hair more frequently. My scalp tends to get very oily much faster and it looks a lot more limp and without volume. Previous to using this I used a bunch of different shampoos (garnier, dove, treseme) and I also used to be able to use dry shampoo without adding build up but with this product I have not been able to, my hair is just too oily and there is too much build up for it to handle a dry shampoo. However, I really like the way my hair feels and looks the first day after using it so I will probably just stick with it and use a clarifying shampoo once a week (I recommend a tea tree product). By the way the product is much cheaper at Costco @ $7.99 and $8.99</li>
            <li> Okay, I have extensive experience in the salon and spa industry, and was in education, management and sales for a major distributorship of professional salon products including everything from Aveda to Schwarzkopf and everything in between.  This is seriously great stuff.  I can&#x27;t even think of a salon product in recent memory that I have liked as much as I like this.  The shampoo leaves your hair smooth, frizz free, shiny, healthy, soft, and protected from any heat styling you will do.  I color at least once a month, and my hair feels fantastic after using this.  I have used it even on the baby fine hair of my two year old, as well as the coarse, curly hair of my 12 year old- great results with everyone.  I like the scent.  It&#x27;s a bit flowery, but nothing over the top.  I think it&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;d pay twice this amount at least.  Love it.  Best product purchase in years.</li>
            <li> Recently went to Costco and bought this shampoo for $9/33 oz. It has a wonderful, mild vanilla scent and is very thick and creamy. I don&#x27;t have to use much because it lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped/stringey/over washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has everything that I expect from a shampoo- gf, vegan, paraben/sulfate free, inexpensive, and it works well. I have very thick, course, and kinky hair. I notice that it IS more moisturized and glossy when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I borrowed my daughter&#x27;s bottle when staying with her and loved it. Sadly, I live 80 miles from the nearest Costco but Amazon came to the rescue. As Amazon can attest from my order history,  a bottle lasts at least five to six months and I shampoo every morning.  I don&#x27;t need conditioner and I love the scent of the shampoo.  I will also add that I am allergic to dozens of hair and skin products and Kirkland Signature doesn&#x27;t trigger any of them.</li>
            <li> Washes hair well but it is so strongly perfumed that you stink of it for days. Someone was not thinking straight while deciding formulation ratios in this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when at Costco based on the reviews here. The price is great and seems to do a good job with my hair however the smell is so strong and perfumey I just can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells however this shampoo/conditioner smells stronger than any other I have used.  Had it not been for the strong smell it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, nothing bad and nothing good. Just typical shampoo. It&#x27;s a little heavy, so it weighed my hair down.. But its not awful.</li>
            <li> shampoo is cost effective for sure.  i think it&#x27;s like $8 if you get it at a costco warehouse (membership required).  personally didnt like it.  smelled like butter scotch.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos that contain sulfates, but it has decent lather. The smell is pretty stong, it&#x27;s a good smell, but sweet. This is one shampoo that lingers for 24+ hrs, so your hair will always smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing to remember is to use the normal amount of shampoo, but use less than half of your normal amount of conditioner. I usually use 2-2.5 pumps of conditioner for my shoulder length hair, but I use only half a pump of Kirkland. If you use more, it will really weigh down your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my over-highlighted hair smooth, shiny, and manageable. I don&#x27;t even need to use a hair straighter to tame the frizzies!  Best of all, both the shampoo &amp; conditioner are GLUTEN free!!  I&#x27;m so grateful they make this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Kirkland Moisture conditioner for months, but just ran out of my salon shampoo and decided to try this. Big mistake. It is filled with silicone based ingredients that make my hair look greasy and flat after maybe 12 hours.  I like to shampoo every other day because my hair is color treated and excessive washing wears down your color. But with this shampoo you will look dirty and unkempt if you don&#x27;t wash immediately after. Terrible.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks but it makes it fall out by the handfuls. I have never had my hair fall out until I started using this shampoo and conditioner. I am not going to use it anymore. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Not great for my fine hair but my fiancé loves it</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo minus the scent. When I was pregnant it  made me gag. Note it is just too perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is luxurious yet unpretentious. With its lavender and chocolate color swirled with iridescence to the thick and dense foamy lather, if oozes higher quality. I love the smell, not flowery, powdery or perfumey at all. It&#x27;s almost like bergamont or Earl Grey tea and cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle isn&#x27;t exactly the prettiest thing in my shower but it also doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;lady product\\&quot; and scare away my man from using it. The bottle is huge and the pump is great, distributing just enough for my past the shoulders hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about it is that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like anything but - my hair. Healthy. No residue, no weighing it down, no drying it out, just healthy natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my hair type first, therefore those with similar hair types can stay away from this product. My hair is long (middle back) medium texture, color treated once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Many people rave about this product due to the AMOUNT of product you get for the price however this shampoo literally STRIPS all the natural oils from your hair leaving it dry and frizzy. I know there are many who have excess oil in their hair and want to get rid of their oily scalp however i suggest you find a different product. Many reviews state that this shampoo causes more buildup after a few washes of use. I am very disappointed that it drys out my hair. The only pro i have for this is that you get a lot of product for the price however it is not worth the drying frizzy feeling it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s reach, smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
