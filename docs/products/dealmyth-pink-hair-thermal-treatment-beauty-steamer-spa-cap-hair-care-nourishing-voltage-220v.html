            <li>Product is excellent and seller is A plus !</li>
            <li>The item is good at that price, I use it every day</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t even get warm let alone</li>
            <li>Stores nicely because it can be folded.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know this information beforehand, now I have no idea how to even use it.</li>
            <li>Love this hair heat cap.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I have used heating caps that heat to process color or speed up the bleach process which requires much more heat.  </li>
            <li>My advice would be invest the money for a better steam/thermal product.</li>
            <li>it fits nicely on my daughters head and doesnt get too hot that it bothers her.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li>it really works!!!</li>
            <li>I thought about returning it and just never got around to doing it; I think it was a good investment and may prove to be useful in the future.  </li>
            <li>Durable product, excellent arrival time, in my opinion the only drawback is the thermal heat does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The cap is lined in a moderate plastic so that you can use with or without your own plastic cap.  </li>
            <li>hot.</li>
            <li>The heat isn&#x27;t strong enough to create steam.</li>
            <li>This thermal steamer cap has an adjustable strap to assure a proper fit.</li>
            <li>Poor fit, doesn&#x27;t get warm</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot at all and the instructions came in Chinese.</li>
            <li>This cap I purchased for hair conditioning, I felt it did not get hot enough to perform the job.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was it was delivered earlier than expected and the company contacted me from China or Taiwan, which I initially thought was some scam message, so I deleted.</li>
            <li>Then there are caps used for hair conditioning but must get hot enough to open the hair cuticle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and it left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>As far as heat and steam it does not give enough of either.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that all of the instructions are written in Chinese and feel that the manufacturer should take the extra step of translating the product information in order to offer it in the American marketplace.</li>

            <li> The item is good at that price, I use it every day but It should be warmer than it is. Voltage needs to be increased.</li>
            <li> Item sucks. No directions, Words were written in Chinese. Plus it doesn&#x27;t even get warm let alone hot. I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Poor fit, doesn&#x27;t get warm</li>
            <li> The heat isn&#x27;t strong enough to create steam. I just ended up with a head cold.</li>
            <li> This was an impulsive purchase for me and I have not had the opportunity to use it yet.  I thought about returning it and just never got around to doing it; I think it was a good investment and may prove to be useful in the future.  I was surprised that all of the instructions are written in Chinese and feel that the manufacturer should take the extra step of translating the product information in order to offer it in the American marketplace.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot at all and the instructions came in Chinese.</li>

            <li> I love it...it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. It does not heat up and it is useless....it now goes in the trash where it belongs.</li>
            <li> The product came all written in an Asian Language with ho English version. Did not heat up well. Only heats up on the side. Although I managed to figure out how to operate the product it is no good. Would not recommend. The only good thing was it was delivered earlier than expected and the company contacted me from China or Taiwan, which I initially thought was some scam message, so I deleted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and it left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Durable product, excellent arrival time, in my opinion the only drawback is the thermal heat does not get hot enough.  I have used heating caps that heat to process color or speed up the bleach process which requires much more heat.  Then there are caps used for hair conditioning but must get hot enough to open the hair cuticle.  This cap I purchased for hair conditioning, I felt it did not get hot enough to perform the job.</li>
            <li> Did not work! no heat at all! so sad</li>
            <li> Just received product in the mail, within the dates it said it would arrive. It doesn&#x27;t come in a box just plastic &amp; the directions are in Chinese, there is no English version. It would have been nice to know this information beforehand, now I have no idea how to even use it. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Not what I expected I am really sad it doesn&#x27;t get hot and i need it right now :( . I will return it</li>
            <li> The instructions were not in English.</li>
            <li> This thermal steamer cap has an adjustable strap to assure a proper fit.The cap is lined in a moderate plastic so that you can use with or without your own plastic cap.  As far as heat and steam it does not give enough of either. My advice would be invest the money for a better steam/thermal product. I will probably purchase one that is similar to the one in a hair salon. It will do for the moment but, not what I had hoped for. Save your money</li>
            <li> product was what i expected</li>
