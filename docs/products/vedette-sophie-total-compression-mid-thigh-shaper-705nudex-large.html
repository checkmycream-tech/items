    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I mention that the bottom of the awesome waist compression stops at my belly button?  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprise at how comfy it is.  </li>
            <li>It is well built, and the best girdle I own.</li>
            <li>and it feels great</li>
            <li>It has been a great help and awesome fit</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly and I was impressed by that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got convinced by the good reviews and ordered one.</li>
            <li>It came on time, the material is really good.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good, the product is well made but there is no way this is US or EU size.</li>
            <li>but no it&#x27;s just perfect and comfortable ...</li>
            <li>length is good</li>
            <li>Once I was finally able to get it on, it felt great.</li>
            <li>now how I look with my favorite dress!</li>
            <li>and it held everything in place nicely.  </li>
            <li>I liked it ...</li>
            <li>So worth it!!!</li>
            <li>awesome compression of the waist would be far more awesome if it extended to the hips, as that would flatten the pooch (thanks for that, kids) &amp; avoid any possibility of hip</li>
            <li>Very comfortable medium compression</li>
            <li>I am size 12 on the bottom and 10 on the top, so I ordered an XL.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to fit</li>
            <li>, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I think I may even be able use it to run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Spanx for years and my favorite feature is the &#x27;pee hole&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It gave me the support where I needed it the most (waist &amp; hips).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-everything is nice &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS TO SOME ONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR MUFFIN TOP CONTROL BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT PROVIDE IT.</li>
            <li>I found the best way to get it on was to fold the top down at the point where the legs meet, pull on the legs, gather each leg up, then position them correctly, then start wriggling the top up.  </li>
            <li>The description on the size should be more detailed.</li>
            <li>IT WAS GOING TO SMOOTH OUT MY MUFFIN TOP</li>
            <li>Love the fit of this garment, I order this garment for my Brazilian Butt Lift surgery and it fits great in a size xl, but wish I had went a size smaller for more pressure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 195 but for someone that just want a little more curve control under their clothes this is perfect for you in a xl.</li>
            <li>But I got it and could not even fit into the thing.</li>
            <li>and I hope the process for a refund goes smoothly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just how secure it</li>
            <li>I will say that it is a real trip trying to get this on, but after some creative moves was able to get in up and on.</li>
            <li>Gave me one hell of a laugh!</li>
            <li>I purchased others since it was for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this shaper, I decided to get an extra-large to be on the safe side, as I just wanted some gentle shaping (let&#x27;s be real, everyone has fat pockets where they don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li>Granted its a task to get into any corsette, but my finger went right through the nylon as i pulled it on.</li>
            <li>It was not the right color I wanted and it had a hole in the leg.  </li>
            <li>It compresses, and offers a smooth shape.</li>
            <li>I broke several of my nails trying to make it fit.</li>
            <li>Was very worried about breaking a nail while I wrenched it on.</li>
            <li>BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in a size up like most of the other comments suggested.</li>
            <li>I tend to wear large in most clothes, X-L in clothes that run small.</li>
            <li>I bought the size I would normally buy but in reality instead of a extra large you should order a 1x or 2x if you want it to fit properly</li>
            <li>I think because my stomach hangs a bit normally, and this pushes it up, and thus out, there just isn&#x27;t a benefit to my profile while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I tried on my size large Halloween costume without this on last night and with it on tonight, and really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>It does the job everywhere but on the tight the nylon tore easily as I was trying it on.</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 different body shapers, the other 2 fit fine, this one not true to size at all..</li>
            <li>I literally have no idea how it would even conceivably go up.</li>
            <li>NOTHING TO MAKE YOU SAY WOW ...</li>
            <li>can barely get the XL onto my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to stand wearing it long enough to last the day (it&#x27;s for my wedding).</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Was difficult to put on, but then again I should really be in the large or even extra large size.</li>
            <li>think the only issue I had was the bra area was not wide enough.</li>
            <li>I purchased an EXTRA LARGE and it looked like it was made for a girl half my size.</li>
            <li>I am actually a size large, down from a size 2X last year.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed &amp; glad</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too small.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a XL and it looks like a small.</li>
            <li> Reading all these reviews about people getting it too small ..</li>
            <li> opening isn&#x27;t too small, nor does it take up any leg space</li>
            <li> AND THAT&#x27;S THAT I ORDERED A SMALL</li>
            <li> I figured it would be tough to get on since other people mentioned it.</li>
            <li> But oh my gosh its ridiculous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shaper is a nightmare to wear and take off. I got convinced by the good reviews and ordered one. It came on time, the material is really good. However, the maker forgot one detail: How are we supposed to get in and out of it. I am size 12 on the bottom and 10 on the top, so I ordered an XL. Still the shaper got stuck beneath my bottom and would not pull up no matter how much I stretched it. My husband tried to help me and still we could not get it on. I broke several of my nails trying to make it fit. I am returning the shaper and would DEFINITELY NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is well built, and the best girdle I own. The others are both from Walmart though, and have eye and hook closures, which tend to come apart on stretched material. It compresses, and offers a smooth shape. I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; 185 pounds and bought the medium, not because I am a medium, but because I want to be a medium. I am actually a size large, down from a size 2X last year. It did not make me a medium (if it did I would give it 10 billion stars). I tried on my size large Halloween costume without this on last night and with it on tonight, and really don&#x27;t see a difference. I think because my stomach hangs a bit normally, and this pushes it up, and thus out, there just isn&#x27;t a benefit to my profile while wearing it. I like the compression, but in my case with my body type there is no benefit to my profile while wearing this. Well made for what it is. Was difficult to put on, but then again I should really be in the large or even extra large size.</li>
            <li> It has been a great help and awesome fit and it feels great .&lt;br /&gt;Love now how I look with my favorite dress!</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 different body shapers, the other 2 fit fine, this one not true to size at all.. Very disappointed &amp; glad I purchased others since it was for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly and I was impressed by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I put it on, it was hard getting it past my hips.  I honestly thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to fit but it did and it held everything in place nicely.  It was easier to put on during my future uses but it does not open or close for bathroom access.  I actually have to remove the entire thing to use the restroom which is a pain.  Other than that, I love the product.</li>
            <li> It does the job everywhere but on the tight the nylon tore easily as I was trying it on. Granted its a task to get into any corsette, but my finger went right through the nylon as i pulled it on.</li>
            <li> I got this to wear under my outfit for a convention party that I will be going to. I will say that it is a real trip trying to get this on, but after some creative moves was able to get in up and on. It holds everything in like it says.</li>
            <li> It was not the right color I wanted and it had a hole in the leg.  I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> I got it, opened the package and it&#x27;s too small.  I have no idea how to return it. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the fit of this garment, I order this garment for my Brazilian Butt Lift surgery and it fits great in a size xl, but wish I had went a size smaller for more pressure I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 195 but for someone that just want a little more curve control under their clothes this is perfect for you in a xl.</li>
            <li> I am not a terribly big girl. I tend to wear large in most clothes, X-L in clothes that run small. When I purchased this item, I expected it to maybe even be too big. But I got it and could not even fit into the thing. I purchased an EXTRA LARGE and it looked like it was made for a girl half my size. I understand that compression clothes are meant to be tight---- they have to be in order to do their job. But if I can&#x27;t actually get the thing on, that&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> The size of this product is Asian size. The packaging was good, the product is well made but there is no way this is US or EU size. I ordered a XL and it looks like a small. I am returning it and I hope the process for a refund goes smoothly. The description on the size should be more detailed. I did not see measurements.</li>
            <li> This body shaper is so small that expected, only make me so sad about it, i can&#x27;t think about small size...</li>
            <li> Once I was finally able to get it on, it felt great. I think I may even be able use it to run. That&#x27;s just how secure it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bathroom issue, #1, was no problem. I didn&#x27;t try #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straps were removable, so I changed mine to clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only issue I had was the bra area was not wide enough.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable medium compression</li>
            <li> if you have to be this skinny to wear one of these, you don&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause it cost less than half what the Spanx version cost. I&#x27;ve been using Spanx for years and my favorite feature is the &#x27;pee hole&#x27;. The Vedette 705 has a pee hole! YAY!! It also has extra support on the rear end, so curvy girls like me don&#x27;t have to worry about it flattening our booty! So worth it!!! A bit of a pain putting it on, but then again, what body shaper isn&#x27;t a pain putting on?!?!</li>
            <li> Buy like two sizes above your regular dress size for it to even fit.ridiculous!!!&lt;br /&gt;i do n0t recommend buying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly overweight and this body shaper made my back rolls disappear. It gave me the support where I needed it the most (waist &amp; hips).  I was very pleasantly surprise at how comfy it is.  My only negative is the straps in front cut into you.  They need to be either widened or padded. Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a size medium, with a tall and slender frame. After reading the reviews for this shaper, I decided to get an extra-large to be on the safe side, as I just wanted some gentle shaping (let&#x27;s be real, everyone has fat pockets where they don&#x27;t want them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can barely get the XL onto my body. Was very worried about breaking a nail while I wrenched it on. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to stand wearing it long enough to last the day (it&#x27;s for my wedding). The shaper definitely shapes, it&#x27;s just too small -- unnecessarily so.</li>
            <li> I liked it ... Reading all these reviews about people getting it too small .. Made me order a size bigger. I expected it to be tighter but no it&#x27;s just perfect and comfortable ... I forget I have it on</li>
            <li> To give you an idea as to sizing, I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;, my waist is 35&amp;#34;, &amp; my hips are 49&amp;#34;.  I wear size 16 pants, 14 dress.  I went by measurements and ordered an XL.  This took about 15 minutes &amp; several tries to get on, and no way would I ever want anyone to witness the process.  I found the best way to get it on was to fold the top down at the point where the legs meet, pull on the legs, gather each leg up, then position them correctly, then start wriggling the top up.  That part looks pretty grotesque and is reason enough to go on a diet.  Now that it&#x27;s on, I might contemplate showering in it &amp; being fitted with a colostomy bag in order to avoid the process again (kidding of coursem but I&#x27;m not looking forward to the struggle).  After getting it on, my waist was 34&amp;#34;  &amp; my hips were 48.5&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-great waist compression&lt;br /&gt;-decent hip compression&lt;br /&gt;-everything is nice &amp; smooth&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t look like I have 1 butt cheek&lt;br /&gt;-I can breathe&lt;br /&gt;-leg length is good&lt;br /&gt;-torso length could be shorter or longer&lt;br /&gt;-gusset opening isn&#x27;t too small, nor does it take up any leg space&lt;br /&gt;-long straps, so my girls aren&#x27;t smooshed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the awesome compression of the waist would be far more awesome if it extended to the hips, as that would flatten the pooch (thanks for that, kids) &amp; avoid any possibility of hip doughnut.&lt;br /&gt;-unless I get a colostomy bag, I will have to take this off to poop... If that happens in public, this thing will go in my purse, as there&#x27;s no way I could get it back on in a bathroom stall without someone calling 911 in an attempt to rescue me from my attacker.&lt;br /&gt;-did I mention that the bottom of the awesome waist compression stops at my belly button?  Yeah.  That too.</li>
            <li> I bought the size I would normally buy but in reality instead of a extra large you should order a 1x or 2x if you want it to fit properly</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh...Im hysterical right now. I ordered this in a size up like most of the other comments suggested. I figured it would be tough to get on since other people mentioned it. But oh my gosh its ridiculous. I could get it about halfway up my thighs and that was it. I literally have no idea how it would even conceivably go up. And thats ordering an XL even though my measurements on the size chart would be an L. Gave me one hell of a laugh!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS GOING TO SMOOTH OUT MY MUFFIN TOP BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. IT FEELS KINDA TIGHT BUT I DON&#x27;T FEEL ENOUGH COMPRESSION AND THAT&#x27;S THAT I ORDERED A SMALL AND I WEIGHT 130 LBS. YOU CAN NOTICE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHEN I&#x27;M WEARING THE BODY SHAPER BUT NOTHING TO MAKE YOU SAY WOW ... OVERALL I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS TO SOME ONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR MUFFIN TOP CONTROL BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT PROVIDE IT.</li>
