            <li>I LIKE TO DO MY OWN NAILS</li>
            <li>, i loved having this one, i felt my nails stayed better looking longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give an update when I use it more, but great first impression!!</li>
            <li>I liked it even more because of the price on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>and it keeps your nails very strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I paired it with Out the Door top coat</li>
            <li>this one is much better.</li>
            <li>MOST OF THE TIME</li>
            <li>so I will give this more time to make a more educated decision.</li>
            <li>Protects nails from discoloration better than others I have used (Orly Bonder, OPI)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>A couple more uses of this has helped repair them again.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so it makes whatever color you wear on top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already started using Nailtiques on them to try to make them healthy again, as well as started to take a biotin vitamin supplement.</li>
            <li>Nailtiques on them to try to make them healthy again, as well as started to take a biotin vitamin supplement.</li>
            <li>The fragrance dissipates almost immediately, so you&#x27;re not overwhelmed with a lot of strong odors.  </li>
            <li>It makes your manicure look clean and smooth whether you are putting a color on top of it or not.</li>
            <li>like it fine,</li>
            <li>but this makes your mani last longer and makes the color more bright and fuller.</li>
            <li>all the brands seem to remain chip free longer.  </li>
            <li>It lasted three days chip free</li>
            <li>I felt compelled to write this review based on my bizarre experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my nails all the time, they are long, healthy, strong and beautiful for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier</li>
            <li>I would pay twice as much as I did for this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very important new HG product for my weekly home manicure :)</li>
            <li>but it really made them feel healthy and strong</li>
            <li>THANKS ESSIE! :)</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it makes your nails feel stronger, and if you just want a shiny coat on your bare nail bed it makes a good polish by itself.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>my nails feel healthier and harder than they&#x27;ve ever been and it even looks good w/o any polish on top.</li>
            <li>I have never, ever had long healthy nails in my life!!</li>
            <li>recommend this highly if you want to keep you nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I JUST DO ONE COAT WITH THE HELP OF ESSIE&#x27;S FAST DRYING TOP COAT</li>
            <li>It dries smoothly so that putting polish over it glides on just right.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always been pretty strong</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPNG WAS QUICK</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Essie polish customer.</li>
            <li>My nails used to be fabulously strong, but I guess I started painting them too much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve become kind of fragile.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on the nails, u have to use not so much, it helps the nails, the only thing what should be better is the drytime</li>
            <li>It is helping my natural nails stay strong and grow out.  </li>
            <li>Seller ships fast!</li>
            <li>Looking for a good one without the harsh and harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, protects my nails from discoloration from colored polish, and makes other coats glide on super smooth.</li>
            <li>good quality base, apply before colors and will keep your nails hydrated and give a nice protective and smooth layer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly, with a bit of a white tint to it, which I like well enough because you can make sure you&#x27;ve covered the whole nail.  </li>
            <li>My nails are back to normal and look extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>The vibrancy of their colors can not be matched, There quality is far better than any other polish I have ever used, and my nails are healthier and stronger all of which I give full credit to Essie.</li>
            <li>During winter time when I tend to use very dark polishes and keep up my manicure often (I like to see nice nails when gloves are taken off...</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really know if it improved my nails all that much.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something to help strengthen my nails as they are very brittle.</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep nails from absorbing polish colors.</li>
            <li>They felt much stronger.</li>
            <li>This stuff really delivers.....</li>
            <li>no matter how much you prep them.</li>
            <li>makes a great base or can look nice alone.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes a nice semi-translucent polish if you wear it by itself but as a base coat I am not too impressed.</li>
            <li>The other brand I had was okay</li>
            <li>As my nails grow out, they continue to peel in half, as in, peeling a top layer of nail off - leaving a flimsy, half-thickness nail in its place.</li>
            <li>but I bought it too late; my nails were already becoming brittle and starting to flake at the tips from too many nail polish applications and removals.  </li>
            <li>My nails are nice and hard.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice and thick</li>
            <li>I started searching for a new nail strengthener, as I had not had any luck with the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and this one came highly recommended all around the web.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only 4 of my 10 nails even look normal right now.</li>
            <li>and it seems to make the manicure remain free from chips longer than the other products too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Essie but bought this when I bought a new polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already knew I liked it because it has done wonders for my weak, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for my nails to heal until I go back to painting them again, but I will certainly be putting on this as a coat beforehand, and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the hard as hell nails on top of it?</li>
            <li>you can wear it as clear polish and not paint your nails</li>
            <li>BY ESSIE IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>Also, this is the first time in a long time that my nails themselves aren&#x27;t flaking.</li>
            <li>If you want to protect your nails from your colored nail polish, apply a coat of this and the nail is completely covered and protected.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try a gel manicure but had read that they can completely wreck your nails.  </li>
            <li>It chips really easily near your nail beds</li>
            <li>I have used this product regularly and I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in the strength or growth.</li>
            <li>Changing from 2 starts to 1 - Stay FAR AWAY from this product...</li>
            <li>Changing from 2 starts to 1 - Stay FAR AWAY from this product...</li>
            <li>I started doing my own nails a few months ago, and this polish is a great base coat.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
            <li>but I love this as the bottom coat because it doesn&#x27;t leave my nails with a yellow tint especially after I use a black nail polish.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it as a top coat, since it is slightly opaque and won&#x27;t go on perfectly clear over other colors.  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty rough with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many base coats and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>At least my nails stay strong.</li>
            <li>Goes on first, keeps my nails from turning yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Not too expensive and easy to apply</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and it is not clear, so it creates a good base for sheer nail colors.  </li>
            <li>I really love this base coat it made my nails smooth and soft, it helped to prevent the nail polish from staining</li>
            <li>but this base coat is awesome in terms of how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>and I am going on day 5 with one tiny chip that is barely noticeable.</li>

            <li> THIS NAIL BASE COAT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this base and this vendor to anyone looking for an expensive product at a great price (with free shipping).</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough--</li>
            <li> I think their colors are the prettiest and quite long lasting.</li>
            <li> and when I took it off my nails did look a little worse, but not terribly so.  </li>
            <li> My nails always chip and break when I let them get long</li>
            <li> just be prepared that it is not clear but opaque or milky.  </li>
            <li> I now have the base coat and a clear top coat so they can recover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely made a difference and the slightly opaque color</li>
            <li> If i leave my manicure on for too long, I usually have a yellow nail dilemma - this works wonders at protecting my nail and giving it life.</li>
            <li> I have removed it from my nails and after a few days will go back to OPI.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected from an Essie product</li>
            <li> This is the only none drugstore base coat I have tried on my nails, I have been using it for more than a year</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it&#x27;s my favorite nail base.</li>
            <li> This protein Base is really strong, I seen Results Instantly!!</li>
            <li> But whether I leave this one for 2-3 days or I put new on every night my nails flake worse then if I use nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I will update as to whether it keeps my nails healthy, but so far this will be my go to base coat...!    </li>
            <li> i love the seche top coat, but was disappointed in its base coat.</li>
            <li> to purchase a base coat that is better.</li>
            <li> Base coat works ok but improperly decribed on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There will never be another base coat in my polish bin :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely due to damage caused by the FORMALDEHYDE in this product!</li>
            <li> It also works really well as a base coat especially because it is not absolutely clear its translucent</li>
            <li> There is still some amount of breakage, but it does seem to be less.  </li>
            <li> Well, when I started using it, I found that in only a few weeks (like, two or even less), my nails really dried out, got hard as rocks, and started splitting on the sides.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN JUST TELL WHEN UR PUTTING ON YOUR NAIL COLOR AFTER YOU&#x27;VE PUT THE BASE COAT, IT GOES ON SO EASY AND STAYS IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and I can&#x27;t imagine applying color without first using this base coat.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just my bad luck with the damage to them, but seriously, within just a few days of each other, they ALL split on the sides and some even totally ripped off to the fingertip because they&#x27;d split on BOTH sides of the nail.</li>
            <li> i use to rock just this on my nails, its a little milky look</li>
            <li> I buy all their products and have never been let down!</li>
            <li> I was being ridiculous about them causing my nails to dry out and break.</li>
            <li> I love that this base coat really protects my nails and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like OPI base coats I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I thought this base coat would help keep my nails from chipping so quickly, however, it did not.</li>
            <li> One application of this base coat has my natural nails back in tip-top shape.  </li>
            <li> did two base coats because I wanted to, two layers of an OPI polish and finished it off with a quick drying topcoat from BUTTER.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to tell you - it&#x27;s been just shy or two weeks of using it again after a 3 month hiatus and EIGHT of my nails are split on the sides again, as well as three of them actually peeling in half at the tip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other base coats that didn&#x27;t really make a difference, but for some reason this makes it so you&#x27;re in control of your nails instead of worrying about chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear gel polish,but every once in awhile I like to take a break from the gels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flash to this past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that this base coat did any sort of nail &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Usually I would have already redone my nails!</li>
            <li> For some reason whenever I use a black nail polish my nails have a slight yellow tint (doesn&#x27;t matter if it is store brand or expensive brand, and doesn&#x27;t matter of the base coat either).</li>
            <li> Been using this protein base coat for weeks now below my regular color polish...</li>
            <li> When I got this base coat, my nails were fragile &amp; peeling because I picked off the gel polish I was wearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using another base coat but decided to go back to this one just in case</li>
            <li> So as far as this base coat goes... RUN AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> other base coats - BUT - Essie refunded my money when I sent a note via their customer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average base coat.</li>
            <li> The previous base coat I used was Seche rebuild, and I couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea WTF is in this stuff, but I&#x27;ve never, ever had this happen.</li>
            <li> My nails were experiencing crazy breakage</li>
            <li> This base coat however makes my nails stronger and keeps them without than nasty yellow</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, seemed like polish chipped worse than without base coat or as compared to</li>
            <li> With this base coat, my polish lasts until I get sick of it--at least a week.  </li>
            <li> Now I can wear this base coat and not have to worry about weak nails!  </li>
            <li> so I invested in this protein base coat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this base coat under my polish for about a month now.</li>
            <li> This has not happend before when I was using the OPI as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> So I am thinking it must be the formaldehyde in the Essie base coat.  </li>
            <li> I already had a base coat by Essie, but when I came across the protein base coat I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I thought base coats prevent nail staining</li>
            <li> My nails were reinforced when wearing this base coat.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an Essie base coat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this base coat, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Always use this one as a base.</li>
            <li> I highlight recommend this to use as a base coat on your nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this base coat because a you-tube video blogger always painted her nails and mentioned she used this as a base</li>
            <li> I am an exclusive Essie polish user, so I thought I&#x27;d try this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> Essie&#x27;s protein base coat does the job well.</li>
            <li> ive bought base coats before and thought they were a scam</li>
            <li> not at all bad though!</li>
            <li> My nails looked HORRIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li> It was like I had acrylics on, but they felt awful.</li>

            <li> I thought this base coat would help keep my nails from chipping so quickly, however, it did not. It&#x27;s just your average base coat. Goes on nice and thick but I don&#x27;t really know if it improved my nails all that much.</li>
            <li> My nails were experiencing crazy breakage so I invested in this protein base coat. I&#x27;ve only used it in about 5 manis or so but it seems to be combating breakage for my nails however I can&#x27;t necessarily say it has made my nails stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND Stickey with Seche Vite. I switched to Essie because my nails were drying and peeling from the CND Stickey. I can&#x27;t speak to how well they treat my nails but this base coat is awesome in terms of how long it lasts. I paired it with Out the Door top coat and I am going on day 5 with one tiny chip that is barely noticeable. I have used Seche Vite and NailTek base coats which chipped immediately, but this stuff is great. I will update as to whether it keeps my nails healthy, but so far this will be my go to base coat...!    Update: I have been using this base coat under my polish for about a month now. My nails are back to normal and look extremely healthy. There isn&#x27;t any peeling, redness or dryness. I would pay twice as much as I did for this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> THIS NAIL BASE COAT IS AMAZING! THE SHIPPNG WAS QUICK AND I LIKE HOW THE NAIL POLISH APPLIES AFTER JUST ONE COAT.</li>
            <li> i love the seche top coat, but was disappointed in its base coat. this one is much better. it definitely strengthens my nails and prevents chipping.</li>
            <li> This protein Base is really strong, I seen Results Instantly!!, I Only put it on once and my nails are way healthier. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This product goes on really well and prevents staining from dark nail polishes and my nails feel harder and healthier already after 2 uses</li>
            <li> but it does the job and does the job well...just be prepared that it is not clear but opaque or milky.  not at all bad though!</li>
            <li> I LIKE TO DO MY OWN NAILS BECAUSE I LIKE TO CHANGE THEM OFTEN AND DON&#x27;T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET THEM PROFESSIONALY DONE. I&#x27;VE LITERALLY TRIED ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF BASECOATS AND THIS PROTEIN BASECOAT BY ESSIE IS BY FAR THE BEST! YOU CAN JUST TELL WHEN UR PUTTING ON YOUR NAIL COLOR AFTER YOU&#x27;VE PUT THE BASE COAT, IT GOES ON SO EASY AND STAYS IN PLACE. MOST OF THE TIME I JUST DO ONE COAT WITH THE HELP OF ESSIE&#x27;S FAST DRYING TOP COAT \\&quot;GOOD TO GO.\\&quot; I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY I FOUND THIS. THANKS ESSIE! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;m used to my polish lasting about 2 days without chipping.  With this base coat, my polish lasts until I get sick of it--at least a week.  I&#x27;ve used other base coats that didn&#x27;t really make a difference, but for some reason this makes it so you&#x27;re in control of your nails instead of worrying about chipping or peeling.  As a bonus, it makes your nails feel stronger, and if you just want a shiny coat on your bare nail bed it makes a good polish by itself.  Just don&#x27;t use it as a top coat, since it is slightly opaque and won&#x27;t go on perfectly clear over other colors.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I guess it does what it is supposed to.  I trust Essie products so I will give this more time to make a more educated decision.</li>
            <li> Been using this protein base coat for weeks now below my regular color polish... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried something as good... my nails feel healthier and harder than they&#x27;ve ever been and it even looks good w/o any polish on top. Definitely recommended...</li>
            <li> i use to rock just this on my nails, its a little milky look but it really made them feel healthy and strong, i loved having this one, i felt my nails stayed better looking longer</li>
            <li> Going on day 5 and I&#x27;m just starting to notice chipping. Usually I would have already redone my nails! I might actually change my nail polish just to change the color, and not because it&#x27;s chipping. That&#x27;s a first! Also, this is the first time in a long time that my nails themselves aren&#x27;t flaking. I&#x27;ll give an update when I use it more, but great first impression!!</li>
            <li> Others have stated some of the benefits.  I have tried many base coats and this is my favorite so far.  Protects nails from discoloration better than others I have used (Orly Bonder, OPI) and it seems to make the manicure remain free from chips longer than the other products too.  I have used this with several brands of polish (Essie, OPI, Wet n Wild, Sally Hansen) and all the brands seem to remain chip free longer.  I should add that I always use a coat of Seche Vite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-- After several weeks of use my nails are turning yellow.  This has not happend before when I was using the OPI as a base coat.  So I am thinking it must be the formaldehyde in the Essie base coat.  I have removed it from my nails and after a few days will go back to OPI.  Will not use the Essie again.</li>
            <li> If you want to protect your nails from your colored nail polish, apply a coat of this and the nail is completely covered and protected.  This is my second bottle, and I can&#x27;t imagine applying color without first using this base coat.  The fragrance dissipates almost immediately, so you&#x27;re not overwhelmed with a lot of strong odors.  I would recommend this base and this vendor to anyone looking for an expensive product at a great price (with free shipping).</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something to help strengthen my nails as they are very brittle. But whether I leave this one for 2-3 days or I put new on every night my nails flake worse then if I use nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I already had a base coat by Essie, but when I came across the protein base coat I had to buy it. I love it, my nails are growing faster then before, it&#x27;s a great fast drying (as always with Essie products) base coat! Seller ships fast! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My nails used to be fabulously strong, but I guess I started painting them too much and they&#x27;ve become kind of fragile.  I wanted to try a gel manicure but had read that they can completely wreck your nails.  I started searching for a new nail strengthener, as I had not had any luck with the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and this one came highly recommended all around the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely made a difference and the slightly opaque color makes a great base or can look nice alone.  There is still some amount of breakage, but it does seem to be less.  I did end up getting a gel manicure and when I took it off my nails did look a little worse, but not terribly so.  A couple more uses of this has helped repair them again.</li>
            <li> I have never, ever had long healthy nails in my life!! My nails always chip and break when I let them get long and if I don&#x27;t take my vitamins then they chip when short. I took a leap of faith and bought this product hoping it would work and I am amazed. I get compliments on my nails all the time, they are long, healthy, strong and beautiful for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier and I recommend this product to everyone who compliments my nails.</li>
            <li> I stopped using nail polish because it would weaken my nails.  Now I can wear this base coat and not have to worry about weak nails!  My nails are nice and hard.  There&#x27;s still a bit of stain on my nail when I wear polish but eh, I&#x27;ll take it.  I thought base coats prevent nail staining but I guess not.  At least my nails stay strong.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is helping my natural nails stay strong and grow out.  It also helps to keep nails from absorbing polish colors.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on the nails, u have to use not so much, it helps the nails, the only thing what should be better is the drytime</li>
            <li> The previous base coat I used was Seche rebuild, and I couldn&#x27;t find it again. So I remember looking through nail strengtheners and came across this one. It looked very similar to Seche so I tried it out. It&#x27;s perfect. It makes your manicure look clean and smooth whether you are putting a color on top of it or not. It lasts a long time and it&#x27;s my favorite nail base. All together Essie is a great brand which makes it my favorite nail polish company. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This nail polish does it&#x27;s job! Goes on first, keeps my nails from turning yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Not too expensive and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that this base coat did any sort of nail &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; for me. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough--I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again IF I had the opp. to purchase a base coat that is better.</li>
            <li> Essie says this does not contain formaldehyde, but it does.  Base coat works ok but improperly decribed on Amazon.  Looking for a good one without the harsh and harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> When doing all the steps for a home manicure,&lt;br /&gt;this is a great base coat. I liked it and would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to anyone looking for good quality.</li>
            <li> My nails were reinforced when wearing this base coat.They felt much stronger.I usually wear gel polish,but every once in awhile I like to take a break from the gels.This stuff really delivers.....</li>
            <li> Essie is the best of the best. Nothing else will ever go on my nails. The vibrancy of their colors can not be matched, There quality is far better than any other polish I have ever used, and my nails are healthier and stronger all of which I give full credit to Essie.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Essie polish customer. I think their colors are the prettiest and quite long lasting. I wanted to try an Essie base coat so I landed on this one. It actually makes a nice semi-translucent polish if you wear it by itself but as a base coat I am not too impressed. It chips really easily near your nail beds no matter how much you prep them. I don&#x27;t hate this base coat, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be doing the job it promises to do. It allows the polish to go on without streaking and holds up well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got it for myself and for my friend and she did notice difference in her nails. They are a lot stronger now. My nails have always been pretty strong but I love this as the bottom coat because it doesn&#x27;t leave my nails with a yellow tint especially after I use a black nail polish. For some reason whenever I use a black nail polish my nails have a slight yellow tint (doesn&#x27;t matter if it is store brand or expensive brand, and doesn&#x27;t matter of the base coat either). This base coat however makes my nails stronger and keeps them without than nasty yellow tint.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for about a year now and I cannot complain. And neither can my friend. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, seemed like polish chipped worse than without base coat or as compared to other base coats - BUT - Essie refunded my money when I sent a note via their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate a company that stands by their product and customers (hence five stars).</li>
            <li> I have used this product regularly and I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in the strength or growth.Not what I expected from an Essie product</li>
            <li> Ok...the best base coat ever!!  I have been around the block a time or two where nail polishes are concerned.  When I got this base coat, my nails were fragile &amp; peeling because I picked off the gel polish I was wearing.  My nails looked HORRIBLE!!!  One application of this base coat has my natural nails back in tip-top shape.  There will never be another base coat in my polish bin :-)</li>
            <li> Always use this one as a base. Works good and maintain the nails well. Will buy it again after finish this one.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, protects my nails from discoloration from colored polish, and makes other coats glide on super smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I highlight recommend this to use as a base coat on your nails. If i leave my manicure on for too long, I usually have a yellow nail dilemma - this works wonders at protecting my nail and giving it life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Essie but bought this when I bought a new polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did two base coats because I wanted to, two layers of an OPI polish and finished it off with a quick drying topcoat from BUTTER. It lasted three days chip free and I was pretty rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weirdly I could peel off the polish like you can with gel nails (which you aren&#x27;t supposed to do). Perhaps this was caused by the two coats? I probably ruined my nails by doing that. I now have the base coat and a clear top coat so they can recover.</li>
            <li> I really love this base coat it made my nails smooth and soft, it helped to prevent the nail polish from staining</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! Essie is great! I buy all their products and have never been let down! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this base coat because a you-tube video blogger always painted her nails and mentioned she used this as a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it fine, but I bought it too late; my nails were already becoming brittle and starting to flake at the tips from too many nail polish applications and removals.  I&#x27;m waiting for my nails to heal until I go back to painting them again, but I will certainly be putting on this as a coat beforehand, and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, with a bit of a white tint to it, which I like well enough because you can make sure you&#x27;ve covered the whole nail.  It dries smoothly so that putting polish over it glides on just right.  Seems like a good addition to anyone&#x27;s nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> This base coat is great. you can wear it as clear polish and not paint your nails and it keeps your nails very strong and healthy. It also works really well as a base coat especially because it is not absolutely clear its translucent so it makes whatever color you wear on top pop!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly if you want to keep you nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write this review based on my bizarre experience with this product. I am an exclusive Essie polish user, so I thought I&#x27;d try this as my base coat. Well, when I started using it, I found that in only a few weeks (like, two or even less), my nails really dried out, got hard as rocks, and started splitting on the sides. At first I thought it was just my bad luck with the damage to them, but seriously, within just a few days of each other, they ALL split on the sides and some even totally ripped off to the fingertip because they&#x27;d split on BOTH sides of the nail. And the hard as hell nails on top of it? It was like I had acrylics on, but they felt awful. Not flexible at all. I cut all of them at where they&#x27;d split and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash to this past two weeks. I&#x27;d been using another base coat but decided to go back to this one just in case I was being ridiculous about them causing my nails to dry out and break. Well, I have to tell you - it&#x27;s been just shy or two weeks of using it again after a 3 month hiatus and EIGHT of my nails are split on the sides again, as well as three of them actually peeling in half at the tip! This is NOT coincidental, people. I have no idea WTF is in this stuff, but I&#x27;ve never, ever had this happen. I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because I can&#x27;t technically prove that this product is the cause of my issue, but damn, if it&#x27;s not I can&#x27;t imagine what is. For three months I had no issues and now in under two weeks, my nails are craptastical all over again. Coincidence? I think not. So as far as this base coat goes... RUN AWAY!!! RUN AWAY!!!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/30/13: As my nails grow out, they continue to peel in half, as in, peeling a top layer of nail off - leaving a flimsy, half-thickness nail in its place. It&#x27;s definitely due to damage caused by the FORMALDEHYDE in this product! Only 4 of my 10 nails even look normal right now. About to cut them all off and start from scratch. I&#x27;ve already started using Nailtiques on them to try to make them healthy again, as well as started to take a biotin vitamin supplement. I&#x27;m praying this works or it&#x27;ll be a loooong time until they grow out from the nail bed. Changing from 2 starts to 1 - Stay FAR AWAY from this product...Nailtiques on them to try to make them healthy again, as well as started to take a biotin vitamin supplement. I&#x27;m praying this works or it&#x27;ll be a loooong time until they grow out from the nail bed. Changing from 2 starts to 1 - Stay FAR AWAY from this product...</li>
            <li> This is the only none drugstore base coat I have tried on my nails, I have been using it for more than a year and I like it how it does protect my nails from getting yellow. Mind you, I don&#x27;t change my polish weekly, I would say almost bi-weekly and sometimes I take a week break or two. During winter time when I tend to use very dark polishes and keep up my manicure often (I like to see nice nails when gloves are taken off...)m Essie&#x27;s protein base coat does the job well.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails a few months ago, and this polish is a great base coat.  It goes on smooth, and it is not clear, so it creates a good base for sheer nail colors.  This is a very important new HG product for my weekly home manicure :)</li>
            <li> I love that this base coat really protects my nails and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like OPI base coats I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> protects my nails, actually, I feel they are stronger since I started using this under my polish.&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again.</li>
            <li> ive bought base coats before and thought they were a scam but this one is amazing. The other brand I had was okay but this makes your mani last longer and makes the color more bright and fuller.</li>
            <li> good quality base, apply before colors and will keep your nails hydrated and give a nice protective and smooth layer</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is a nail tech who uses this product.  I already knew I liked it because it has done wonders for my weak, brittle nails.  I liked it even more because of the price on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Excellent products! I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
