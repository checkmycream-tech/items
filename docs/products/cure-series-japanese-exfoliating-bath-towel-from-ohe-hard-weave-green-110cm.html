            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect for</li>
            <li>Excellent and speedy service, thank you!  </li>
            <li>This thing is truly amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect length.</li>
            <li>The best shower accessory.  </li>
            <li>Great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>These are great body polishing cloths.  </li>
            <li>These nylon bath towels are great for exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my roommate because she loved it as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Well, with the shipping costs it is kind of steep priced for a wash cloth/towel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a hybrid between a nicely textured shower sponge/poof (just more texturized...</li>
            <li>It works better folded over anyway</li>
            <li>, I think it makes it foam up more.</li>
            <li>BUT the colour is fabby and matches my bathroom :)</li>
            <li>Much better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love about this product</li>
            <li>I use and really love</li>
            <li>Having said that, once I used them the feeling was great and after a shower my skin felt very stimulated.  </li>
            <li>Yon can make your shower better by using this towel.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent exfolliating cloth that lasts a very long time....</li>
            <li>is how easy it rinses and the way it lathers my soap.</li>
            <li>The towel is easy washable and almost instantaneously dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This towel, however, gets the soap into a nice, rich lather and keeps it for ages, and yet it&#x27;s easy to rinse out right after.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty impressed, so why not a five star review?</li>
            <li>Your skin loves this for a smooth and shiny feel and look.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m able to stretch the soap out more, rather than having to add pumps, but without it taking eons to rinse out when I&#x27;m ready, unlike with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfect length so you can scrub your back and I love how rough it is.</li>
            <li>but, as someone mentioned before, it&#x27;s good for getting your back and the bottoms of your feet with ease.</li>
            <li>drys quickly and rinses even quicker.</li>
            <li>truthfully didn&#x27;t realize they came in \\&quot;strengths\\&quot;, I just loved the color for my green bathroom!</li>
            <li>This is exactly I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>: good feel, but the material is too absorbent which makes it too heavy to use comfortably</li>
            <li>is SO SOFT AND SMOOTH after my showers!</li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely soft afterwards and, of course, my products work better.</li>
            <li>It helps to clean and massage the skin; very convenient to rub the back and any part of your body, and leave you with the nice feeling of freshness and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I had been looking for:</li>
            <li>Authentic Japanese scrub.</li>
            <li>I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it last for six months or more.</li>
            <li>First I saw this towel in my mom&#x27;s house and ordered it for myself.  </li>
            <li>Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse with bucket water and finally one more time with shower.</li>
            <li>They work better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast, price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>This is the classic exfoliating towel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>The blue is very course and more rough</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely planto buy a few more.</li>
            <li>Other than that it fine.</li>
            <li>This is just right for an asian scrub towel.</li>
            <li>it is very soft.  </li>
            <li>The long length makes washing your back easy too.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft after a shower.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I used it gently on my face and it definitely made a difference there as well.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t soft but are not harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>Much softer and gentler than the traditional salux towel.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and it allows you to use just a few drops of body wash instead of having to use a lot to form suds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought these because they really exfoliate without tearing or irritating my skin and my skin</li>
            <li>product seems to be very well made, sturdy, and has adequate amount of texture to exfoliate properly, but it&#x27;s not so rough to where I feel like my skin&#x27;s been abused shortly after going nuts with it.</li>
            <li>Accept no imitation, scrubbies or whatnot.</li>
            <li>The extra long length, 20cm over Salux, makes it much easier to wrap around areas and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first one I cut in half, but that was a mistake.</li>
            <li>Great, quick-drying exfoliating bath &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;, if one can get it in &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; - the softer ones are not nearly as exfoliating as the &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; but this one from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;, in &amp;#34;hard weave&amp;#34;, will do.</li>
            <li>Covers a wide area and leaves my skin smooth after removing the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>B005FAAB7M Nature&#x27;s Gate Acai Velvet Moisture Liquid Soap, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and their Papaya version, but neither lathers very well due to the lack of chemicals, so I constantly feel like I had to keep re-adding soap when I probably don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The previous item I purchased was much firmer.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily just before I use the Super Hard weave; DO NOT recommend for use on the face or those with sensitive/thin skin.</li>

            <li> I really like how these remove dead and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is well-made in Japan and seems it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rough (but not too rough), and not heavy while using.</li>
            <li> I prefer the blue for normal use and the green / pink length for traveling,</li>
            <li> Still course enough to feel rough.  </li>
            <li> I also tried out the blue one which is a little longer, but this is personal preference.  </li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and got one of these exfoliating towels</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on your preference on length, you could actually cut in half and make two cloths.  </li>
            <li> Shorter and less rough on your skin than the blue 120cm version.  </li>
            <li> During the summer I tend to get little red bumps all over which the dermatologists have told me are a form of acne.</li>
            <li> think the traditional version stripped my skin even with the least pressure possible</li>
            <li> Well I have been using the bath towel for a few weeks (with regular body wash) and they have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> This green is stronger harder feel than the blue but are not a scratchy feeling as the Salux.  </li>
            <li> the other two brands:&lt;br /&gt;- leyijie towels: it&#x27;s like using sandpaper</li>
            <li> Thankfully, even with my very sensitive skin the HARD WEAVE wasn&#x27;t too harsh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with various skin issues, and I believe a lot of is due to not getting enough exfoliation (not to mention dry weather/hard well water), but wash clothes, sponges, scrubs, and even my Clarisonic body brush either don&#x27;t do enough or are too tedious to keep up with.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with this product is that I had to get out the sewing machine, and using nylon thread, reduce its size.</li>
            <li> The green and pink 110cm</li>
            <li> Cuts down time and saves money!</li>
            <li> Basically, it does what my expensive brush, scrubs and whatever other products do, only for under $10 and with less mess/work involved.</li>
            <li> just not as hard a scrub as the other brand</li>
            <li> In fact, it almost feels like a little massage--though super-sensitive types may have a hard time with the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; weave.</li>
            <li> it is hard weave</li>
            <li> Hard weave is not *</li>
            <li> * hard if you&#x27;re used to washing with a rougher texture.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t rub overly hard.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the third brand bath cloth I have bought and it&#x27;s exactly what I had been looking for: it&#x27;s rough (but not too rough), and not heavy while using. The green and pink 110cm Cure towels are the leyije length.  I also tried out the blue one which is a little longer, but this is personal preference.  I prefer the blue for normal use and the green / pink length for traveling, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about the other two brands:&lt;br /&gt;- leyijie towels: it&#x27;s like using sandpaper&lt;br /&gt;- aquis: good feel, but the material is too absorbent which makes it too heavy to use comfortably</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...It is an excellent exfolliating cloth that lasts a very long time....drys quickly and rinses even quicker.</li>
            <li> Since my daughter introduced these to me, I&#x27;ve used them ever since.  I visited Japan&lt;br /&gt;and went to a Sento and was intrigued by its use.  I just feel its a thorough and deep&lt;br /&gt;clean.</li>
            <li> I definitely will buy this again !!</li>
            <li> Delivery: Got here on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: Ive used the axe two-sided loofahs and the bristle brushes. This scrub cloth has them both beat. Covers a wide area and leaves my skin smooth after removing the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> These towels are the BEST. I bought one for my roommate because she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> These did not come with English instructions, but I read a couple reviews that explained them. They work better than I expected. My first one I cut in half, but that was a mistake. It started to fray. It works better folded over anyway, I think it makes it foam up more. I really like how these remove dead and dry skin. I found these on a Recommended For You list on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the same item and seller I supposedly bought from a yr or so ago.  But no it is not.  States it is hard weave and it is not, it is very soft.  The previous item I purchased was much firmer.  I will use them anyway but will be more wary of where I get my next one.</li>
            <li> but not quite what I hoped for -&lt;br /&gt;its just not as hard a scrub as the other brand BUT the colour is fabby and matches my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> Shorter and less rough on your skin than the blue 120cm version.  Still course enough to feel rough.  The blue is very course and more rough overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to feel the towel but don&#x27;t want to feel as though it&#x27;s scraping your skin off, go with this one over the blue.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and I hesitated to try this but my Bath and Bodyworks shower \\&quot;puff\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t exfoliating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truthfully didn&#x27;t realize they came in \\&quot;strengths\\&quot;, I just loved the color for my green bathroom! Thankfully, even with my very sensitive skin the HARD WEAVE wasn&#x27;t too harsh! It&#x27;s just perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought these because they really exfoliate without tearing or irritating my skin and my skin is SO SOFT AND SMOOTH after my showers!</li>
            <li> Excellent and speedy service, thank you!  Great, quick-drying exfoliating bath &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;, if one can get it in &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; - the softer ones are not nearly as exfoliating as the &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; but this one from &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;, in &amp;#34;hard weave&amp;#34;, will do.</li>
            <li> The perfect length so you can scrub your back and I love how rough it is. It makes my skin feel soft after a shower.</li>
            <li> This thing is truly amazing!!!  I wanted to try this before I bought something that is $50.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  My skin is soft and glowing.  I used it gently on my face and it definitely made a difference there as well.  I received this in 1 day!!!  Will buy from again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product works just as it is described. During the summer I tend to get little red bumps all over which the dermatologists have told me are a form of acne. Well I have been using the bath towel for a few weeks (with regular body wash) and they have all but disappeared. My skin is soft and smooth and it allows you to use just a few drops of body wash instead of having to use a lot to form suds. Overall I am pretty impressed, so why not a five star review? Well, with the shipping costs it is kind of steep priced for a wash cloth/towel.</li>
            <li> Authentic Japanese scrub. Perfect length.</li>
            <li> Hard weave is not *that* hard if you&#x27;re used to washing with a rougher texture. I use this daily just before I use the Super Hard weave; DO NOT recommend for use on the face or those with sensitive/thin skin. Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse with bucket water and finally one more time with shower. Cuts down time and saves money! I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it last for six months or more.</li>
            <li> Accept no imitation, scrubbies or whatnot. This is the classic exfoliating towel.</li>
            <li> This is just right for an asian scrub towel. It is well-made in Japan and seems it will last a long time. I am accustomed to throwing these in the wash occasionally. Will purchase again, if it maintains its exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a luffa and we found this.  Much better.  Great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with various skin issues, and I believe a lot of is due to not getting enough exfoliation (not to mention dry weather/hard well water), but wash clothes, sponges, scrubs, and even my Clarisonic body brush either don&#x27;t do enough or are too tedious to keep up with. So I finally broke down and got one of these exfoliating towels and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Basically, it does what my expensive brush, scrubs and whatever other products do, only for under $10 and with less mess/work involved. Score! It&#x27;s kind of a hybrid between a nicely textured shower sponge/poof (just more texturized...finally) in the shape of a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be very well made, sturdy, and has adequate amount of texture to exfoliate properly, but it&#x27;s not so rough to where I feel like my skin&#x27;s been abused shortly after going nuts with it. In fact, it almost feels like a little massage--though super-sensitive types may have a hard time with the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; weave. My skin feels extremely soft afterwards and, of course, my products work better. I just don&#x27;t rub overly hard. I&#x27;ll have to get to used to the length but, as someone mentioned before, it&#x27;s good for getting your back and the bottoms of your feet with ease. I personally wouldn&#x27;t mind a smaller size, but I just bunch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this product is how easy it rinses and the way it lathers my soap. I use and really love [[ASIN:B005FAAB7M Nature&#x27;s Gate Acai Velvet Moisture Liquid Soap, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and their Papaya version, but neither lathers very well due to the lack of chemicals, so I constantly feel like I had to keep re-adding soap when I probably don&#x27;t. This towel, however, gets the soap into a nice, rich lather and keeps it for ages, and yet it&#x27;s easy to rinse out right after. I feel like I&#x27;m able to stretch the soap out more, rather than having to add pumps, but without it taking eons to rinse out when I&#x27;m ready, unlike with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely planto buy a few more.</li>
            <li> These are great body polishing cloths.  This green is stronger harder feel than the blue but are not a scratchy feeling as the Salux.  Having said that, once I used them the feeling was great and after a shower my skin felt very stimulated.  The extra long length, 20cm over Salux, makes it much easier to wrap around areas and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your preference on length, you could actually cut in half and make two cloths.  You might consider treating the cut ends with a flame to melt in order to prevent the fabric from unraveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and very pleased.</li>
            <li> First I saw this towel in my mom&#x27;s house and ordered it for myself.  This is exactly I was looking for!  It helps to clean and massage the skin; very convenient to rub the back and any part of your body, and leave you with the nice feeling of freshness and rejuvenated.  The towel is easy washable and almost instantaneously dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> These nylon bath towels are great for exfoliating your skin. They aren&#x27;t soft but are not harsh on your skin. The long length makes washing your back easy too.</li>
            <li> Much softer and gentler than the traditional salux towel. My skin loves this- sofer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I think the traditional version stripped my skin even with the least pressure possible</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with this product is that I had to get out the sewing machine, and using nylon thread, reduce its size. Other than that it fine.</li>
            <li> The best shower accessory.  Ever.</li>
            <li> Every bath towel isn&#x27;t the same. This is a good one. Yon can make your shower better by using this towel. Your skin loves this for a smooth and shiny feel and look. Get one and see this for you too.</li>
