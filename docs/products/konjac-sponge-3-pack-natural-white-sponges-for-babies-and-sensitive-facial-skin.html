            <li>They look nice but haven&#x27;t tried them as they are for a gift.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a wonderful product with fast delivery</li>

            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciated The Beauty Shelf&#x27;s follow-up to ensure I received my sponges and was happy with them.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper than many of the singles and multi-packs found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the jelly-like substance on the inside.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; but she ended up liking these more than the rest of the gift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, she thought the box was adorable.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many combinations in an effort to get rid of my make-up with the sponge.  </li>
            <li>Plus the packaging they come in is really cute :)</li>
            <li>Great for my baby girl&#x27;s sensitive and eczema skin!!</li>
            <li>They are really cute and easy to hold even with slippery soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update again: The seller is very nice to send me a new pack of sponges for me to try them out.</li>
            <li>Great sponges for baby&#x27;s bath, they are soft for the babies and durable.</li>
            <li>They work great just need to remember to put it in the water before I put the babies in to get it soft.</li>
            <li>In fact,  I loved them so much that now I use them</li>
            <li>They arrive in a cute package, and the customer service is thorough and friendly.</li>
            <li>These things are so handy and way more gentle than scrubs or even a clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>Very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect cleansing/exfoliating tool that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or major breakouts from too much abrasion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with that</li>
            <li>Plus they are super cute</li>
            <li>these little heart shaped sponges are the best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much exfoliating it&#x27;s doing on my face yet, but it feels really nice and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an affordable pack of great konjac sponges, definitely this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Great facial scrubber!!</li>
            <li>The feeling of massaging my face with it is incomparable.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using it to wash my face.</li>
            <li>these are nice, feel great, removes make-up well, doesn&#x27;t waste soap.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making these!!!</li>
            <li>These sponges are very gentle and not infused with anything, which is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Came individually wrapped which was nice!</li>
            <li>Lovely product, excellent service, minimal (environmentally friendly) packaging, clear care instructions.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough fo my babies skin and just perfect for bath time.</li>
            <li>I use a rag to clean her face and the sponge for her body.</li>
            <li>You get plenty of surface space to clean your face or whatever you decide to use this on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i use the bottom of the heart to clean his neck crevices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very smooth, gently removing cleanser or exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse thoroughly and avoid wringing the sponge - pressing it between your palms is the best way to remove extra water without damaging the fibers, and then hang to dry.  </li>
            <li>I need a good clean when I wake up, but not a Clarisonic deep clean.</li>
            <li>Thee gift was most appreciated.  </li>
            <li>After wetting my face/using a creamy cleanser, I use the sponge to gently exfoliate and remove most of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are so gentle on my face and the heart shape is adorable.</li>
            <li>They are soft and feel nice on skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in tact as described.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed these and will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>It saves on soap though because it lathers up tremendously.</li>
            <li>I love it on my 2yr old!!</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little bigger, but I love their durability, and the price is great!</li>
            <li>It lathers up face cleanser very well and rinses out easily, just like a sponge should do.</li>
            <li>I love these sponges so far!</li>
            <li>The shape provides more surface area to use when washing and rinsing, and is easy to press extra water out of before hanging to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The string on the sponges is really helpful for drying, and the quality of these is fabulous.</li>
            <li>So far, I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also never purchased cosmetics on Amazon, so maybe this is not as rare as I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So simple and effective.</li>
            <li>and I do have to say that sponging them with this is so quick and easy and soft on them.</li>
            <li>They are as good of quality as any other konjac sponge</li>
            <li>They get so soft yet clean so thoroughly, I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, I wish I had bought these months ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant and it went away completely after a couple of uses, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>They really love washing themselves with it - it&#x27;s a good size for them - and that little string helps it dry hanging from the handle.  </li>
            <li>These sponges seriously work and will be a welcome addition to your face cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>Many natural cleansers don&#x27;t lather, so this sponge helps me use less product as well since it creates more lather and volume</li>
            <li>But it works out fine in general as its hardness helps exfoliate.</li>
            <li>They are very effective for gentle exfoliation; it would be hard to irritate your skin with these.</li>
            <li>and they even foamed that stuff up, which is pretty hard to get to a good foam by hand/washcloth</li>
            <li>If you use a foam cleanser, you can place a small amount directly on the sponge and will get a great lather.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth when wet and hold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what the image shows; she&#x27;s already re-purposed the box for storing her other bathroom stuff in and is already dropping hints for more of these.</li>
            <li>The sponges give me that feeling of a good clean without the tight and dry feeling</li>
            <li>They dry pretty quickly in just a day and its always fun watching it grow as it soaks up water.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my face while cleansing &amp; exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I bought these to share with my kids because I wanted a gentle yet exfoliating face sponge for myself and a body sponge for them.  </li>
            <li>These are much softer than I thought they would be-</li>
            <li>I think this is what makes them so gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very bouncy feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>They hold soap really well also.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I really had to think about these</li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be gentle</li>
            <li>really like the tone.</li>
            <li>This seller seems to really care about the experience/product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Absorbs soap well to keep it nice and soapy and is soft and gentle enough (after soaking in water) for my 4 month old.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical because of the price of these sponges and the fact that they are hard when dry, BUT I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome they are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, she really likes the heart shape, much more than the rounded ones she&#x27;s tried before based on the different edges she can utilize around various areas of her face (nose, eyes).</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I don&#x27;t mind paying it since they last very long and don&#x27;t wreck my face :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using konjac sponges for a few months now and they are amazing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very comfy, soft and gentle to baby skin.</li>
            <li>Yet, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because of  its high quality.  </li>
            <li>I got her the three set of white hearts as I heard they provided the most versatile surface (point, flat part, rounded edge)</li>
            <li>I like these a lot, they are gentle on my sensitive skin but exfoliates well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel like a normal sponge; they are like if a sponge was made out of a sturdy gelatin.</li>
            <li>When you wet them, within a few seconds they become soft and they feel great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally do that after after I&#x27;ve thoroughly cleansed my skin.  </li>
            <li>They become so soft and gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for the sponge to plump up for first use, and the loop to hold it up is very clever.  </li>
            <li>But since I have already used it for a while, I think it may be the time to replace the sponge by a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use, I generally place the sponge in a small dish of warm water for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin/rosecea</li>
            <li>But this sponge is very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all</li>
            <li>Until recently, as we have the heat on, the sponge dries very fast over night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad a purchased because it&#x27;s gentle enough for my little one.</li>
            <li>They are so soft you can use them everyday, yet just abrasive enough that you get a really nice exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li>Once it has dried out and you make it absorb water and use it again, it falls apart so easily.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using a Konjac sponge, better than simply rinsing with water (especially with the hard water we have here).  </li>
            <li>My rosacea has is almost clear.</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tried them with my old Cetaphil cleanser</li>
            <li>I use this on a daily basis and it really works well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After rinsing the sponge, I go over again to remove as much cleanser as possible before using an alcohol-free aloe toner to remove any residual cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Washcloths tended to aggravate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it now on my 3 year old and 18 month old</li>
            <li>They are soft on my sons skin</li>
            <li>so we soak them in hot water after each use and then squeeze out the excess water and hang to dry.</li>
            <li>None of the fun gimmicks you see in other konjac sponges.</li>
            <li>I have bought a more expensive konjac sponge on amaOn previously, but these are a much better value.</li>
            <li>I really like that you only have to use a tiny bit of soap.</li>
            <li>These sponges gently remove my dry flakes and even seems to clear up those tiny blackheads I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really soft on my skin and it deep cleansing my skin</li>
            <li>These sponges (as silly as it may sound) have helped me establish a skin care routine, and my skin is showing the positive results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used other facial sponges before, all of which lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>Super gentle exfoliator, my skin looks amazing, and even my hormonal acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is!</li>
            <li>The problem is that if you have not used it for a couple of days, it would dry out completely.</li>
            <li>I like that they are natural and long lasting!</li>
            <li>If you soak it in water long enough, it actually gets quite soft.</li>
            <li>This time, I am especially cautious to not have them dry out completely.</li>
            <li>I will say, they do have a slight smell after the first time you &amp;#34;dehydrate&amp;#34; them (they come as totally dry and shriveled up sponges which you need to add water to).</li>

            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciated The Beauty Shelf&#x27;s follow-up to ensure I received my sponges and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper than many of the singles and multi-packs found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the jelly-like substance on the inside.  </li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; but she ended up liking these more than the rest of the gift.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, she thought the box was adorable.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many combinations in an effort to get rid of my make-up with the sponge.  </li>
            <li> Plus the packaging they come in is really cute :)</li>
            <li> Great for my baby girl&#x27;s sensitive and eczema skin!!</li>
            <li> They are really cute and easy to hold even with slippery soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update again: The seller is very nice to send me a new pack of sponges for me to try them out.</li>
            <li> Great sponges for baby&#x27;s bath, they are soft for the babies and durable.</li>
            <li> They work great just need to remember to put it in the water before I put the babies in to get it soft.</li>
            <li> In fact,  I loved them so much that now I use them</li>
            <li> They arrive in a cute package, and the customer service is thorough and friendly.</li>
            <li> These things are so handy and way more gentle than scrubs or even a clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> Very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect cleansing/exfoliating tool that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or major breakouts from too much abrasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with that</li>
            <li> Plus they are super cute</li>
            <li> these little heart shaped sponges are the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much exfoliating it&#x27;s doing on my face yet, but it feels really nice and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an affordable pack of great konjac sponges, definitely this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrubber!!</li>
            <li> The feeling of massaging my face with it is incomparable.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using it to wash my face.</li>
            <li> these are nice, feel great, removes make-up well, doesn&#x27;t waste soap.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making these!!!</li>
            <li> These sponges are very gentle and not infused with anything, which is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Came individually wrapped which was nice!</li>
            <li> Lovely product, excellent service, minimal (environmentally friendly) packaging, clear care instructions.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough fo my babies skin and just perfect for bath time.</li>
            <li> I use a rag to clean her face and the sponge for her body.</li>
            <li> You get plenty of surface space to clean your face or whatever you decide to use this on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i use the bottom of the heart to clean his neck crevices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very smooth, gently removing cleanser or exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse thoroughly and avoid wringing the sponge - pressing it between your palms is the best way to remove extra water without damaging the fibers, and then hang to dry.  </li>
            <li> I need a good clean when I wake up, but not a Clarisonic deep clean.</li>
            <li> Thee gift was most appreciated.  </li>
            <li> After wetting my face/using a creamy cleanser, I use the sponge to gently exfoliate and remove most of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> These sponges are so gentle on my face and the heart shape is adorable.</li>
            <li> They are soft and feel nice on skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in tact as described.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed these and will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> It saves on soap though because it lathers up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love it on my 2yr old!!</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger, but I love their durability, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> It lathers up face cleanser very well and rinses out easily, just like a sponge should do.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges so far!</li>
            <li> The shape provides more surface area to use when washing and rinsing, and is easy to press extra water out of before hanging to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The string on the sponges is really helpful for drying, and the quality of these is fabulous.</li>
            <li> So far, I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never purchased cosmetics on Amazon, so maybe this is not as rare as I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So simple and effective.</li>
            <li> and I do have to say that sponging them with this is so quick and easy and soft on them.</li>
            <li> They are as good of quality as any other konjac sponge</li>
            <li> They get so soft yet clean so thoroughly, I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, I wish I had bought these months ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant and it went away completely after a couple of uses, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> They really love washing themselves with it - it&#x27;s a good size for them - and that little string helps it dry hanging from the handle.  </li>
            <li> These sponges seriously work and will be a welcome addition to your face cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Many natural cleansers don&#x27;t lather, so this sponge helps me use less product as well since it creates more lather and volume</li>
            <li> But it works out fine in general as its hardness helps exfoliate.</li>
            <li> They are very effective for gentle exfoliation; it would be hard to irritate your skin with these.</li>
            <li> and they even foamed that stuff up, which is pretty hard to get to a good foam by hand/washcloth</li>
            <li> If you use a foam cleanser, you can place a small amount directly on the sponge and will get a great lather.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth when wet and hold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the image shows; she&#x27;s already re-purposed the box for storing her other bathroom stuff in and is already dropping hints for more of these.</li>
            <li> The sponges give me that feeling of a good clean without the tight and dry feeling</li>
            <li> They dry pretty quickly in just a day and its always fun watching it grow as it soaks up water.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my face while cleansing &amp; exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I bought these to share with my kids because I wanted a gentle yet exfoliating face sponge for myself and a body sponge for them.  </li>
            <li> These are much softer than I thought they would be-</li>
            <li> I think this is what makes them so gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very bouncy feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> They hold soap really well also.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I really had to think about these</li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be gentle</li>
            <li> really like the tone.</li>
            <li> This seller seems to really care about the experience/product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Absorbs soap well to keep it nice and soapy and is soft and gentle enough (after soaking in water) for my 4 month old.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical because of the price of these sponges and the fact that they are hard when dry, BUT I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome they are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, she really likes the heart shape, much more than the rounded ones she&#x27;s tried before based on the different edges she can utilize around various areas of her face (nose, eyes).</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I don&#x27;t mind paying it since they last very long and don&#x27;t wreck my face :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using konjac sponges for a few months now and they are amazing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very comfy, soft and gentle to baby skin.</li>
            <li> Yet, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because of  its high quality.  </li>
            <li> I got her the three set of white hearts as I heard they provided the most versatile surface (point, flat part, rounded edge)</li>
            <li> I like these a lot, they are gentle on my sensitive skin but exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel like a normal sponge; they are like if a sponge was made out of a sturdy gelatin.</li>
            <li> When you wet them, within a few seconds they become soft and they feel great on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally do that after after I&#x27;ve thoroughly cleansed my skin.  </li>
            <li> They become so soft and gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for the sponge to plump up for first use, and the loop to hold it up is very clever.  </li>
            <li> But since I have already used it for a while, I think it may be the time to replace the sponge by a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, I generally place the sponge in a small dish of warm water for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin/rosecea</li>
            <li> But this sponge is very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all</li>
            <li> Until recently, as we have the heat on, the sponge dries very fast over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad a purchased because it&#x27;s gentle enough for my little one.</li>
            <li> They are so soft you can use them everyday, yet just abrasive enough that you get a really nice exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li> Once it has dried out and you make it absorb water and use it again, it falls apart so easily.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using a Konjac sponge, better than simply rinsing with water (especially with the hard water we have here).  </li>
            <li> My rosacea has is almost clear.</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tried them with my old Cetaphil cleanser</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis and it really works well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After rinsing the sponge, I go over again to remove as much cleanser as possible before using an alcohol-free aloe toner to remove any residual cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Washcloths tended to aggravate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it now on my 3 year old and 18 month old</li>
            <li> They are soft on my sons skin</li>
            <li> so we soak them in hot water after each use and then squeeze out the excess water and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> None of the fun gimmicks you see in other konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> I have bought a more expensive konjac sponge on amaOn previously, but these are a much better value.</li>
            <li> I really like that you only have to use a tiny bit of soap.</li>
            <li> These sponges gently remove my dry flakes and even seems to clear up those tiny blackheads I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really soft on my skin and it deep cleansing my skin</li>
            <li> These sponges (as silly as it may sound) have helped me establish a skin care routine, and my skin is showing the positive results.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used other facial sponges before, all of which lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Super gentle exfoliator, my skin looks amazing, and even my hormonal acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is!</li>
            <li> The problem is that if you have not used it for a couple of days, it would dry out completely.</li>
            <li> I like that they are natural and long lasting!</li>
            <li> If you soak it in water long enough, it actually gets quite soft.</li>
            <li> This time, I am especially cautious to not have them dry out completely.</li>
            <li> I will say, they do have a slight smell after the first time you &amp;#34;dehydrate&amp;#34; them (they come as totally dry and shriveled up sponges which you need to add water to).</li>
            <li> The first konjac sponge I used was a half-sphere shape, which took a long time to dry and provided less usable surface area.  </li>
            <li> After month and a half still like new.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are so soft!  </li>
            <li> I use the devita aloe cleanser, which is all natural and has a slight foam to it when using this sponge vs. trying to get a lather in my hand.</li>
            <li> But I have been able to use the sponges everyday without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Single sponges are often sold for the same price!  </li>
            <li> You have to make them soft by filling them with water just like any other sponge!!</li>
            <li> Value - Current listed price ($12.97) works out to roughly $4.23/sponge.</li>
            <li> so they can air dry.</li>
            <li> so I can hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> These sponges are much smaller and much harder than expected.</li>
            <li> They came in a cute little heart-shaped ribboned box that I kept thinking was chocolates until I threw the box out for being constant disappointment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I&#x27;ll come back here and update the review if it starts to break down before it should be swapped out for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> I was hest siting to buy them, because I thought they might be too rough for my face.  </li>
            <li> After I ordered the sponges they sent me an email explaining how to use them and some other tips.</li>
            <li> I used to get with other sorts of cleansing brushes and soaps.</li>
            <li> and so does my other child.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the other versions offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hopeful the sponge would supplant cotton balls, wipes, or any other type of make-up removers.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer for these sponges to dry</li>
            <li> My other sponges felt like they could rip in half towards the end of their usefulness.</li>
            <li> Again, my complaint is that these sponges do not last.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s heavy, but you can feel some heft when it&#x27;s wet and with a little cleaning product in there.</li>
            <li> They have a slightly &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I ordered the white sponges, and I&#x27;m hoping that they - along with my usual skincare regimen - will help even my skin tone and eliminate (or at least drastically decrease) the appearance of dark spots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s, well, 3 times the size it was and seems to be tightly woven, so</li>
            <li> My little girl loves it.</li>
            <li> when soaked in water the sponge measures a little under 4 inches across and a little over 2.5 inches in height.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them everyday &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sponge for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I previously paid this price for 1 Sponge!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;They are small and hard.&amp;#34; Yes, they come dry, small, and hard.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to place it, but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable and like I said it does go away.</li>
            <li> Just that it is a bit small.</li>
            <li> Really small...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps with my son&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> (Not sure if I had got a lemon before.)</li>
            <li> I have to stoop quite a bit at the sink, and found splashing water to be very messy.  </li>
            <li> I tried cutting sponges to make them smaller, etc.</li>
            <li> Very small and hard.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that these actually got poor reviews.</li>
            <li> Before discovering konjac sponges, I was terrible about washing my face consistently.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as...a stale herbal smell?</li>
            <li> so exfoliation is very irritating.</li>
            <li> I felt bad for recycling mine.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> My skin has hated me as soon as I got to college.</li>

            <li> I have been trying to find the perfect sponge to bath my now 6-month-old daughter with since she was born. I tried cutting sponges to make them smaller, etc. I was sceptical because of the price of these sponges and the fact that they are hard when dry, BUT I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome they are. They soften in water and are the perfect size. definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> My favorite baby sponges. I bought those for my 10 yr kids and been taking bath only with that sponge. After month and a half still like new. Very smooth when wet and hold body wash / soap really nice, also makes good foam. Love them! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> these are nice, feel great, removes make-up well, doesn&#x27;t waste soap. also have a cute hang string for leaving in shower.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge. It&#x27;s gentle on my face while cleansing &amp; exfoliating. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these to share with my kids because I wanted a gentle yet exfoliating face sponge for myself and a body sponge for them.  They really love washing themselves with it - it&#x27;s a good size for them - and that little string helps it dry hanging from the handle.  I don&#x27;t know how much exfoliating it&#x27;s doing on my face yet, but it feels really nice and not abrasive.  Happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> I gave as a gift. The oerson was was very happy to receive them. And asked where I found them.</li>
            <li> Great sponges, use them when bathing the baby as they&#x27;re so gentle. I have bought a more expensive konjac sponge on amaOn previously, but these are a much better value. Will definitely be buying these again</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love these sponges! I have very sensitive skin/rosecea so exfoliation is very irritating. But I have been able to use the sponges everyday without irritating my skin. They have a slightly &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; texture which takes some getting used to. I use both a cleansing lotion and oil with them. They take my zinc oxide based sunblock off like its nothing, which was not the case with a cleanser alone!&lt;br /&gt;I also am very impressed with the Beauty Shelf&#x27;s customer service. After I ordered the sponges they sent me an email explaining how to use them and some other tips.</li>
            <li> these little heart shaped sponges are the best. I&#x27;m using them everyday &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.</li>
            <li> I love the konjac sponge it&#x27;s really soft on my skin and it deep cleansing my skin i love it so much love the colors</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love these sponges. And thank you for sending me an email on how to use them properly. They are perfect for my sensitive skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, I wish I had bought these months ago. Super gentle exfoliator, my skin looks amazing, and even my hormonal acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is! I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are much softer than I thought they would be- they fit perfectly in my hand when washing my baby.. Love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on a Korean Beauty blog. So far, I love them. They arrive in a cute package, and the customer service is thorough and friendly.</li>
            <li> I really love these sponges. I have quite sensitive skin and I was looking for alternative ways to cleanse my face without stripping it. Well I picked these up along with a lower ph cleanser and they&#x27;ve worked a dream. The sponges give me that feeling of a good clean without the tight and dry feeling I used to get with other sorts of cleansing brushes and soaps. They don&#x27;t feel like a normal sponge; they are like if a sponge was made out of a sturdy gelatin. I think this is what makes them so gentle on skin. They are also good at foaming up any type of cleanser. I tried them with my old Cetaphil cleanser and they even foamed that stuff up, which is pretty hard to get to a good foam by hand/washcloth/brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one has a string attached for hanging. I will say, they do have a slight smell after the first time you &amp;#34;dehydrate&amp;#34; them (they come as totally dry and shriveled up sponges which you need to add water to). It&#x27;s not unpleasant and it went away completely after a couple of uses, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I would describe it as...a stale herbal smell? Not sure how to place it, but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable and like I said it does go away. Overall a great product for a great value. I love the cute heart shape too!</li>
            <li> I love them!! My baby likes to play with it when I give her a bath..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the sponges.. :)</li>
            <li> The sponges are a great deal for the price. I love them and I will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Love the konjac sponge!!! Never tried them before and they are AMAZING! They become so soft and gentle for sensitive skin! Must have product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!  I bought the for my baby and they are so soft and perfect for him.  In fact,  I loved them so much that now I use them and so does my other child.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using a Konjac sponge, better than simply rinsing with water (especially with the hard water we have here).  It&#x27;s also very smooth, gently removing cleanser or exfoliant. It didn&#x27;t take long for the sponge to plump up for first use, and the loop to hold it up is very clever.  I believe it will stay cleaner that way than resting on something.  Also, the manufacturer/seller sends very helpful FAQ with advice on how to get the best out of the sponges.</li>
            <li> Amazing konjac trio! I love the heart shape. They came in a cute little heart-shaped ribboned box that I kept thinking was chocolates until I threw the box out for being constant disappointment. The sponges are wonderful, though!! Very bouncy feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable pack of great konjac sponges, definitely this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> excellent product and excellent service</li>
            <li> Really great sponges for a good price. The string on the sponges is really helpful for drying, and the quality of these is fabulous.They are very effective for gentle exfoliation; it would be hard to irritate your skin with these.</li>
            <li> These things are so handy and way more gentle than scrubs or even a clarisonic brush. I use this on a daily basis and it really works well. I use the devita aloe cleanser, which is all natural and has a slight foam to it when using this sponge vs. trying to get a lather in my hand. Many natural cleansers don&#x27;t lather, so this sponge helps me use less product as well since it creates more lather and volume i wouldn&#x27;t normally be able to get.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrubber!!</li>
            <li> Very small and hard. disappointed</li>
            <li> I previously paid this price for 1 Sponge! So getting 3 for this cheap is awesome. The seller went out of their way to send me a message telling me how to use the sponge (rehydrate them). Awesome sponges and great for my sensitive skin  Update: Ordered a second time and still awesome! Even arrived before the shipping estimate</li>
            <li> Great sponges for baby&#x27;s bath, they are soft for the babies and durable.</li>
            <li> Use these sponges for our newborn baby. They&#x27;re extremely gentle. They have a string so they can air dry. They hold soap really well also. Love these sponges.</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re soft enough fo my babies skin and just perfect for bath time.</li>
            <li> Great sponge for my toddler!</li>
            <li> Very soft and very safe to use on babies!! I love it on my 2yr old!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bathing my baby with this since birth. I&#x27;m glad a purchased because it&#x27;s gentle enough for my little one. I use a rag to clean her face and the sponge for her body.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not five stars only because it was a gift and not used yet.  Arrived quickly and in tact as described.  Thee gift was most appreciated.  Will report on how well it performs at a later date.</li>
            <li> Very comfy, soft and gentle to baby skin. it feels like rubbing jello form cheese on the baby&#x27;s skin!!! My little girl loves it. One of my best baby product purchased.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Just that it is a bit small.</li>
            <li> The sponges arrived on time and as described. I&#x27;ve been using them for both my baby and my face, and they&#x27;ve been great.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot, they are gentle on my sensitive skin but exfoliates well. They are really cute and easy to hold even with slippery soap. I appreciate that they have a string so I can hang it to dry. They dry pretty quickly in just a day and its always fun watching it grow as it soaks up water. I like that they are natural and long lasting! I always use this to cleanse my face nowadays.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.  Very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  I&#x27;ve used them every morning and night since receiving them, and I can feel a difference in the softness of my skin already.  I have sensitive skin so I ordered the white sponges, and I&#x27;m hoping that they - along with my usual skincare regimen - will help even my skin tone and eliminate (or at least drastically decrease) the appearance of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the price, size, and value of these sponges.  The first konjac sponge I used was a half-sphere shape, which took a long time to dry and provided less usable surface area.  These sponges are very gentle and not infused with anything, which is great for my sensitive skin.  The shape provides more surface area to use when washing and rinsing, and is easy to press extra water out of before hanging to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I generally place the sponge in a small dish of warm water for a minute or so.  After wetting my face/using a creamy cleanser, I use the sponge to gently exfoliate and remove most of the cleanser.  After rinsing the sponge, I go over again to remove as much cleanser as possible before using an alcohol-free aloe toner to remove any residual cleanser.  If you use a foam cleanser, you can place a small amount directly on the sponge and will get a great lather.  Be sure to rinse thoroughly and avoid wringing the sponge - pressing it between your palms is the best way to remove extra water without damaging the fibers, and then hang to dry.  The sponge feels soft and slippery, and is soothing for my skin, especially during this bitter northeastern winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed these and will be purchasing more in the future.  These should be replaced every 2-3 months, so 3 per pack provides a great value.  Single sponges are often sold for the same price!  Before discovering konjac sponges, I was terrible about washing my face consistently.  I have to stoop quite a bit at the sink, and found splashing water to be very messy.  Washcloths tended to aggravate my sensitive skin.  These sponges (as silly as it may sound) have helped me establish a skin care routine, and my skin is showing the positive results. I also appreciated The Beauty Shelf&#x27;s follow-up to ensure I received my sponges and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I am loving them!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in a gift basket. They look nice but haven&#x27;t tried them as they are for a gift.</li>
            <li> Cute, cheap, and effective!</li>
            <li> I love these konjac sponges! They are as good of quality as any other konjac sponge and I got a great deal of three for the price of one, maybe two. I can&#x27;t express enough how these sponges have made a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve been using konjac sponges for a few months now and they are amazing on my sensitive skin. They are the perfect cleansing/exfoliating tool that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or major breakouts from too much abrasion. I would definitely recommend these over a power cleaning brush or washcloth!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my babies at bath time. They work great just need to remember to put it in the water before I put the babies in to get it soft. It hardens after every use. It saves on soap though because it lathers up tremendously. Don&#x27;t use too much soap. You&#x27;ll never get it rinsed out.</li>
            <li> Really small... maybe it&#x27;s just me, but these are tiny!!! The size of a extra jumbo cotton ball...</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a review after I used them for a month. I use konjac sponges in my morning face cleansing routine. I need a good clean when I wake up, but not a Clarisonic deep clean. Cleanser with my hands and washcloths simply didn&#x27;t meet this requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things That Were Awesome:&lt;br /&gt;+ Size - when soaked in water the sponge measures a little under 4 inches across and a little over 2.5 inches in height. You get plenty of surface space to clean your face or whatever you decide to use this on.&lt;br /&gt;+ Sponge Density - Not that it&#x27;s heavy, but you can feel some heft when it&#x27;s wet and with a little cleaning product in there. My other sponges felt like they could rip in half towards the end of their usefulness. I couldn&#x27;t tell with this sponge. (For sanitary reasons I change my konjac sponges monthly.)&lt;br /&gt;+ Value - Current listed price ($12.97) works out to roughly $4.23/sponge. This is cheaper than many of the singles and multi-packs found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things That Were Not So Awesome:&lt;br /&gt;(I really had to think about these and I&#x27;m grasping at straws)&lt;br /&gt;- Drying time - The sponge density works against the drying time. It takes a little longer for these sponges to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;- Additional features (e.g. charcoal, clay, tea, etc.) - This is a basic konjac sponge. None of the fun gimmicks you see in other konjac sponges. I&#x27;m fine with that but if you&#x27;re looking for some specific properties these aren&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;- Gift box - The sponges are in a wonderful box with instructions for first time konjac sponge users or for gifting. I felt bad for recycling mine. I wish there was an option to not have it come in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the heart shape fool you. These sponges seriously work and will be a welcome addition to your face cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are so soft!  I love the jelly-like substance on the inside.  We use one every night on our 1-year-old in the bath.  I wish they were a little bigger, but I love their durability, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. My rosacea has is almost clear. I&#x27;ve been using the sponge for a few weeks. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be gentle but so glad I was wrong. I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered another set to keep on hand. Thank you for a wonderful product with fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product has made a visual difference. My complexion is brighter, clearer and is softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> Use it for my twins.  Not sure if it helps with my son&#x27;s eczema but it saves on liquid soap.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I was hest siting to buy them, because I thought they might be too rough for my face.  Not so.  When you wet them, within a few seconds they become soft and they feel great on your skin.  You will need to use a different eye makeup remover, because you don&#x27;t want to pull the skin around your eye.  But these are great for the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> Love! These sponges are so gentle on my face and the heart shape is adorable.</li>
            <li> These were part of a gift for a friend. I thought these would be an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; but she ended up liking these more than the rest of the gift. I got her the three set of white hearts as I heard they provided the most versatile surface (point, flat part, rounded edge) so I can&#x27;t speak to the other versions offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, she thought the box was adorable. It&#x27;s exactly what the image shows; she&#x27;s already re-purposed the box for storing her other bathroom stuff in and is already dropping hints for more of these. I&#x27;m starting to imaging her building a fort out of these boxes. The box is a nicely textured bard paper box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, she really likes the heart shape, much more than the rounded ones she&#x27;s tried before based on the different edges she can utilize around various areas of her face (nose, eyes). Hooray for the 5 minutes of research I did on shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I&#x27;ve forwarded all of the beauty shelf&#x27;s emails to her and she (and I) really like the tone. This seller seems to really care about the experience/product. Granted, we didn&#x27;t have an issue and didn&#x27;t try to return anything, but I&#x27;ve never gotten a follow up from another company I&#x27;ve purchased from on Amazon, so I think that says a lot. I&#x27;ve also never purchased cosmetics on Amazon, so maybe this is not as rare as I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s only had it for a day, so I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I&#x27;ll come back here and update the review if it starts to break down before it should be swapped out for sanitary reasons. Looking at the sponge after she soaked in it water for 5 minutes it&#x27;s, well, 3 times the size it was and seems to be tightly woven, so I&#x27;m not expecting any issues.</li>
            <li> Came individually wrapped which was nice! Great konjac sponge! Does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> The best bath sponge ever. I bought it for my 2-year-old son and I am using it too.</li>
            <li> Love these! My skin looks better than it has in years. I have very sensitive and dry skin. These sponges gently remove my dry flakes and even seems to clear up those tiny blackheads I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Thanks for making these!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for my son when bathing and I really like that you only have to use a tiny bit of soap. I just wish they were a bit larger in size.</li>
            <li> The sponge itself is marvelous, but it does not remove make-up.  That&#x27;s the sole reason I purchased mine.  Yet, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because of  its high quality.  The feeling of massaging my face with it is incomparable.  I normally do that after after I&#x27;ve thoroughly cleansed my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many combinations in an effort to get rid of my make-up with the sponge.  No luck, though!  I was hopeful the sponge would supplant cotton balls, wipes, or any other type of make-up removers.  Nonetheless, great product!</li>
            <li> My skin has hated me as soon as I got to college. But this sponge is very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all (I have acne and all that jazz). It doesn&#x27;t even hurt the blemishes that I&#x27;ve picked at (oops). It lathers up face cleanser very well and rinses out easily, just like a sponge should do. Granted, it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I don&#x27;t mind paying it since they last very long and don&#x27;t wreck my face :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Absorbs soap well to keep it nice and soapy and is soft and gentle enough (after soaking in water) for my 4 month old.</li>
            <li> Neat concept but I wonder about the bacteria and mold factor since its a reusable soonge</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I sent one to my sister as well, as she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller provides excellent and prompt service.  (Thank you!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE these Konjac sponges!  They get so soft yet clean so thoroughly, I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> These are perfectly shaped and sized for the face which is exactly what i wanted them for, and they were such a good price! Plus the packaging they come in is really cute :)</li>
            <li> I love these! I wanted to get one for my daughter but couldn&#x27;t pass up the 3 pack. They are so soft you can use them everyday, yet just abrasive enough that you get a really nice exfoliating effect. Plus they are super cute 😉 Also: YOU HAVE TO FILL THEM WITH WATER, PEOPLE!!!!!! I was shocked to see that these actually got poor reviews. Then chuckled to myself when I realized those people had not read how to use them. &amp;#34;They are small and hard.&amp;#34; Yes, they come dry, small, and hard. You have to make them soft by filling them with water just like any other sponge!!</li>
            <li> These sponges are much smaller and much harder than expected. But it works out fine in general as its hardness helps exfoliate. However, after occasional use for two months, the sponge starts to fall apart. I used other facial sponges before, all of which lasted much longer. Quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now I have had these sponges for a couple of months and have used two of the three. Again, my complaint is that these sponges do not last. The problem is that if you have not used it for a couple of days, it would dry out completely. Once it has dried out and you make it absorb water and use it again, it falls apart so easily. So I will not purchase these any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update again: The seller is very nice to send me a new pack of sponges for me to try them out. This time, I am especially cautious to not have them dry out completely. So even I am on business trips, I take the sponge with me. So the sponge works out well for me for the couple of months. I actually enjoy using it to wash my face. If you soak it in water long enough, it actually gets quite soft. (Not sure if I had got a lemon before.) Until recently, as we have the heat on, the sponge dries very fast over night. So I notice it starts to fall apart again. But since I have already used it for a while, I think it may be the time to replace the sponge by a new one.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this! I wish I&#x27;ve known about this 3 years ago after my firstborn. I use it now on my 3 year old and 18 month old and I do have to say that sponging them with this is so quick and easy and soft on them. I am going to buy my friend these for her baby shower. Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Great value! Arrived promptly in good condition.  Similar to a pricier sponge, works just as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and very good follow up.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this! Great for my baby girl&#x27;s sensitive and eczema skin!! :-0</li>
            <li> They are soft and feel nice on skin.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, excellent service, minimal (environmentally friendly) packaging, clear care instructions. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for the baby! Makes the soap suds up nicely!</li>
            <li> I love these sponges so far! We use them to wash my newborn with so we soak them in hot water after each use and then squeeze out the excess water and hang to dry. So simple and effective. They are soft on my sons skin and i use the bottom of the heart to clean his neck crevices.</li>
