    <ol>
            <li> Seems to work real well. I have more pep and energy.</li>
            <li> I started on Phase one about 6 days ago, I take a lot of medication that is constipating, thought this might help. I don&#x27;t understand if you are supposed to take Phase 1 then Phase 2, or both at the same time. I am on Pase 1 only now. Can anybody help me?</li>
            <li> This item is a waste of money. instead of relieving me this product bloated me.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.  I followed the instruction but never have daily bowel, let alone 2-3 bowels per day as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product does not work!  I tried it, followed all the instructions, and saw no differences in my body&#x27;s performance.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> No two people are alike, but I&#x27;ve always had a very sensitive stomach and have never had any problems taking Coltox over the last few months. I initially purchased one kit as part of a new fitness workout I was following, and my results were nice and regular. (The first 7-10 days were particularly productive but it was worth it.) Did not get any diarrhea or any bloating. I think this might be the best digestive health and regularity I have experienced in a long time, though keep in mind I&#x27;m pairing its use with better diet and regular exercise. Can&#x27;t recommend these pills highly enough.</li>
            <li> I found that this product performed just as they said it would. Works very well, no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I am pretty healthy and wanted to do a cleanse.  I was dissappointed that this product did not do that for me.  I found that I actually felt constipated at times, and no different than if I hadn&#x27;t taken this product.  I would not recommend this or buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Actually forgot I ordered this, it was so long ago. Sadly it never arrived so I cannot speak on it&#x27;s quality. Plan to try something from someone else. Hope to get my money back.</li>
            <li> Did flush a lot of toxins out. And i lost weight, 5 lbs in first week. Would do it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work , save your money! Tried drinking lots an lots of water for over two weeks nothing at all</li>
            <li> After taking your product I did not get the results that your advertisement promised. Instead I felt blotted all the time and it gave me gas but I never had the number of bowel movements that the product claimed that I should of had. I was greatly disappointed because this was a product that I could take without giving me a migraine so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> It did not work.I took as directed and was very disappointed in this product.I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> Dont work I loss my money and I have problem with my health for use this pills. Dont used this products</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the pills taste gross when ingesting them. It is best to take them with a flavored drink. I have not finished my bottles yet, but they do work really great. I do not recommend mixing these with other tablets, but they do a great job on their own.</li>
            <li> Better cleansers out there</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it worked as it claimed</li>
            <li> Have been on the product for a week, haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  I am up to 6 tablets a day of Phase 1 (this is the maximum they recommend) and nothing, if you know what I mean!  I am taking two tablets a day of Phase 2.  I will continue with the product for the recommended time, and report back if anything changes. Update - changed from 6 tabs a day of Phase 1 to 4 a day, kept on with 2 tabs a day of Phase 2, finally noticing a change.  Not significant as promised, but definitely more regular than normal.  Downside is noticeable increase in gas, yuck.  Will keep on the product for the recommended time, probably will not purchase again.  Would change to 3 stars, instead of the one I originally gave it.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more didn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;ve done detoxes before and after 5 days still no regular bowel movements.</li>
            <li> I ORDER THE COLTOX ON FRIDAY I RECEIVED ON TUESDAY....I TOOK THE PILLS LAST NIGHT AND IT IS WORKING ALL READY...I LOVE IT.I NEVER TOOK A COLON CLEANSE THAT WORKS SO FAST..THIS IS THE BEST...I LOVE YOU COLTOX FOR MAKING THIS GREAT PRODUCTS.I WILL BE DOING ANOTHER POST ONCE I FINISH TAKING THE COLTOX.....THANK YOU.... FOR ALL THE REVIEWS THEY WAS REALLY HELPFUL...THATS WHY I GOT THE PRODUCT....THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> After all the goof reviews about this product didnot work for me and my wife bad product save your $</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me...!!!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed about wasting my money...!....This did absolutely NOTHING...!!!!!! A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> The product arrived and as soon as took it I felt the difference  the next day. The directions are a bit confusing, but follow them as best you can. Is worth it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work for me, or maybe I didn&#x27;t need it. My &amp;#34;once a day&amp;#34; never increased, and never changed in quantity.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  The instructions say to take up to 3 tabs in the morning and 3 at night.  It had no effect on me when taking the max.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders for me. I used it faithfully &amp; I was very happy with my results. I do recommend this product to anyone having severe constipation issues. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as stated, waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> 12 Pills later and constipation!!! All of the pills are just sitting in my stomach. I took them as directed.</li>
