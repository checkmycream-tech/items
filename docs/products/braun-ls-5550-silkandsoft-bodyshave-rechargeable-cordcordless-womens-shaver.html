            <li>I got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor using this model.  </li>
            <li>Get rid of the gimmicks and just make a good electric shaver!  </li>
            <li>Gave to daughter as a gift, cannot stop talking about how great it is.</li>
            <li>It is a GREAT shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great battery charge &lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for underarms</li>
            <li>I have used Braun men&#x27;s shavers for many years and have always found them to produce excellent results.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver - no irritation, no razorburn [HURRAH!]</li>
            <li>My wife even let my 13 year-old daughter try it, but even she did not find it pleasant to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think my family is finished looking for a good rechargeable women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>I think my family is finished looking for a good rechargeable women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have a man&#x27;s Braun and I like it, so I figured it would be a good product.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t these companies make a good shaver anymore?</li>
            <li>but I honestly think that you are better off spending your time and money using a good quality bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>but I honestly think that you are better off spending your time and money using a good quality bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>So then I went and bought some nice shaving gel (don&#x27;t ask me why I thought that would make a difference</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it \\&quot;ultra smooth and silky\\&quot; like in the product description, but for an electric I was definitely impressed.</li>
            <li>so she was pleased about that.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter both love the [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I am so incredibly, amazingly pleased with the results I get from using this on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>I may have better results than some</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly more painless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see someone else had problems.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it needed a better charge</li>
            <li>Braun is much better than the remington</li>
            <li>An ok shave but not as close as I want &lt;br</li>
            <li>pay more attention or hairs</li>
            <li>But to be honest, after trying so many different makes and models of women&#x27;s shavers, my wife has come to the conclusion that there just isn&#x27;t a great shaver out there for women&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li>I find it very comfortable to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you have very sensitive skin, this is probably a very good alternative to a razor - at the time I wrote this, my razor routine was not getting along with my skin, and this was a good way to get the same shave I&#x27;d get from my razor (without the irritation).</li>
            <li>The unit is washable for super easy cleaning, which I love.  </li>
            <li>It is times like this that I am happy to be a man; only having to shave my face, which I find to be an easy chore.  </li>
            <li>o(this that I am happy to be a man; only having to shave my face, which I find to be an easy chore.  </li>
            <li>The upsides to this one are that it can be cord-powered or cordless and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable to use with no grabbing or pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li>The results were fabulous as well.  </li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s important to follow the directions and also to clean it after every use.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product, once you get used to it and have read the instructions.</li>
            <li>It left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean which she really likes too.</li>
            <li>This shaver frees me of discomfort altogether and allows me to quickly shave my underarms every day.  </li>
            <li>It is good for a quick touch up - but does not provide the silky smooth look I get with a wet razor.  </li>
            <li>- and as long as you follow the instructions - gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers stated, it does not pull at all, and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>However, for the amazing job it does in other areas - the price tag is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Her first attempt with this shaver did not work out well at all.  </li>
            <li>: I should add that, many years later, I  no longer use this.  </li>
            <li>which makes it MUCH easier to use - no messy gel or cream to clean</li>
            <li>After considerable research and reviewing other buyers&#x27; comments, I bought the Braun LS-5550 Shaver and am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have the Braun 8585 razor and like it so much, I decided to get this one for my wife.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to go over the same area several times to remove all the hair, but it&#x27;s a good quality shaver and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed in product.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted this to work).  </li>
            <li>This item didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>batteries last a really long time, and it&#x27;s easy to hold and to clean.</li>
            <li>but following the instructions REALLY makes a difference here.  </li>
            <li>[I&#x27;ve heard some people say the hair can come back faster, though I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with it]</li>
            <li>After 10 years my old razor quit working.</li>
            <li>They leave no stubble and look as though they were freshly shaved with a wet razor.  </li>
            <li>After a few more weeks she stopped using the Braun shaver entirely; finding that it was too much trouble to keep charged, pull out of the drawer to use, and then to clean the shaver just for use under her arms.  </li>
            <li>She had tried several other models from Panasonic, Norelco and Remington in the past and did not find any of them to do a good job at shaving her legs or under her arms.  </li>
            <li>This is now the 2nd new electric razor I purchased.</li>
            <li>It makes a fairly loud buzz sound, too, but I think that&#x27;s common.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>However, she admited that she needed to use it a few times to maybe get the hang of it a little better.  </li>
            <li>Braun really took into account the needs of delicate, sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>No oil is required to lube up the metal parts - a thin film of Vaseline is just fine.  </li>

            <li> Considering how much money I have spent on all of these useless devices, over the years, I would have to agree with her.  </li>
            <li> It works well for what it is, but if you&#x27;re used to using a razor and have a system down, this product will probably not improve your experience.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does a poor job on my legs.  </li>

            <li> I have the Braun 8585 razor and like it so much, I decided to get this one for my wife. She really likes it. No irritation in the bikini area or on her legs. She hasn&#x27;t tried her underarms yet. It&#x27;s easy to clean which she really likes too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife (she asked for it) and have been very disappointed. She doesn&#x27;t have coarse hair but still has to make pass after pass to get a presentable--but not smooth--feel. I gave it a shot on my face and worked just as poorly. An electric is supposed to be convenient not double or triple the time you spend shaving. The upsides to this one are that it can be cord-powered or cordless and is easy to clean. But who cares?</li>
            <li> I got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor using this model.  I like that I can use it with or without a cord.  I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it \\&quot;ultra smooth and silky\\&quot; like in the product description, but for an electric I was definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Braun LS-5550 shaver for my wife about a year ago.  She had tried several other models from Panasonic, Norelco and Remington in the past and did not find any of them to do a good job at shaving her legs or under her arms.  I have used Braun men&#x27;s shavers for many years and have always found them to produce excellent results.  Therefore I decided to order this Braun women&#x27;s shaver for my wife.  Her first attempt with this shaver did not work out well at all.  She found that it didn&#x27;t provide a close or consistent shave of her legs, and she complained of skin irritation after using it under her arms.  However, she admited that she needed to use it a few times to maybe get the hang of it a little better.  She read the manual several times, and tried using the shaver again and again over 3 to 4 months.  She found that she had to go over her legs again and again in order to shave the hair close enough to be acceptable.  She eventually built up a tollerance for using the razor under her arms so she was pleased about that.  Still, she finally decided that she would have to go back to using her bladed razor to shave her legs properly and would only use the Braun for under her arms.  After a few more weeks she stopped using the Braun shaver entirely; finding that it was too much trouble to keep charged, pull out of the drawer to use, and then to clean the shaver just for use under her arms.  The shaver has now been sitting in a bathroom drawer, unused for several months.  My wife even let my 13 year-old daughter try it, but even she did not find it pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am dissapointed in this Braun LS-5550 rechargeable shaver.  But to be honest, after trying so many different makes and models of women&#x27;s shavers, my wife has come to the conclusion that there just isn&#x27;t a great shaver out there for women&#x27;s legs.  Considering how much money I have spent on all of these useless devices, over the years, I would have to agree with her.  It is times like this that I am happy to be a man; only having to shave my face, which I find to be an easy chore.  Sorry ladies, but I honestly think that you are better off spending your time and money using a good quality bladed razor.  My wife and daughter both love the [[ASIN:B0001LQGFG Gillette for Women Venus Divine Razor]].  I think my family is finished looking for a good rechargeable women&#x27;s shaver.

I am so incredibly, amazingly pleased with the results I get from using this on my underarms.  I should shave every day, but with a wet razor cannot.  The rashes and irritation I get are horrible.  This shaver frees me of discomfort altogether and allows me to quickly shave my underarms every day.  They leave no stubble and look as though they were freshly shaved with a wet razor.  An attachment is provided for longer hair, which can be used on arms and the bikini area.  The trimmer helps to shape the bikini area too.  The results were fabulous as well.  No bumps, no ingrown hairs, no cuts or discomfort at all!  Braun really took into account the needs of delicate, sensitive skin!  The unit is washable for super easy cleaning, which I love.  No oil is required to lube up the metal parts - a thin film of Vaseline is just fine.  It has a rechargeable battery with a power cord, and comes with a draw string travel case.  The only downside is that it does a poor job on my legs.  It is good for a quick touch up - but does not provide the silky smooth look I get with a wet razor.  However, for the amazing job it does in other areas - the price tag is well worth it.  5 stars all around!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave well, not easy to plug into adapter and then put on shaver - sometimes doesn&#x27;t connect correctly and doesn&#x27;t charge.  Very dissappointed in product.</li>
            <li> Save your money - you will go over an area several times. I went back to my basic razor.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have used an electric shaver that has worked as well as this shaver.  The other cheaper ones I have purchased were a waste of money and fell apart quickly and did not hold the charge after only a few months of use.  I would recommend this shaver for those who don&#x27;t like to use a razor all the time.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t shave blade close, but I don&#x27;t think any electric could.</li>
            <li> When I first used this I tried to shave like I do with a normal razor and was disappointed with the results.  Then I went through the instructions and gave it another shot - completely different results.  I may have better results than some [my hair isn&#x27;t extravagantly thick] but following the instructions REALLY makes a difference here.  Check UK&#x27;s amazon - the reviews there are raving.  This is a nice shaver - no irritation, no razorburn [HURRAH!] - and as long as you follow the instructions - gives a good shave.  May not be as close as with a regular razor [I&#x27;ve heard some people say the hair can come back faster, though I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with it] but it&#x27;s certainly more painless.  Plus, it&#x27;s usable in the shower [not plugged in, mind you] which makes it MUCH easier to use - no messy gel or cream to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I should add that, many years later, I  no longer use this.  It works well for what it is, but if you&#x27;re used to using a razor and have a system down, this product will probably not improve your experience.  HOWEVER, if you have very sensitive skin, this is probably a very good alternative to a razor - at the time I wrote this, my razor routine was not getting along with my skin, and this was a good way to get the same shave I&#x27;d get from my razor (without the irritation).</li>
            <li> After considerable research and reviewing other buyers&#x27; comments, I bought the Braun LS-5550 Shaver and am very, very pleased.  At the moment, I use it solely to shave under my arms because of recent surgery and ongoing restrictions.  Just as other reviewers stated, it does not pull at all, and it does a good job.  I find it very comfortable to use and easy to clean.  It is a GREAT shaver.  I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before, so I have nothing with which to compare this one. It works pretty well on underarms and the bikini area, though it takes a long time to get your legs done, as you have to go quite slow and redo spots. It doesn&#x27;t give the smoothest shave either--not like a razor blade. You also cannot use it in the shower, which is unfortunate. It makes a fairly loud buzz sound, too, but I think that&#x27;s common.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The batteries last a really long time, and it&#x27;s easy to hold and to clean. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product, once you get used to it and have read the instructions. The biggest advantage for me is there&#x27;s no more razor burn or ingrown hairs! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The Braun LS-5550 Silk&amp;Soft BodyShave Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Women&#x27;s Shaver is absolutely useless, not fit for purpose.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the closest shave, but the battery lasts forever and it works well enough - and no nicks!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a present for my wife. She seems to like it. I have a man&#x27;s Braun and I like it, so I figured it would be a good product. It holds the charge a long time. I should have her write the review, she is the one to use it.</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do.  I don;t see why anyone would spend over a $100 for another shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see someone else had problems.  I recv&#x27;d this as a gift and am very disappointed. Multiple passes over thick coarse hair and stubble everywhere.  I thought maybe it needed a better charge so I recharged it.  That didn&#x27;t help.  So then I went and bought some nice shaving gel (don&#x27;t ask me why I thought that would make a difference but I really wanted this to work).  Still no good.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After 10 years my old razor quit working.This is now the 2nd new electric razor I purchased. Why can&#x27;t these companies make a good shaver anymore? Get rid of the gimmicks and just make a good electric shaver!  &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is much better than the remington I just ret&#x27;d but..... &lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great battery charge &lt;br /&gt;      An ok shave but not as close as I want &lt;br /&gt;      Great for underarms &lt;br /&gt;Cons: You must use their attachment or you will get razor burn, found out &lt;br /&gt;      the burned way. Read their instruction booklet. &lt;br /&gt;      Does not give a once over shave, takes a few times and I now need to &lt;br /&gt;      pay more attention or hairs are missed.  So aggravating! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t work very well. It wasn&#x27;t a close shave at all. I used it twice before my dog chewed it up. It left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it.</li>
