            <li>Does make consistent beautiful curls but...</li>
            <li>This curler is awesome, I&#x27;m another one with hard to curl hair, not with this tool though, curled all of my hair with great looking curls in about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Have never been able to get a curl to stay in my hair,  since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li>Needs a better release when hair gets miss fed.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this iron after watching many tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li>and I totally enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>It makes great curls that last.</li>
            <li>It holds a great curl all day long.</li>
            <li>Super easy and fast, pretty curls that actually stay all day,  my hair has never gotten caught or tangled up in it</li>
            <li>I got this item for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this Pro Curl to anyone.</li>
            <li>Curled with this easily right out of the box,  and even easier the second time,  and had curls that stayed in,  </li>

            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Only negative aspect is the one I received it does not look like brand new, had it a couple of scratches on it, but I kept anyway to avoid the returning and wait for another one since is in perfect function, but little disappointed.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little awkward to hold at first but easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> Slept on it, and woke up with loose waves for the next day.  </li>
            <li> IN THE RAIN,  with just s touch of spray,  and in dry weather with no spray!  </li>
            <li> , curl stayed all night and still had a slight curl the next morning</li>
            <li> When we would curl our hair with a regular curling iron or wand the curls would drop after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This with me doing it for her and being very careful.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Apparently I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but was a little scary.</li>
            <li> I received dusty and hairy</li>
            <li> I was afraid the hair was going to be broken off in chunks.  </li>
            <li> not curl the hair as it says on the box, it&#x27;s too expensive for not meeting its promises!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received dusty and hairy</li>
            <li> This is a great product for straight fine hair.Works just like it claims! Would highly recommend this Pro Curl to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have never been able to get a curl to stay in my hair,  since I was a kid.  Curled with this easily right out of the box,  and even easier the second time,  and had curls that stayed in,  IN THE RAIN,  with just s touch of spray,  and in dry weather with no spray!  Slept on it, and woke up with loose waves for the next day.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried before at my friends house and I totally enjoy the results. Only negative aspect is the one I received it does not look like brand new, had it a couple of scratches on it, but I kept anyway to avoid the returning and wait for another one since is in perfect function, but little disappointed.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product. Makes doing my hair a piece of cake and the curls last forever!!</li>
            <li> Love this curler! Super easy and fast, pretty curls that actually stay all day,  my hair has never gotten caught or tangled up in it and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I got this item for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It holds a great curl all day long. I am so glad I got it for her. I can&#x27;t wait to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Does make consistent beautiful curls but... My daughter&#x27;s hair got tangled up and stuck in it several times.  This with me doing it for her and being very careful.  Needs a better release when hair gets miss fed.  I was afraid the hair was going to be broken off in chunks.  It didn&#x27;t but was a little scary.</li>
            <li> Good product, good delivery</li>
            <li> not curl the hair as it says on the box, it&#x27;s too expensive for not meeting its promises!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Got stuck in the hair.  There is no safety to get the hair out.  There is no override to release the hair.  It was a nightmare.  Had to break the curler to get the hair out!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a family Christmas present for my 3 daughters and myself. It makes great curls that last. When we would curl our hair with a regular curling iron or wand the curls would drop after a few hours. This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this iron after watching many tutorials on YouTube. Apparently I was wrong. My hair got caught and it took a while to get it out. I&#x27;ll stick with my regular curling iron. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This curler is awesome, I&#x27;m another one with hard to curl hair, not with this tool though, curled all of my hair with great looking curls in about 10 minutes, curl stayed all night and still had a slight curl the next morning, it&#x27;s a little awkward to hold at first but easy to get the hang of.

            <li> Keeps tangling my hair. Planning to return.</li>
