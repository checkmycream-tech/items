            <li>i love it and have been using it for years, ever since my hairdresser turned me on to it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine using ANYTHING else on my hair :)</li>
            <li>THis shampoo makes my hair feel very clean.</li>
            <li>More fabulous product and better price.  </li>
            <li>You can easily wear &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>This organic shampoo along with the conditioner makes the hair feel full and soft, has a great fruity smell but not over-powering.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Hair captures light.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well; my hair is healthy with bounce and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean, citrus scent and works well for my color treated (</li>
            <li>Clean fresh hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was not  frizzy and styled very well leaving my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Same great shampoo I have used for several years.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and we have really hard water</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping the quality--nice fragrance!  </li>
            <li>Will purchase again as the price is right for the large container...</li>
            <li>Bought a smaller bottle through my salon but found the pricing through Amazon was better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but the stuff I received seemed and smells different.  </li>
            <li>I also love it because it has no perfumes, just natural scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me and I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>The new product does not smell as good as the previous version.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed is not water like most other shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>I only use a light oil spray while my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I purchased this exact product at my salon and the shampoo was a distant clear &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and had a distinct orange or citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is it a large bottle, and I wish it had a pump top dispenser.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>The color of the shampoo is white , lathers way too much, smells like coconut and leaves me with greasy hair after a day.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the Loma conditioners, my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>and my hair is so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had health problems I couldn&#x27;t find something that made my hair soft like it use to be until now.  </li>
            <li>I got a haircut after using Loma for several weeks; the barber asked me what I was using, because my hair was very soft and did not have any split ends.</li>
            <li>i was a little skeptical of the new bottle, but its JUST as good as the old stuff!</li>
            <li>I usually purchase this shampoo from a salon directly and have always been very happy with it, but this bottle of shampoo is not like what I have used in the past - not sure if it has been on the shelf too long or what it is</li>
            <li>This product came to me in a bottle not marked organic like the salon product did and had a sticker on the back marked organic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it is organic and it works. I use it daily. Only complaint is it a large bottle, and I wish it had a pump top dispenser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a years.  Switched to something else when I ran out but came running back.  Keeps my hair soft.  It is gluten free and not tested on animals which are great selling points.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact product at my salon and the shampoo was a distant clear &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and had a distinct orange or citrus smell. The lather was so so but I loved it because it wasn&#x27;t making me head oily after use. I user it with the conditioner which I still do use. This product came to me in a bottle not marked organic like the salon product did and had a sticker on the back marked organic. The color of the shampoo is white , lathers way too much, smells like coconut and leaves me with greasy hair after a day. I am not happy. Will never purchase from here again. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Great Gluten free shampoo. Smells great. I have used the product exclusively for several years. Healthy hair from a healthy product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; did not strip my hair.  Purchase this with that Daily conditioner and tried this together  and also used Peartin Fortifying Repairative serum ( now called Loma Fortifying Repairative Tonic) before I blow dried my hair.  My hair was not  frizzy and styled very well leaving my hair silky smooth.  I was so happy with this line of product that I told my cousin and she ordered the same and told her friends.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This with the loma moisturizing shampoo is the only thing I use. Great for colored hair and the two together help with sun fade.</li>
            <li> Love it ~ and no sulfides! (Arrived on schedule)</li>
            <li> Same great shampoo I have used for several years.  Thanks for keeping the quality--nice fragrance!  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing shampoo!  It has a clean, citrus scent and works well for my color treated (blow dried daily) hair.  Used in conjunction with the Loma conditioners, my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> lathers well for not having a lot of products that lather.  Smooth and cleaning.  A little goes a long way.  I am impressed and I have purchased this at least 3 times and will continue.  great brand, texture, cleaning, rinsing, feeling and smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped me keep my hair from turning into straw during the dry summers here in California. Works very nicely!</li>
            <li> Do you color your hair? Does the color fade within a few week&amp;#34;? Time to pick up your Loma organic shampoo. You will love the results.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!!!! Long time user!</li>
