            <li>MAKES MY HAIR SMOOTH, SILKY AND SHINY!!!</li>
            <li>My hair looks very nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for controlling fly-aways, but it&#x27;s not the best static reducer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>But if anything I still love CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion the best.</li>
            <li>and my hairdresser is always impressed with how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>Smells nice!  </li>
            <li>Good product, very nice smell and texture.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Does not look like there is oil in the hair and provides good shine</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as good.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good product to help me in my battle with the frizzies.</li>
            <li>good seller, I recommend the article came atiempo 100% recommended</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s really good, though I don&#x27;t think this will work on everyone.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>This is especially effective in humid environment where people don&#x27;t like oil on their hair, because this is really light.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>(I grow it out and donate it to wig companies, so I like to use good stuff on it).</li>
            <li>Im am so happy because now i can go to school with my hair straight without having to worry about it frizzing during the day and best of all</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, but the way it looks, I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li>I find it interesting that another reviewer has always been happy with Garnier and is now losing faith in the company -</li>
            <li>It leaves my ends looking very healthy.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome deal fr what its worth.</li>
            <li>it smeels really nice and can be used for diffent hair styles, for shine, anti-frizz and its a good amount of product.</li>
            <li>Smells very strongly of vanilla, so if you don&#x27;t mind vanilla smell, it is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>It works best for me right after I wash my hair</li>
            <li>Sounds perfect right?</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your hair very nicely, and makes it look so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this hair oil!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Would love to try an unscented version!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but turns out that I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Best part is, you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the effect!</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper though, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Super good investment !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly saved me from chopping 3-4&amp;#34; off the end of my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>If my hair gets too frizzy, the curls just kind of give out and lose their spirally shape.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product to try and see what results would derive if I start to use this on my hair, (which has a mind of its own.)</li>
            <li>Oh I should probably mention that I didn&#x27;t get this product from amazon, I just wanted to share how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>but with this its nice ans shiney</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells nice and earthy, like incense.</li>
            <li>I did not expire nice that.</li>
            <li>Kind of like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have had some luck with dimethicone sprays - they will kind  work for the day they are used</li>
            <li>I liked 10 in 1</li>
            <li>Nice oil but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s seems kind of watery now that I know</li>
            <li>This works just as great as the original Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li>If you have high porosity, you might want to go for the marvelous oil instead.</li>
            <li>Very light even on my fine silver hair, it is great as a leave in after my shampoo and conditioner, and a dab also tames frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Peopleâ€¦meet my new best friend!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fairly good for this price, does a good job to calm the hair</li>
            <li>Its very very strong.</li>
            <li>Nice product and keeps the scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to scent then this is perfect.</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy before but, honestly, it is even stronger and shinier than before.</li>
            <li>It gives nice, healthy and shiny look.</li>
            <li>is THE MOST amazing hair treatment product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Good oil to use on Brazillian HUman hair weave , also add the moroccan shampoo/conditioner , very good products for weave</li>
            <li>Whether I wear my hair straighened or with my natural curls, it always looks healthy, shiny, and smells wonderful because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Awesome for curly hair, maintains moisture in your hair to sustain and define your curls, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, smells pleasant and</li>
            <li>I saw this product advertised in a magazine, and it sounded too good to be true...</li>
            <li>This product does not have a strong fragrance, yet a nice smell that would not affect anyone with or without allergies.affect anyone with or without allergies.</li>
            <li>I have Mediterranean genes, my hair is curlier around the edges, fine, and prone to breakage, but this does a nice job and is not oily if used sparingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this magical stuff for about two days now on a recommendation</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It could just be my hair type, but I am looking for something that will make my hair look more defined.  </li>
            <li>Im buying more morracan hair products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>This product has a nice light fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product.</li>
            <li>Then I put my conditioner on top of it and comb out my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>no matter what i do :)</li>
            <li>but I am glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried many out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products (at all price points), and I can sincerely say this is my #1 favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>The results are outstanding.</li>
            <li>pleased with this product, both the results and the price.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight, but I need help with fly aways.  </li>
            <li>Gives me the Jennifer Lopez/Sandra Bullock polished look :)</li>
            <li>this was helpfull :)</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product on Amazon for my very stretchy hair.</li>
            <li>/frizz on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, too.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>It would work better.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and when i use it before i sleep, it feels good ,and it also smells good</li>
            <li>can actually put quite a bit of this product on my hair and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I had TONS of static.</li>
            <li>I love that the oil brings in shine and de-tangles hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product it leaves my hair soft, and it also smells good!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and effective product!</li>
            <li>But I tried it after my morning shower routine and it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry colored hair.</li>
            <li>I believe after I added this serum, my curls actually dry beautiful waves - not frizz puffs!</li>
            <li>The price is good and it really just makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li>but a lot of it most products for fine hair make my hair look greasy</li>
            <li>easy to use product, love the smell its nice to strong but just right.</li>
            <li>Good for when I wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to see the damage.</li>
            <li>This stuff helps fight against the environment and keeps my hair from breaking off so easily.</li>
            <li>but it gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li>Very mild and non-offensive.  </li>
            <li>but the stench is intolerable, and so strong you wouldn&#x27;t dare wear perfume.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even mind strong medicinal smells, like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair, but it is fine easily breakable hair that will frizz at any sign of rain.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, it makes my hair soft and frizz-free, and it has a healthy shine to it that I rarely ever see.</li>
            <li>With leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d wash on a Sunday, be fine on Monday and Tuesday, but knew that if I had to go out Wednesday, I&#x27;d need another shower on Tuesday night.</li>
            <li>fine at throughout the crown.</li>
            <li>It smelled really cheap, really strong, and just yucky.  </li>
            <li>Since so many people I know have used and are using this product, and have received great results, I would recommend to others for use in their hair regime, if you have dry, fizzy or hair that sometimes becomes affected by humid weather.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that an oil would make my hair greasy and gross looking, but Iâ€™m so happy with the way my hair looks when I use this.</li>
            <li>What it did do, however, was help keep my hair smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>This works so well and smells so fantastic</li>
            <li>People are now realizing that Moroccan Argan Oil is an asset to hair and skin, this product works on different levels for each person, showing great results.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to others who are looking for great results in their hair regime.</li>
            <li>It really makes a nice sheen and seems to be reducing breakage and conditioning over time.</li>
            <li>probably one of the best things about it is that it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your kids.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that tangles, gets greasy/breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER dealt with STATIC cling in my life as I am right now.  </li>
            <li>Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable.  :-)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a happy medium between too dry and too oily and this stuff hits the spot for me.</li>
            <li>Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment for Fizzy Dry Hair is a great product, and referred to me by friends who have been using this product for some time.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I put it on before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I am much more sensitive to fragrance than most people I know, but even my boyfriend who has no problems whatsoever with fragrances thought that the smell of this was egregious.</li>
            <li>Works great for frizzy dry hair</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon isn&#x27;t necessarily the best one, but for the convenience that it offers, this one is a winner in my books.</li>
            <li>Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s such a great product that I&#x27;ll just live with it :)</li>
            <li>â€“ you can bet Iâ€™m trying that idea out right away!</li>
            <li>this smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>The curls popped back out, the frizz went away, and my hair truly shined so bright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for true argan oil, so I will update.</li>
            <li>It works really well and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a nauseatingly sweet combination of cocoa and vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I saw the commercial for this product and it looked so good</li>
            <li>Sure, there is argan oil in it, but not as much.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product for controlling frizz, and the &amp;#34;big puffy hair look&amp;#34;  I have thick hair and this calms it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very concerned about buying this because many reviewers said that when the received their produce the bottled leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love it that much.</li>
            <li>my own is naturally curly/wavy; straightens well.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like sickeningly sweet, chemically floral, expired perfume, and boy does it</li>
            <li>I tried Organix&#x27;s argan oil and loved it - and it also had a more reasonable price, lasting 3 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower my hair detangles quite easily and is already very straight.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to people with fine hair who have bleach damage!</li>
            <li>This is great for conditioning or for anyone that finds other hair oils to be too heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li>sometimes my hair would look great and other times</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t use it often because it make my hair super oily even after  </li>
            <li>She says this is the only Oil that keeps her hair healthy without causing MORE acne.</li>
            <li>apply when it&#x27;s damp, and it leaves my hair super silky non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I was instantly AMAZED not only at the incredibly spicy aroma of the product, but the texture, and what it did for my ENDS!</li>
            <li>This stuff reeks to high heaven with one of the most offensive scents I&#x27;ve ever found in a product.</li>
            <li>The very first day I wore this product in my hair</li>
            <li>But it leaves your hair feeling super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it as much as I do</li>
            <li>This just smells like you put a whole bottle of cheap perfume on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love makes.my hair soo soft</li>
            <li>Body and hair products should be as close to unscented as possible so the user can wear her own scents of choice.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it</li>
            <li>I love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I actually find it to smell really nice.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I used Suave brand Moroccan oil, and prior to using Garnier&#x27;s, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Still, a great product, higher absorption, less product on the hair all day.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t seem to soak in to my daughter&#x27;s super fine hair or really seem to do much for the knots.  </li>
            <li>It works more effectively compared to my pricy pure argan oil product that I used previously.</li>
            <li>The scent is all right and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right?</li>
            <li>Usually right after a shower I pour some onto my hands, rub them together, then pat and rub it into my damp hair.</li>
            <li>I like to use it in the shower right before I put conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who want that sleek smooth hair without the greasy residue.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent, it leaves my wavy, frizzy hair very, very smooth, soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and can make your hair look nice in the short term, but if you are in any way sensitive to fragrance or work in close proximity people who are, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>But, since I started using this, I don&#x27;t have to flat iron very often and my hair feels healthy, tangle free.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty oily, but it seemed to absorb this right away</li>
            <li>Scent is overpowering -- way too strong, and still smells strongly even after it was dry.</li>
            <li>hair is very straight, sleek, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Very nice oil really keeps my hair soft and manageable when I blow dry it .</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my hair shiny and helps with frizz , I prefer agadar product better but for under 5$</li>
            <li>It turned out being too greasy to use on my hair, but for my skin.. it&#x27;s better than baby oil because it actually absorbs, but still leaves them shiny.</li>
            <li>it definitely smooths my hair :)</li>
            <li>Where has this been my whole life!</li>
            <li>Helps with tangles, makes her hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works well at making my hair smooth, soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE!</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and smooth even after blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li>This product not only did that, but more.</li>
            <li>I showered again, shampooed another 7-8 times, and my hair still was sticky and oily - the only thing that got rid of it was using a bar of soap on my hair (twice), and more shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this means they have changed and are better suited for different hair types or what</li>
            <li>and this made it strong enough to style on the first try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only 1 month of daily use, my hair looks gorgeous under the light: shiny, soft and curly!</li>
            <li>Also if you blow dry, a smaller drop to kill off your fly aways.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well as an after shower moisturizer, or to tame the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I use a flat iron most days.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly I did cut off the most damaged part of my hair, but the rest is/was still very damaged prior to use of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Simply put - nothing else comes close to the results I get with this oil, which I find surprising considering the low cost of this</li>
            <li>I recommend this over the real moroccan oil, as i am sure it does the same thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and richer than Suave&#x27;s, and leaves my hair feeling far more soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately though it does not actually seal in moisture, instead it soaks right into the shaft, which is great for conditioning purposes but not all that great for those of us that have hair porous enough to require that conditioning get sealed in.</li>
            <li>Another positive is that my hair is shiny, but that is because this is like an oil serum.</li>
            <li>have thick but fine hair that gets oily very easily.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought this product would make my hair greasy, but it absolutely did not.</li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and soft and light.</li>
            <li>This did NOTHING to control frizz, make it soft or make my wild curly hair, that I always straighten, actually look GOOD curly.</li>
            <li>Please read the ingredients, as I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real morrocan argan oil.</li>
            <li>If you have low to normal porosity, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>If you have course hair make sure that your hair is wet before using preferably after a shower or hot bath.</li>
            <li>I like it and does work on the hair after swimming, but I prefer the 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Sleek Oil works very well, to fight against dry hair or water that has so many chemicals in it that it screws up your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With experiences of product after product failing me, my only hopes were to find a good leave in conditioner/oil that would help with dry hair and frizz.</li>
            <li>I am of Southeast Asian descent and have an oily scalp, as well as very fine, wavy, super dry hair.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve always struggled with frizzy hair and have tried (and reviewed) about a zillion products, and much like I have a go-to moisturizer</li>
            <li>I put this on my freshly washed hair and it leaves my hair soft and manageable without having an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have very bleached hair</li>
            <li>The oil makes the tangles much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>But they always leave my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>Garnier Sleek and Shine is supposed to work as a styling product for straight hair.</li>
            <li>The softness and shine make it well worth a try even if it doesn&#x27;t solve the frizz problem completely.</li>
            <li>I dont have much hair problems except for the frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny, and I really feel like it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my hair silky smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or oily- even when I accidentally use too much, it&#x27;s just an added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>(if you use too much it&#x27;ll look a bit oily)</li>
            <li>If I straighten my hair it holds the straight all day without needing any additional product.</li>
            <li>You will need to experiment with how much product you need for your hair type.</li>
            <li>If you put too much your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It helps loosen my knots and makes my hair much sleaker when air dryed.</li>
            <li>My shipping was fast and all the oil was in its container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop twenty bucks on a hair product that wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this and how cheap it was (as of this writing it should be cheaper to just pick up locally, under five bucks - but prices on Amazon can change) -</li>
            <li>but I think this stuff actually soaks in well enough and stays there well enough that it is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>, i can get my school pictures taken with straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that lingers on.</li>
            <li>Blow-drying and curling does not help much, and using mousse or gel makes it look like helmet</li>
            <li>I LOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>so it can be used really at any time.</li>
            <li>My hair literally stood up straight it was so charged.  </li>
            <li>My hair is kind of in the middle, so I know that people with tougher, curlier hair might not agree with this product, especially if looking for frizz control and volume control.</li>
            <li>Not to say you wont love it, I certainly do not</li>
            <li>When I was able to tame the static it left my hair oily and</li>
            <li>have color treated long wavy hair which tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair, natural or flat ironed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE on 8/16/14 - Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment - I have noticed that my hair is more manageable, stays extremely moisturized throughout the day, without a greasy feel, or appearance.  </li>
            <li>It truly does absorb into the hair, not just coat it like most other oils</li>
            <li>product is like a light massage oil in consistency, only slightly oily, mostly aqueous.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so affordable too, I&#x27;m going back to the store to clean them out</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, where the humidity is high and our summers are steaming hot.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this treatment as it actually has a decent amount of moisturizing oils in it compared to its drugstore brethren.</li>
            <li>And I love that it isn&#x27;t super thick, so it doesn&#x27;t coat your hair your hair and weigh it</li>
            <li>So far I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and easy to work with, and actually helps my styling to last longer.</li>
            <li>Really shines the hair &amp; this bottle lasts a very long time because it takes so very little to achieve great results.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it since it counteracts curling-iron dryness so well.!</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes my dull hair shine and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Their new line of products has really stepped up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have naturally straight hair or don&#x27;t have humid, sticky summers like where I live.</li>
            <li>a quarter size three times a day) because my hair is just that damaged, but it has brought me back to the point that when I test a wet strand when pulling it, it doesn&#x27;t stretch like a rubber band and break, but has some elasticity, which is amazing for hair bleached three times.</li>
            <li>hair is a bit dry on the ends from dying and styling, and this oil makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, the lasting power this stuff would be impressive if it wasn&#x27;t so darn gross.</li>
            <li>Mainly bought it to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more of this product in the future, as well as write another review in a month, after I see what results I have received from this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and this one works better than those.</li>
            <li>I have very fine frizzy hair and this helps to tame it, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it solves the problem.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive for the high quality result.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>i bought it for my cousin who is in high school.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The end result was my hair was less frizzy, and very shiny, healthy looking and soft.</li>
            <li>Make my hair feel soft and keeps the frizz away!!</li>
            <li>, it is truly a dream and it has increased growth like wild fire along with garnier&#x27;s length and strength shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li>Make sure not to use a lot of it though because a little of it gives alot of shine.</li>
            <li>Ohh how it makes my natural hair color shine!!</li>
            <li>do wish this product would come out in little drops because, the first time I used it, a huge glob came out onto my hand.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the price is far, FAR less than my other favorites TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Defining Serum and Moroccanoil Oil Treatment for the same results.</li>
            <li>My hair basically feels like straw when I just use normal shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, and it dries (naturally) looking SO pretty with this.</li>
            <li>The price is better, but it is heavy on the cones.</li>
            <li>I have actually never liked Garnier products, this is the first one I have been pleased with.  </li>
            <li>Not the typical fruity Garnier smell, but more of a soft musk.</li>
            <li>the blow dry didn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve been recommending this product left and right, and I hope you can grab a bottle if you have unruly hair</li>
            <li>The second photo was taken right after the oil was applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new leave in hair conditioner and this is it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy trying new things, and so at times have been tempted to experiment with different products, but continue to always come back to this again and again.</li>
            <li>None of the others have a scent even half as strong.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair very soft and silky feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would on my frizz.</li>
            <li>and my hair is very soft and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>It also makes the skin on my hands very soft as well...</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I have been occasionally adding a little to my conditioner to make for a deeper, more intense conditioning.</li>
            <li>Seems obvious, but it&#x27;s REALLY oily!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping in the coming winter months this stuff will also help prevent the static that winter air usually brings.</li>
            <li>Because this is how you get hair as soft as a unicorns mane!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>now, it was soft and luscious, as if she had stepped out of a salon!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and there is no frizz!</li>
            <li>first time I used it however was the last.  </li>
            <li>This oil makes my blond hair shiny, soft and flexible to handle!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not heavy, not greasy, not oily!</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to straighten my curly hair and keeps it straight when i go outside in high humidity.</li>
            <li>I put it on wet, then put more on dry right before using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My younger daughter has fine hair that tends to dry out and tangle.</li>
            <li>Start with a small amount at your ends and see how it works for you - after a few days of tweaking, you should get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used it also after my twice-a-week washing - on super WET hair, just outta the shower.</li>
            <li>Again, controlled curls, VERY soft ends, soft hair all over, glorified SHINE, and</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and with just that small amount your hair feels more nourished, smoother and altogether more manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on the ends of my hair because I already spritz a light argan oil spray (One n&#x27; Only 12-in-1) into my wet hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft in a way it hasn&#x27;t been since before I used dyes.</li>
            <li>The natural waves are accented and controlled.</li>
            <li>Tames my wild frizzy locks with shine galore to boot.</li>
            <li>, I would apply it after I was completely done straightening my hair to add shine, softness and of course, frizz control.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair, de-tangles any knots and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Do you want hair as soft as a unicorns mane??</li>
            <li>I had read a lot of reviews here before purchasing, and hadn&#x27;t noticed comments along these lines, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>People tell me how shiny and soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>After much research on various products, I came across Garnier&#x27;s sleek and shine.</li>
            <li>Only smells manly, but this Garnier smells so much nicer and pleasanter.</li>
            <li>Most moroccan oils are at least 20 bucks for this size.</li>
            <li>This product far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>When my hair has completely dryed I apply a dime size amout to my ends to help with dryness.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was in an experimental mood</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair immediately soft.</li>
            <li>I get to wear my naturally wavy hair without it looking like I rolled out of bed.</li>
            <li>far, I am a believer.  </li>
            <li>It is natural and allows hair to fall in a sleek and natural way.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of regular application, my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I apply this right after I wring out my wet hair.</li>
            <li>used this product first on my totally dry hair</li>
            <li>Love putting a few drops on my hair after flat ironing it</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 of these and ended up with 2 full bottles, 1 half full bottle and one oily mess.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it absorbed quicker so it didn&#x27;t feel so heavy when first applied.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few months ago and let me just say that it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly/wavy shoulder length highlighted hair that I blow dry and flat iron daily.</li>
            <li>The first photo was taken before the daily application of oil, but the oil is applied daily, and has been for months.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount leaves my hair feeling silky, looking smooth, and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>it works very well for my daughter...who has long curly hair to her waist.</li>
            <li>No matter how much hair treatment I use, my hair has always been dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>right down - adds shine and softness</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s curly right down to my waist.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is very soft, it allows my hair to stay softer and manageable throughout various types of weather.  </li>
            <li>This oil tames both my coarse hair but is light enough not weigh down the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use very much and only put it on my ends, but it made my hair look wet all day.</li>
            <li>I like garnier products generally, and have used leave in conditioners from them before -</li>
            <li>: I have deep brown/black hair that is naturally a light/medium brown.</li>
            <li>I do have some split ends and you can barely notice them when I put this on.</li>
            <li>So far everyone who would notice HAS noticed and keep following me around at work bwahahahaaa</li>
            <li>This comes out fast so you have to be really careful when trying to use it.  </li>
            <li>It smells like vanilla mixed up with old lady..</li>
            <li>I used this....then got back in the shower immediately to try and get this stinky, overpowering old lady perfume out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love garnier products for my thin curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I was still catching whiffs of the oil hours after my shower.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this to anyone who needs shine or their hair is dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and dry and it seems to be more smoother and repaired now that I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li>when i straiten it normally looks like dry crud</li>
            <li>I use it after I shower and it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long term effect.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old straightens her long wavy hair at night AND in the morning.</li>
            <li>and it seems to have returned my hair to normal post-major bleaching (hair tearing off in clumps when wet, etc).</li>
            <li>(I always found their products to leave my thin hair even more flat)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light feeling, not weighted down in the least (and I apply the product quite generously).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m dying my hair a lot, I use a lot of hair-health products, and I LOVE flat-ironing my hair with this on the tips; it makes my hair smell sexy, and since I usually put whatever perfume I&#x27;m wearing in my hair (except my Harvey Prince rollerballs...as it&#x27;s physically impossible, but I roll them at the nape of my neck and below my hair-line...</li>
            <li>I blow dry and then flat iron because I like the extremely straight look flat irons give to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair were dry, but soft and did not have split ends.  </li>
            <li>When dry, hair is shiny, soft and has a bounce to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it in when I get out of the shower, and whether I let my hair air dry or put it up, it controls the frizz and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curly hair (which are pretty long) and keeps them hydrated.  </li>
            <li>While dry and damaged hair is inevitable with that combination, it def keeps my hair feeling soft and hydrated between washes.</li>
            <li>Not only does this make my hair extremely easy to detangle, but it leaves no greasiness behind when it dries.</li>
            <li>I combed her hair (dry) and drizzled a bit of the oil on a fine tooth comb and combed it through, focusing on the bad section to start and then using the same comb to go over the rest of her hair, which just lightly applied whatever was left on the comb.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t require much to work as a little bit of it</li>
            <li>, I focus mainly on the mid section down especially my ends because they are the driest.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky or anything.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> MAKES MY HAIR SMOOTH, SILKY AND SHINY!!!</li>
            <li> My hair looks very nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for controlling fly-aways, but it&#x27;s not the best static reducer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> But if anything I still love CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion the best.</li>
            <li> and my hairdresser is always impressed with how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> Smells nice!  </li>
            <li> Good product, very nice smell and texture.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Does not look like there is oil in the hair and provides good shine</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as good.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m always looking for a good product to help me in my battle with the frizzies.</li>
            <li> good seller, I recommend the article came atiempo 100% recommended</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really good, though I don&#x27;t think this will work on everyone.</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> This is especially effective in humid environment where people don&#x27;t like oil on their hair, because this is really light.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> (I grow it out and donate it to wig companies, so I like to use good stuff on it).</li>
            <li> Im am so happy because now i can go to school with my hair straight without having to worry about it frizzing during the day and best of all</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, but the way it looks, I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> I find it interesting that another reviewer has always been happy with Garnier and is now losing faith in the company -</li>
            <li> It leaves my ends looking very healthy.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal fr what its worth.</li>
            <li> it smeels really nice and can be used for diffent hair styles, for shine, anti-frizz and its a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> Smells very strongly of vanilla, so if you don&#x27;t mind vanilla smell, it is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> It works best for me right after I wash my hair</li>
            <li> Sounds perfect right?</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your hair very nicely, and makes it look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Would love to try an unscented version!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but turns out that I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best part is, you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the effect!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper though, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Super good investment !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly saved me from chopping 3-4&amp;#34; off the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and makes your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> If my hair gets too frizzy, the curls just kind of give out and lose their spirally shape.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product to try and see what results would derive if I start to use this on my hair, (which has a mind of its own.)</li>
            <li> Oh I should probably mention that I didn&#x27;t get this product from amazon, I just wanted to share how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> but with this its nice ans shiney</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it smells nice and earthy, like incense.</li>
            <li> I did not expire nice that.</li>
            <li> Kind of like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have had some luck with dimethicone sprays - they will kind  work for the day they are used</li>
            <li> I liked 10 in 1</li>
            <li> Nice oil but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Suave&#x27;s seems kind of watery now that I know</li>
            <li> This works just as great as the original Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li> If you have high porosity, you might want to go for the marvelous oil instead.</li>
            <li> Very light even on my fine silver hair, it is great as a leave in after my shampoo and conditioner, and a dab also tames frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Peopleâ€¦meet my new best friend!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fairly good for this price, does a good job to calm the hair</li>
            <li> Its very very strong.</li>
            <li> Nice product and keeps the scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to scent then this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair was healthy before but, honestly, it is even stronger and shinier than before.</li>
            <li> It gives nice, healthy and shiny look.</li>
            <li> is THE MOST amazing hair treatment product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Good oil to use on Brazillian HUman hair weave , also add the moroccan shampoo/conditioner , very good products for weave</li>
            <li> Whether I wear my hair straighened or with my natural curls, it always looks healthy, shiny, and smells wonderful because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair, maintains moisture in your hair to sustain and define your curls, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, smells pleasant and</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised in a magazine, and it sounded too good to be true...</li>
            <li> This product does not have a strong fragrance, yet a nice smell that would not affect anyone with or without allergies.affect anyone with or without allergies.</li>
            <li> I have Mediterranean genes, my hair is curlier around the edges, fine, and prone to breakage, but this does a nice job and is not oily if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this magical stuff for about two days now on a recommendation</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It could just be my hair type, but I am looking for something that will make my hair look more defined.  </li>
            <li> Im buying more morracan hair products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not greasy, just healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes her hair grow and she is a lot more confident because if it.  </li>
            <li> Smells much better than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been more and more impressed with Garnier products recently.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice light fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product.</li>
            <li> Then I put my conditioner on top of it and comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> no matter what i do :)</li>
            <li> but I am glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried many out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products (at all price points), and I can sincerely say this is my #1 favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> The results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> pleased with this product, both the results and the price.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight, but I need help with fly aways.  </li>
            <li> Gives me the Jennifer Lopez/Sandra Bullock polished look :)</li>
            <li> this was helpfull :)</li>
            <li> Sure</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon for my very stretchy hair.</li>
            <li> /frizz on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, too.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> It would work better.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and when i use it before i sleep, it feels good ,and it also smells good</li>
            <li> can actually put quite a bit of this product on my hair and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I had TONS of static.</li>
            <li> I love that the oil brings in shine and de-tangles hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product it leaves my hair soft, and it also smells good!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and effective product!</li>
            <li> But I tried it after my morning shower routine and it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry colored hair.</li>
            <li> I believe after I added this serum, my curls actually dry beautiful waves - not frizz puffs!</li>
            <li> The price is good and it really just makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li> but a lot of it most products for fine hair make my hair look greasy</li>
            <li> easy to use product, love the smell its nice to strong but just right.</li>
            <li> Good for when I wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to see the damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps fight against the environment and keeps my hair from breaking off so easily.</li>
            <li> but it gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> Very mild and non-offensive.  </li>
            <li> but the stench is intolerable, and so strong you wouldn&#x27;t dare wear perfume.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even mind strong medicinal smells, like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair, but it is fine easily breakable hair that will frizz at any sign of rain.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it makes my hair soft and frizz-free, and it has a healthy shine to it that I rarely ever see.</li>
            <li> With leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d wash on a Sunday, be fine on Monday and Tuesday, but knew that if I had to go out Wednesday, I&#x27;d need another shower on Tuesday night.</li>
            <li> fine at throughout the crown.</li>
            <li> It smelled really cheap, really strong, and just yucky.  </li>
            <li> Since so many people I know have used and are using this product, and have received great results, I would recommend to others for use in their hair regime, if you have dry, fizzy or hair that sometimes becomes affected by humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that an oil would make my hair greasy and gross looking, but Iâ€™m so happy with the way my hair looks when I use this.</li>
            <li> What it did do, however, was help keep my hair smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> This works so well and smells so fantastic</li>
            <li> People are now realizing that Moroccan Argan Oil is an asset to hair and skin, this product works on different levels for each person, showing great results.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to others who are looking for great results in their hair regime.</li>
            <li> It really makes a nice sheen and seems to be reducing breakage and conditioning over time.</li>
            <li> probably one of the best things about it is that it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your kids.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that tangles, gets greasy/breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER dealt with STATIC cling in my life as I am right now.  </li>
            <li> Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable.  :-)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a happy medium between too dry and too oily and this stuff hits the spot for me.</li>
            <li> Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment for Fizzy Dry Hair is a great product, and referred to me by friends who have been using this product for some time.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I put it on before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I am much more sensitive to fragrance than most people I know, but even my boyfriend who has no problems whatsoever with fragrances thought that the smell of this was egregious.</li>
            <li> Works great for frizzy dry hair</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon isn&#x27;t necessarily the best one, but for the convenience that it offers, this one is a winner in my books.</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s such a great product that I&#x27;ll just live with it :)</li>
            <li> â€“ you can bet Iâ€™m trying that idea out right away!</li>
            <li> this smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> The curls popped back out, the frizz went away, and my hair truly shined so bright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for true argan oil, so I will update.</li>
            <li> It works really well and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a nauseatingly sweet combination of cocoa and vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for this product and it looked so good</li>
            <li> Sure, there is argan oil in it, but not as much.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for controlling frizz, and the &amp;#34;big puffy hair look&amp;#34;  I have thick hair and this calms it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very concerned about buying this because many reviewers said that when the received their produce the bottled leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love it that much.</li>
            <li> my own is naturally curly/wavy; straightens well.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like sickeningly sweet, chemically floral, expired perfume, and boy does it</li>
            <li> I tried Organix&#x27;s argan oil and loved it - and it also had a more reasonable price, lasting 3 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower my hair detangles quite easily and is already very straight.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to people with fine hair who have bleach damage!</li>
            <li> This is great for conditioning or for anyone that finds other hair oils to be too heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> sometimes my hair would look great and other times</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t use it often because it make my hair super oily even after  </li>
            <li> She says this is the only Oil that keeps her hair healthy without causing MORE acne.</li>
            <li> apply when it&#x27;s damp, and it leaves my hair super silky non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I was instantly AMAZED not only at the incredibly spicy aroma of the product, but the texture, and what it did for my ENDS!</li>
            <li> This stuff reeks to high heaven with one of the most offensive scents I&#x27;ve ever found in a product.</li>
            <li> The very first day I wore this product in my hair</li>
            <li> But it leaves your hair feeling super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it as much as I do</li>
            <li> This just smells like you put a whole bottle of cheap perfume on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love makes.my hair soo soft</li>
            <li> Body and hair products should be as close to unscented as possible so the user can wear her own scents of choice.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it</li>
            <li> I love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I actually find it to smell really nice.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I used Suave brand Moroccan oil, and prior to using Garnier&#x27;s, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Still, a great product, higher absorption, less product on the hair all day.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t seem to soak in to my daughter&#x27;s super fine hair or really seem to do much for the knots.  </li>
            <li> It works more effectively compared to my pricy pure argan oil product that I used previously.</li>
            <li> The scent is all right and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right?</li>
            <li> Usually right after a shower I pour some onto my hands, rub them together, then pat and rub it into my damp hair.</li>
            <li> I like to use it in the shower right before I put conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who want that sleek smooth hair without the greasy residue.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent, it leaves my wavy, frizzy hair very, very smooth, soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and can make your hair look nice in the short term, but if you are in any way sensitive to fragrance or work in close proximity people who are, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> But, since I started using this, I don&#x27;t have to flat iron very often and my hair feels healthy, tangle free.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty oily, but it seemed to absorb this right away</li>
            <li> Scent is overpowering -- way too strong, and still smells strongly even after it was dry.</li>
            <li> hair is very straight, sleek, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil really keeps my hair soft and manageable when I blow dry it .</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair shiny and helps with frizz , I prefer agadar product better but for under 5$</li>
            <li> It turned out being too greasy to use on my hair, but for my skin.. it&#x27;s better than baby oil because it actually absorbs, but still leaves them shiny.</li>
            <li> it definitely smooths my hair :)</li>
            <li> Where has this been my whole life!</li>
            <li> Helps with tangles, makes her hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well at making my hair smooth, soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and smooth even after blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li> This product not only did that, but more.</li>
            <li> I showered again, shampooed another 7-8 times, and my hair still was sticky and oily - the only thing that got rid of it was using a bar of soap on my hair (twice), and more shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this means they have changed and are better suited for different hair types or what</li>
            <li> and this made it strong enough to style on the first try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only 1 month of daily use, my hair looks gorgeous under the light: shiny, soft and curly!</li>
            <li> Also if you blow dry, a smaller drop to kill off your fly aways.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well as an after shower moisturizer, or to tame the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I use a flat iron most days.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly I did cut off the most damaged part of my hair, but the rest is/was still very damaged prior to use of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Simply put - nothing else comes close to the results I get with this oil, which I find surprising considering the low cost of this</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the real moroccan oil, as i am sure it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and richer than Suave&#x27;s, and leaves my hair feeling far more soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately though it does not actually seal in moisture, instead it soaks right into the shaft, which is great for conditioning purposes but not all that great for those of us that have hair porous enough to require that conditioning get sealed in.</li>
            <li> Another positive is that my hair is shiny, but that is because this is like an oil serum.</li>
            <li> have thick but fine hair that gets oily very easily.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought this product would make my hair greasy, but it absolutely did not.</li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and soft and light.</li>
            <li> This did NOTHING to control frizz, make it soft or make my wild curly hair, that I always straighten, actually look GOOD curly.</li>
            <li> Please read the ingredients, as I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real morrocan argan oil.</li>
            <li> If you have low to normal porosity, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> If you have course hair make sure that your hair is wet before using preferably after a shower or hot bath.</li>
            <li> I like it and does work on the hair after swimming, but I prefer the 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Sleek Oil works very well, to fight against dry hair or water that has so many chemicals in it that it screws up your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With experiences of product after product failing me, my only hopes were to find a good leave in conditioner/oil that would help with dry hair and frizz.</li>
            <li> I am of Southeast Asian descent and have an oily scalp, as well as very fine, wavy, super dry hair.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve always struggled with frizzy hair and have tried (and reviewed) about a zillion products, and much like I have a go-to moisturizer</li>
            <li> I put this on my freshly washed hair and it leaves my hair soft and manageable without having an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very bleached hair</li>
            <li> The oil makes the tangles much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li> But they always leave my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> Garnier Sleek and Shine is supposed to work as a styling product for straight hair.</li>
            <li> The softness and shine make it well worth a try even if it doesn&#x27;t solve the frizz problem completely.</li>
            <li> I dont have much hair problems except for the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny, and I really feel like it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my hair silky smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or oily- even when I accidentally use too much, it&#x27;s just an added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> (if you use too much it&#x27;ll look a bit oily)</li>
            <li> If I straighten my hair it holds the straight all day without needing any additional product.</li>
            <li> You will need to experiment with how much product you need for your hair type.</li>
            <li> If you put too much your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It helps loosen my knots and makes my hair much sleaker when air dryed.</li>
            <li> My shipping was fast and all the oil was in its container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop twenty bucks on a hair product that wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this and how cheap it was (as of this writing it should be cheaper to just pick up locally, under five bucks - but prices on Amazon can change) -</li>
            <li> but I think this stuff actually soaks in well enough and stays there well enough that it is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> , i can get my school pictures taken with straight hair.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that lingers on.</li>
            <li> Blow-drying and curling does not help much, and using mousse or gel makes it look like helmet</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> so it can be used really at any time.</li>
            <li> My hair literally stood up straight it was so charged.  </li>
            <li> My hair is kind of in the middle, so I know that people with tougher, curlier hair might not agree with this product, especially if looking for frizz control and volume control.</li>
            <li> Not to say you wont love it, I certainly do not</li>
            <li> When I was able to tame the static it left my hair oily and</li>
            <li> have color treated long wavy hair which tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair, natural or flat ironed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE on 8/16/14 - Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment - I have noticed that my hair is more manageable, stays extremely moisturized throughout the day, without a greasy feel, or appearance.  </li>
            <li> It truly does absorb into the hair, not just coat it like most other oils</li>
            <li> product is like a light massage oil in consistency, only slightly oily, mostly aqueous.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so affordable too, I&#x27;m going back to the store to clean them out</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where the humidity is high and our summers are steaming hot.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this treatment as it actually has a decent amount of moisturizing oils in it compared to its drugstore brethren.</li>
            <li> And I love that it isn&#x27;t super thick, so it doesn&#x27;t coat your hair your hair and weigh it</li>
            <li> So far I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and easy to work with, and actually helps my styling to last longer.</li>
            <li> Really shines the hair &amp; this bottle lasts a very long time because it takes so very little to achieve great results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it since it counteracts curling-iron dryness so well.!</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my dull hair shine and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Their new line of products has really stepped up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have naturally straight hair or don&#x27;t have humid, sticky summers like where I live.</li>
            <li> a quarter size three times a day) because my hair is just that damaged, but it has brought me back to the point that when I test a wet strand when pulling it, it doesn&#x27;t stretch like a rubber band and break, but has some elasticity, which is amazing for hair bleached three times.</li>
            <li> hair is a bit dry on the ends from dying and styling, and this oil makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, the lasting power this stuff would be impressive if it wasn&#x27;t so darn gross.</li>
            <li> Mainly bought it to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more of this product in the future, as well as write another review in a month, after I see what results I have received from this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and this one works better than those.</li>
            <li> I have very fine frizzy hair and this helps to tame it, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it solves the problem.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive for the high quality result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> i bought it for my cousin who is in high school.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The end result was my hair was less frizzy, and very shiny, healthy looking and soft.</li>
            <li> Make my hair feel soft and keeps the frizz away!!</li>
            <li> , it is truly a dream and it has increased growth like wild fire along with garnier&#x27;s length and strength shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li> Make sure not to use a lot of it though because a little of it gives alot of shine.</li>
            <li> Ohh how it makes my natural hair color shine!!</li>
            <li> do wish this product would come out in little drops because, the first time I used it, a huge glob came out onto my hand.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the price is far, FAR less than my other favorites TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Defining Serum and Moroccanoil Oil Treatment for the same results.</li>
            <li> My hair basically feels like straw when I just use normal shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, and it dries (naturally) looking SO pretty with this.</li>
            <li> The price is better, but it is heavy on the cones.</li>
            <li> I have actually never liked Garnier products, this is the first one I have been pleased with.  </li>
            <li> Not the typical fruity Garnier smell, but more of a soft musk.</li>
            <li> the blow dry didn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been recommending this product left and right, and I hope you can grab a bottle if you have unruly hair</li>
            <li> The second photo was taken right after the oil was applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new leave in hair conditioner and this is it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying new things, and so at times have been tempted to experiment with different products, but continue to always come back to this again and again.</li>
            <li> None of the others have a scent even half as strong.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair very soft and silky feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would on my frizz.</li>
            <li> and my hair is very soft and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li> It also makes the skin on my hands very soft as well...</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I have been occasionally adding a little to my conditioner to make for a deeper, more intense conditioning.</li>
            <li> Seems obvious, but it&#x27;s REALLY oily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping in the coming winter months this stuff will also help prevent the static that winter air usually brings.</li>
            <li> Because this is how you get hair as soft as a unicorns mane!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> now, it was soft and luscious, as if she had stepped out of a salon!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and there is no frizz!</li>
            <li> first time I used it however was the last.  </li>
            <li> This oil makes my blond hair shiny, soft and flexible to handle!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not heavy, not greasy, not oily!</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to straighten my curly hair and keeps it straight when i go outside in high humidity.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet, then put more on dry right before using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My younger daughter has fine hair that tends to dry out and tangle.</li>
            <li> Start with a small amount at your ends and see how it works for you - after a few days of tweaking, you should get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it also after my twice-a-week washing - on super WET hair, just outta the shower.</li>
            <li> Again, controlled curls, VERY soft ends, soft hair all over, glorified SHINE, and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and with just that small amount your hair feels more nourished, smoother and altogether more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on the ends of my hair because I already spritz a light argan oil spray (One n&#x27; Only 12-in-1) into my wet hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft in a way it hasn&#x27;t been since before I used dyes.</li>
            <li> The natural waves are accented and controlled.</li>
            <li> Tames my wild frizzy locks with shine galore to boot.</li>
            <li> , I would apply it after I was completely done straightening my hair to add shine, softness and of course, frizz control.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair, de-tangles any knots and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Do you want hair as soft as a unicorns mane??</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews here before purchasing, and hadn&#x27;t noticed comments along these lines, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li> People tell me how shiny and soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> After much research on various products, I came across Garnier&#x27;s sleek and shine.</li>
            <li> Only smells manly, but this Garnier smells so much nicer and pleasanter.</li>
            <li> Most moroccan oils are at least 20 bucks for this size.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> When my hair has completely dryed I apply a dime size amout to my ends to help with dryness.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was in an experimental mood</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair immediately soft.</li>
            <li> I get to wear my naturally wavy hair without it looking like I rolled out of bed.</li>
            <li> far, I am a believer.  </li>
            <li> It is natural and allows hair to fall in a sleek and natural way.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of regular application, my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I apply this right after I wring out my wet hair.</li>
            <li> used this product first on my totally dry hair</li>
            <li> Love putting a few drops on my hair after flat ironing it</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these and ended up with 2 full bottles, 1 half full bottle and one oily mess.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it absorbed quicker so it didn&#x27;t feel so heavy when first applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and let me just say that it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly/wavy shoulder length highlighted hair that I blow dry and flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> The first photo was taken before the daily application of oil, but the oil is applied daily, and has been for months.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount leaves my hair feeling silky, looking smooth, and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> it works very well for my daughter...who has long curly hair to her waist.</li>
            <li> No matter how much hair treatment I use, my hair has always been dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> right down - adds shine and softness</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s curly right down to my waist.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is very soft, it allows my hair to stay softer and manageable throughout various types of weather.  </li>
            <li> This oil tames both my coarse hair but is light enough not weigh down the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use very much and only put it on my ends, but it made my hair look wet all day.</li>
            <li> I like garnier products generally, and have used leave in conditioners from them before -</li>
            <li> : I have deep brown/black hair that is naturally a light/medium brown.</li>
            <li> I do have some split ends and you can barely notice them when I put this on.</li>
            <li> So far everyone who would notice HAS noticed and keep following me around at work bwahahahaaa</li>
            <li> This comes out fast so you have to be really careful when trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> It smells like vanilla mixed up with old lady..</li>
            <li> I used this....then got back in the shower immediately to try and get this stinky, overpowering old lady perfume out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love garnier products for my thin curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was still catching whiffs of the oil hours after my shower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this to anyone who needs shine or their hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry and it seems to be more smoother and repaired now that I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> when i straiten it normally looks like dry crud</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower and it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long term effect.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old straightens her long wavy hair at night AND in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it seems to have returned my hair to normal post-major bleaching (hair tearing off in clumps when wet, etc).</li>
            <li> (I always found their products to leave my thin hair even more flat)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light feeling, not weighted down in the least (and I apply the product quite generously).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m dying my hair a lot, I use a lot of hair-health products, and I LOVE flat-ironing my hair with this on the tips; it makes my hair smell sexy, and since I usually put whatever perfume I&#x27;m wearing in my hair (except my Harvey Prince rollerballs...as it&#x27;s physically impossible, but I roll them at the nape of my neck and below my hair-line...</li>
            <li> I blow dry and then flat iron because I like the extremely straight look flat irons give to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were dry, but soft and did not have split ends.  </li>
            <li> When dry, hair is shiny, soft and has a bounce to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it in when I get out of the shower, and whether I let my hair air dry or put it up, it controls the frizz and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curly hair (which are pretty long) and keeps them hydrated.  </li>
            <li> While dry and damaged hair is inevitable with that combination, it def keeps my hair feeling soft and hydrated between washes.</li>
            <li> Not only does this make my hair extremely easy to detangle, but it leaves no greasiness behind when it dries.</li>
            <li> I combed her hair (dry) and drizzled a bit of the oil on a fine tooth comb and combed it through, focusing on the bad section to start and then using the same comb to go over the rest of her hair, which just lightly applied whatever was left on the comb.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t require much to work as a little bit of it</li>
            <li> , I focus mainly on the mid section down especially my ends because they are the driest.</li>
            <li> Then I part it down the middle and put a quarter sized amount on each side (straight hair will need far less).</li>
            <li> other reviews, this oil seems to work better on very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I wash every couple days with non-sulfate shampoo, flat iron occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have thinner, long, wavy blonde, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I have long coarse curlyhair.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t stand it long enough to find out.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t want to completely weigh down my hair).</li>
            <li> I do not like to use leave-in conditioners or styling products; they seem to attract dirt or dust or something and make my hair not shine with all it&#x27;s glory, and it seems to weigh down my natural curls.</li>
            <li> After regular shampoo and conditioning, I pat dry my hair.</li>
            <li> We buy this now on a regular basis for my daughters dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy, no longer dry, and this is the only product (paired with Garnier Fructis Anti-frizz</li>
            <li> but it is not a lasting scent once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for use on your dry ends to help reduce breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But this stuff is so thin and light that I have absolutely no</li>
            <li> For me, I have thick, curly Mediterranean hair and when I put it in my hair wet, once it dried it looked and felt more frizzy and dry!</li>
            <li> FINALLY something that tames my dry frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> There are other Morroccan Argan oils that work just as well, but they are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry hair and this definitely helps a lot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my hair - I use it on my legs to make them silky soft and a little shiny.  </li>
            <li> If left to air dry, my hair becomes dry and frizzy, yech.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I am not a spring chicken, but my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I received compliments on how shiny and pretty my curls looked - they were much neater curls as opposed to crazy curls.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my wet hair, I had similar results.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> before, she would have a strange texture to straightened hair.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are expecting long term effect, like for day, it won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> and I ran through a bottle every two weeks (long hair).  </li>
            <li> Annoyed me all day long when I moved my head and got a fresh whiff of it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a light, flowery and spicy scent, and is subtle and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I actually went out and bought two extra bottles of this oil because I was afraid they would discontinue it like Garnier has a tendency to do! :)</li>
            <li> I use other Garnier Fructis products, especially the sleek and shine serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other oil treatment for my hair, so I&#x27;m not an expert with hair oils.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for something to help me with brushing my very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I like this better than one n only because it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad.</li>
            <li> then I blow dry</li>
            <li> You could use it on your ends for the winter if you get dry ends, or all over your shower - hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair that has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li> This oil allows my hair to dry way faster, which helps eliminate frizz.  </li>
            <li> My hair needs a trim, the ends are dry and have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is always dry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this hair oil proved to be too heavy for my hair, and made it look more greasy than anything.  </li>
            <li> I decided to start using leave in conditioners and letting my hair air dry instead.  </li>
            <li> I use it every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and leave my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> Garnier&#x27;s Fructis Sleek and Shine Moroccan Oil Treatment is a product to add shine and control to unruly, dry, frizzy</li>
            <li> It tames dry or flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I use such a small amount that the bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was using Sunsilk Captivating Curls, but it was taken off the market and is VERY expensive online.  </li>
            <li> hair is normal hair, not dry or greasy, but straight and very thick, very hard to control.  </li>
            <li> tiny bottle...leaves hair way too greasy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting my roots grow out, but the damage of using very harsh developer in my hair for nearly a year beforehand has taken its toll.</li>
            <li> I use this on the ends of my hair where it is dry and it helps a lot!</li>
            <li> Then comb and blow dry!  </li>
            <li> I also tried using it when my hair was wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> It is so inexpensive and I had been previously using only premium hair oils.</li>
            <li> and it would have a shine, would last a long time because it&#x27;s just a few drops</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be applied to dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can apply it while your hair is wet, damp, or totally dry -</li>
            <li> After about 2 hours the smell is super faint.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my wet hair after the shower then blow dry it partially.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of it</li>
            <li> I have just past shoulder length semi- thick curly hair that I flat iron straight about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I think because my hair is so dry, it doesn&#x27;t get me that \\&quot;shine\\&quot; look, but it keeps this crazy hair TAME (sleek) which is more than I can say for all the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li> I put it on my wet hair and go about my day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still  wet.</li>
            <li> I pour a quarter size amount into the palm of my hand and apply it to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Just apply with your fingers to wet hair and comb it through.</li>
            <li> I apply the oil to my brush when I brush my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of Garnier products as I found they left my hair feeling heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> thick oil but not sticky it helps keep your hair soft and resilient after combing/styling</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying,</li>
            <li> Again, I am amazed by this stuff - and all ya need, even for super crazy long hair like mine, is a size of a DIME squirted into your palm - rub it around your hands, and apply to every strand (I avoid the scalp area</li>
            <li> Hair this long usually the curls just straighten out due to the sheer weight; but not mine</li>
            <li> , I use a very small amt of this before I get out of the shower , my hair is really thin and gets weighed down easily .</li>
            <li> After washing, I put a little bit of this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and let it air dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way here.</li>
            <li> Note: a little goes a long way with this oil.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way, even if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I normally apply a small amount after I&#x27;m done drying my hair with a blow dryer, but lately I&#x27;ve been applying it to my wet hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a concoction of other oils.</li>
            <li> The hair also seems to be healthier due to the oil.</li>
            <li> I tried other silicon based leave in conditioners and styling creams.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the organix argan oil, which is a totally different color than this one, so</li>
            <li> I hated wearing my hair down because no matter what I put in my hair it either made my hair look wet and flat and be hard and crunchy all day, or just didn&#x27;t do a good job handling frizz.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if my hair feels especially dry, I will also use this as a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on here, I figured I would be cheap and headed on over to our local CVS and bought this crap in a jar.</li>
            <li> I naturally have very thick, dark hair</li>
            <li> Calms down the frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down to my waist at this point.</li>
            <li> and I can apply tons of it (even to roots) without it getting weighed down or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This tames my curls without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li> Makes hair sleek and silky with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I only wish the bottle weren&#x27;t so small!</li>
            <li> Then I rinse extremely well with hot then cold water.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a better or worst job than a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was understandably hesitant about how putting oil in my hair could make it seem less oily :</li>
            <li> I typically use it after I straighten my hair just to give it some shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the more expensive Moroccan oil and was finding it difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I usually do is while in the shower I shampoo like usual, rinse, apply my conditioner and then this stuff to the ends ONLY while the conditioner is still on there.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews and thought &amp;#34;Well,</li>
            <li> I have long Asian hair but damaged it due to perming and the cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I was wrong about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I usually comb it through wet</li>
            <li> My only disappointment, I wish they would carry this product in a larger size other than 3.75 fl.</li>
            <li> Anyhoo, lately, despite never using any heat or chemicals on my hair and always going au naturale, the ends were feeling dried out and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I will just apply a little of it to the ends of my damp hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when conditioning and a little after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I rub in just a little, avoiding my roots, then comb through.</li>
            <li> It smells a little perfuney in the bottle</li>
            <li> If I am not heat straightening my hair, the ends can look a little oily, but I don&#x27;t use it when I intend to leave my hair curly.  </li>
            <li> So glossy, and a little drop in your hands and worked through your damp hair after you shower will do wonders.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit.</li>
            <li> This little bottle was given to me by my aunt a few days ago.</li>
            <li> my previous hair product, I usually need to use a lot of product to keep my hair somewhat tame but it leaves my curls oily and if I wear my hair down, the oil gets on my face.</li>
            <li> When I put it in already dried it did help with frizz.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed in a few days</li>
            <li> Here in the desert, the water is really harsh.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and once I&#x27;d dried it, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks</li>
            <li> I put it a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> As well as to help tame my puffy ends.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, naturally spirally curly, THICK, unruly, misbehaving, course hair!!!</li>
            <li> Its a little too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> but they are usually quite pricey</li>
            <li> my curly hair usually frizzes up in humid weather when straightened.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my damp hair and work it through the ends.</li>
            <li> And worse, it worked on my hair minimally -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, as it&#x27;s still oil, but it sort of reminds me of Brut but softer.</li>
            <li> she has crazy, unmanageable, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got the course, crazy frizzy stuff, or just need to bring some shiny life back into your hair... try it.</li>
            <li> I have permed, colored curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> argan oil (which I ADORE and is a life saver for hair) that wouldn&#x27;t make your tresses slick and greasy?!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about putting oil in it obviously.</li>
            <li> I stock up when I buy from Amazon as it is almost impossible for me to find locally.</li>
            <li> It was also nearly impossible to wash the oily texture off my hands, so obviously that&#x27;s not something I want on my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my dry hair to tame my frizzies, which was a horrible mistake.</li>
            <li> My hair poofs up at the mere mention of humidity</li>
            <li> Whenever I go outside for a run, it tangles horribly.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive</li>
            <li> I have to wash it ever day, without fail.</li>
            <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be using it anymore because of this.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference I noticed was that it temporarily re-hydrates my dry ends so that they don&#x27;t get tangled terribly while running/cycling.</li>
            <li> if I hate it, at least, I will not be out $30.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind some fragrance, but this stinks.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been thick and frizzy, but dye damage brought that out in a very bad way :</li>
            <li> I was scared to use it because of how bad it smelled</li>
            <li> I hate perfume</li>
            <li> I realized that I hated the smell I wanted to throw it out, but it seemed wasteful to just toss it because of its fragrance.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day (an awful hair day at work!)</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Its awful.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair was even worst looking then</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product feels so oily that you don&#x27;t want any of your hair to touch your face</li>
            <li> So far I like this pretty well. I have been occasionally adding a little to my conditioner to make for a deeper, more intense conditioning. Sometimes if my hair feels especially dry, I will also use this as a leave-in treatment. I will just apply a little of it to the ends of my damp hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is always on my shelf! Very light even on my fine silver hair, it is great as a leave in after my shampoo and conditioner, and a dab also tames frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li> this smells amazing and makes my hair super soft! I use it after i shower as a hair dangler and softener..works so well! must buy!</li>
            <li> Calms down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable.  :-)</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fairly good for this price, does a good job to calm the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this magical stuff for about two days now on a recommendation and it seems to have returned my hair to normal post-major bleaching (hair tearing off in clumps when wet, etc). I have been using a lot compared to the recommendations (ex. a quarter size three times a day) because my hair is just that damaged, but it has brought me back to the point that when I test a wet strand when pulling it, it doesn&#x27;t stretch like a rubber band and break, but has some elasticity, which is amazing for hair bleached three times. Admittedly I did cut off the most damaged part of my hair, but the rest is/was still very damaged prior to use of this stuff. I would highly recommend this product to people with fine hair who have bleach damage! It works more effectively compared to my pricy pure argan oil product that I used previously.</li>
            <li> tiny bottle...leaves hair way too greasy and weighted down. Tossed it.</li>
            <li> easy to use product, love the smell its nice to strong but just right.</li>
            <li> Peopleâ€¦meet my new best friend! Iâ€™ve always struggled with frizzy hair and have tried (and reviewed) about a zillion products, and much like I have a go-to moisturizer, I now have a go-to hair product. Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment is a must when I get out of the shower. I was worried that an oil would make my hair greasy and gross looking, but Iâ€™m so happy with the way my hair looks when I use this. The smell is great, it makes my hair soft and frizz-free, and it has a healthy shine to it that I rarely ever see. Iâ€™ve been recommending this product left and right, and I hope you can grab a bottle if you have unruly hair â€“ itâ€™s quite inexpensive! I was looking through the reviews and one gal says she even uses some mixed in with her conditioner when she showers â€“ you can bet Iâ€™m trying that idea out right away!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well as an after shower moisturizer, or to tame the frizzies.  Smells very strongly of vanilla, so if you don&#x27;t mind vanilla smell, it is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Really shines the hair &amp; this bottle lasts a very long time because it takes so very little to achieve great results. Inexpensive for the high quality result.</li>
            <li> Love makes.my hair soo soft</li>
            <li> Love this product. Ordering again. Just the oil i was looking for to apply on hair day or night.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a leave-in style.  I put it on my wet hair and go about my day.  It does leave my hair very soft and silky feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would on my frizz. It could just be my hair type, but I am looking for something that will make my hair look more defined.  I was using Sunsilk Captivating Curls, but it was taken off the market and is VERY expensive online.  I am still looking, so if anyone has any ideas please let me know.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry and it seems to be more smoother and repaired now that I&#x27;ve used this. Im buying more morracan hair products.</li>
            <li> Mainly bought it to use it in the shower. Was unimpressed with it. Didn&#x27;t do a better or worst job than a regular conditioner. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair, natural or flat ironed.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were dry, but soft and did not have split ends.  I thought this would help but after using it the ends of my hair looked fried and I had split ends, I read the ingredients and saw that it had alcohol in it, no wonder.</li>
            <li> I was understandably hesitant about how putting oil in my hair could make it seem less oily :P. However, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My background: I have deep brown/black hair that is naturally a light/medium brown. It&#x27;s down to my waist at this point. I&#x27;m letting my roots grow out, but the damage of using very harsh developer in my hair for nearly a year beforehand has taken its toll. My hair basically feels like straw when I just use normal shampoos/conditioners. It&#x27;s easy to see the damage. My hair has always been thick and frizzy, but dye damage brought that out in a very bad way :x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been swapping between leave-in conditioners for a couple years now, almost always coming back to Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine. With leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d wash on a Sunday, be fine on Monday and Tuesday, but knew that if I had to go out Wednesday, I&#x27;d need another shower on Tuesday night. That put me at 3 showers per week, which isn&#x27;t so great on color treated hair :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff, I wash my hair Sunday night, put it in, and then my hair looks awesome Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It&#x27;s soft in a way it hasn&#x27;t been since before I used dyes. Sometimes I can even get a Thursday out of it before needing to shower again. I use two squeezes of about a nickle-sized amount of oil and rub it into my palms/fingers so that I can rub it into my hair. My hair is naturally wavy, and it dries (naturally) looking SO pretty with this. The natural waves are accented and controlled. It&#x27;s honestly saved me from chopping 3-4&amp;#34; off the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product it leaves my hair soft, and it also smells good!</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil! I typically use it after I straighten my hair just to give it some shine. It doesnt leave hair looking oily at all. It absorbs into your hair very nicely, and makes it look so healthy. You only need a little of it so it lasts very long. I never put it above my ears. I do have some split ends and you can barely notice them when I put this on. It has a wonderful scent to it. I&#x27;ve also tried putting it in my conditioner, and as a leave in. Overall, it works great!</li>
            <li> LOVE-LOVE-LOVE! I&#x27;ve been buying the more expensive Moroccan oil and was finding it difficult to find. So I saw a review in a mag  and decided to try. Like gold this oil is to me. Tames my wild frizzy locks with shine galore to boot. I&#x27;m a FAN!</li>
            <li> I have mid back length kinky curly 3c/4a hair. This stuff really makes my dull hair shine and smells amazing. It works best for me right after I wash my hair and it&#x27;s still  wet. Then I part it down the middle and put a quarter sized amount on each side (straight hair will need far less). I only wish the bottle weren&#x27;t so small! Garnier should make this in a much larger size, but it has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; serum. Best of all, the price is far, FAR less than my other favorites TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Defining Serum and Moroccanoil Oil Treatment for the same results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I live in Florida, where the humidity is high and our summers are steaming hot. At first glance, I thought this product would make my hair greasy, but it absolutely did not. What it did do, however, was help keep my hair smooth and tangle-free. The biggest difference I noticed was that it temporarily re-hydrates my dry ends so that they don&#x27;t get tangled terribly while running/cycling. The scent is all right and not overpowering. I normally apply a small amount after I&#x27;m done drying my hair with a blow dryer, but lately I&#x27;ve been applying it to my wet hair then I blow dry and I&#x27;ve had wonderful results with a gorgeous shine.</li>
            <li> Best hair oil ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> I put this on my freshly washed hair and it leaves my hair soft and manageable without having an oily feeling. It works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair, maintains moisture in your hair to sustain and define your curls, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, smells pleasant and probably one of the best things about it is that it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your kids. Also doesn&#x27;t require much to work as a little bit of it goes a long way. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This works so well and smells so fantastic I started putting it on pulse points as a perfume XD&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m dying my hair a lot, I use a lot of hair-health products, and I LOVE flat-ironing my hair with this on the tips; it makes my hair smell sexy, and since I usually put whatever perfume I&#x27;m wearing in my hair (except my Harvey Prince rollerballs...as it&#x27;s physically impossible, but I roll them at the nape of my neck and below my hair-line...so I had the great idea that since this just smells awesome and my hair already smells like it to just wear it as a perfume, as I wear oil perfume quite a bit. So far everyone who would notice HAS noticed and keep following me around at work bwahahahaaa</li>
            <li> Seems obvious, but it&#x27;s REALLY oily!</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price , I use a very small amt of this before I get out of the shower , my hair is really thin and gets weighed down easily . Definitely makes my hair shiny and helps with frizz , I prefer agadar product better but for under 5$ this is a very good substitute .</li>
            <li> Please read the ingredients, as I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real morrocan argan oil. It&#x27;s a concoction of other oils. For me, I have thick, curly Mediterranean hair and when I put it in my hair wet, once it dried it looked and felt more frizzy and dry! When I put it in already dried it did help with frizz. But if anything I still love CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion the best. For those looking for a heat protectant it&#x27;s way better. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for true argan oil, so I will update. But as for this product, I&#x27;d recommend another brand. You get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> I bought this #1, because of all the raving reviews on here and #2, because I had a coupon. Not to say you wont love it, I certainly do not but everyone&#x27;s hair responds differently. I have just past shoulder length semi- thick curly hair that I flat iron straight about 2-3 times a week. That&#x27;s when I used this stuff. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right? I don&#x27;t know, I would apply it after I was completely done straightening my hair to add shine, softness and of course, frizz control. Its a little too thick for my liking. By the end of the day, my hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed in a few days and I had a lot of build-up. I guess I need something lighter.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It smells so good and makes your hair smooth and shiny! This is a must have! I have very bleached hair and this made it strong enough to style on the first try! It&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li> Best product of its kind for the money!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Not too shiny.</li>
            <li> My younger daughter has fine hair that tends to dry out and tangle. We use this oil to brush out her hair. The oil makes the tangles much easier to comb out. The hair also seems to be healthier due to the oil. The first photo was taken before the daily application of oil, but the oil is applied daily, and has been for months. The second photo was taken right after the oil was applied. The third photo was also taken after the oil was applied.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that tangles, gets greasy/breaks very easily. This stuff is awesome! Having greasy hair I was very skeptical about putting oil in it obviously. But this stuff is so thin and light that I have absolutely no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I usually do is while in the shower I shampoo like usual, rinse, apply my conditioner and then this stuff to the ends ONLY while the conditioner is still on there. Then I rinse extremely well with hot then cold water. I do not apply it to my bangs or roots at all. That would make me greaseball city. When I get out of the shower my hair detangles quite easily and is already very straight. I blow dry and then flat iron because I like the extremely straight look flat irons give to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very straight, sleek, silky, and shiny. I&#x27;m hoping in the coming winter months this stuff will also help prevent the static that winter air usually brings. I actually went out and bought two extra bottles of this oil because I was afraid they would discontinue it like Garnier has a tendency to do! :)</li>
            <li> I was not much of fan of Garnier hair products but am pleasantly surprised by this one. I have permed, colored curly thick hair. No matter how much hair treatment I use, my hair has always been dry and tangled. I tried other silicon based leave in conditioners and styling creams. But they always leave my hair very greasy. Garnier Sleek and Shine is supposed to work as a styling product for straight hair. I take a chance and it works wonders for me. After regular shampoo and conditioning, I pat dry my hair. Put a quarter size of the oil in my palms and run my fingers through my damp hair from mid shaft to ends. It conditions my hair, de-tangles any knots and leaves my hair soft and silky. The best part is that it leaves no residue. My hair is not greasy, just healthy.</li>
            <li> This comes out fast so you have to be really careful when trying to use it.  It works really well and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my hair - I use it on my legs to make them silky soft and a little shiny.  It turned out being too greasy to use on my hair, but for my skin.. it&#x27;s better than baby oil because it actually absorbs, but still leaves them shiny.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Garnier&#x27;s products, and this is no exception. The Moroccan oil did wonders on my hair and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil works very well, to fight against dry hair or water that has so many chemicals in it that it screws up your hair.  Here in the desert, the water is really harsh.  This stuff helps fight against the environment and keeps my hair from breaking off so easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter, age 10 has a ton of hair and needs product, so tried this and she loooves the way it makes her hair smell and feel!</li>
            <li> this is a MUST in my life!  it definitely smooths my hair :)</li>
            <li> Do you want hair as soft as a unicorns mane?? Because this is how you get hair as soft as a unicorns mane!</li>
            <li> This is great for conditioning or for anyone that finds other hair oils to be too heavy/greasy. Unfortunately though it does not actually seal in moisture, instead it soaks right into the shaft, which is great for conditioning purposes but not all that great for those of us that have hair porous enough to require that conditioning get sealed in. If you have low to normal porosity, you&#x27;ll love this. If you have high porosity, you might want to go for the marvelous oil instead. Btw,  this is absolutely awesome for babies with curly hair!</li>
            <li> Scent is overpowering -- way too strong, and still smells strongly even after it was dry. Annoyed me all day long when I moved my head and got a fresh whiff of it. I have been buying a variety of products for dry/frizzy hair to experiment and compare, and have found some I&#x27;ve been really happy with. None of the others have a scent even half as strong. I had read a lot of reviews here before purchasing, and hadn&#x27;t noticed comments along these lines, which surprised me. Would love to try an unscented version!</li>
            <li> I like this product but i don&#x27;t use it often because it make my hair super oily even after  I wash it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and makes my hair really soft. I have fine thin hair and I can apply tons of it (even to roots) without it getting weighed down or oily feeling. Where has this been my whole life!</li>
            <li> Takes my frizzes away!  I use this on the ends of my hair where it is dry and it helps a lot!</li>
            <li> This works great on my mom&#x27;s hair.  It makes her hair grow and she is a lot more confident because if it.  If you have an elderly citizen in your household I&#x27;d recommend trying this product on their hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for controlling fly-aways, but it&#x27;s not the best static reducer I&#x27;ve ever used. The best I&#x27;ve ever used is Redken #6. That stuff amazes me.</li>
            <li> I stock up when I buy from Amazon as it is almost impossible for me to find locally. I get my hair dyed once a month and my hairdresser is always impressed with how healthy my hair is. And I always get compliments on my hair from strangers on how beautiful it is. I am not a spring chicken, but my hair is shiny and healthy. This product is definitely a contributing factor in that!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair sooo soft. You could use it on your ends for the winter if you get dry ends, or all over your shower - hair. I even put it in my conditioner sometimes. People tell me how shiny and soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> Smells much better than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; stuff. We buy this now on a regular basis for my daughters dry hair. Helps with tangles, makes her hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!  I have dry curly hair that has a tendency to frizz.  After washing, I put a little bit of this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and let it air dry and my hair is very soft and not frizzy at all.  It also makes the skin on my hands very soft as well...</li>
            <li> Nice product and keeps the scalp healthy. Does not look like there is oil in the hair and provides good shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been more and more impressed with Garnier products recently.  They seem to be stepping it up.  I found this in my cabinet, probably a sister purchase, but I decided to try it since I was running low on after-shower hair products.  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I was wrong about this stuff.  I usually go for the organix argan oil, which is a totally different color than this one, so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as good.  BUT IT IS.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curly hair (which are pretty long) and keeps them hydrated.  If my hair gets too frizzy, the curls just kind of give out and lose their spirally shape.  This oil allows my hair to dry way faster, which helps eliminate frizz.  The product also didn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or feel greasy to the touch.  There&#x27;s a happy medium between too dry and too oily and this stuff hits the spot for me.</li>
            <li> Works well at making my hair smooth, soft and adds shine. I have very fine frizzy hair and this helps to tame it, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it solves the problem. I use it when conditioning and a little after I get out of the shower. Smells so great! The softness and shine make it well worth a try even if it doesn&#x27;t solve the frizz problem completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally while waiting for my Amazon order for a different product to arrive.  The  Garnier product seems to work okay but the stench is intolerable, and so strong you wouldn&#x27;t dare wear perfume.  It seems to be a nauseatingly sweet combination of cocoa and vanilla.  Body and hair products should be as close to unscented as possible so the user can wear her own scents of choice.  Definitely will not use again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth! I apply it on my wet hair after the shower then blow dry it partially. It feels like silk the next morning. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and effective product! A little goes a long way here. Usually right after a shower I pour some onto my hands, rub them together, then pat and rub it into my damp hair. Works well as a detangler and leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after hearing all the buzz about Moroccan oil. I have fine, naturally curly/wavy shoulder length highlighted hair that I blow dry and flat iron daily. My hair poofs up at the mere mention of humidity, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good product to help me in my battle with the frizzies. I have to say, this product has surpassed my expectations! Just a small amount leaves my hair feeling silky, looking smooth, and not at all greasy. Note: a little goes a long way with this oil. I rub in just a little, avoiding my roots, then comb through. It smells great, too! Not the typical fruity Garnier smell, but more of a soft musk. I definitely recommend giving this oil a try.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding this product in my local stores, so this may be discontinued soon.  I bought 6 bottles via Amazon just in case!  There are other Morroccan Argan oils that work just as well, but they are much more expensive.  This is a wonderful dupe for those high-end versions, in my opinion.  I pour a quarter size amount into the palm of my hand and apply it to my wet hair. Then comb and blow dry!  It does not leave my hair oily at all.  After a few days of regular application, my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It works well on dry/curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice light fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy. A little bit of this goes a long way, even if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment for Fizzy Dry Hair is a great product, and referred to me by friends who have been using this product for some time.  The delivery was on time, packaging was very good.  I have purchased this product to try and see what results would derive if I start to use this on my hair, (which has a mind of its own.) Since so many people I know have used and are using this product, and have received great results, I would recommend to others for use in their hair regime, if you have dry, fizzy or hair that sometimes becomes affected by humid weather.  People are now realizing that Moroccan Argan Oil is an asset to hair and skin, this product works on different levels for each person, showing great results.  I would definitely purchase more of this product in the future, as well as write another review in a month, after I see what results I have received from this product.  Again, Garnier a product and name you can always trust. My only disappointment, I wish they would carry this product in a larger size other than 3.75 fl. ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 8/16/14 - Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Sleek Oil Treatment - I have noticed that my hair is more manageable, stays extremely moisturized throughout the day, without a greasy feel, or appearance.  You would only need a nickel size amount when applying to your hair, as it is concentrated.  It definitely moisturizes the hair, and fights against \\&quot;fizzy\\&quot; hair in humid weather.  It is an excellent oil to use when blow drying your hair. It provides great conditioning for the hair without the greasy appearance, feel or residue.  Although my hair is very soft, it allows my hair to stay softer and manageable throughout various types of weather.  I would definitely recommend to others who are looking for great results in their hair regime. My scalp always feels moist regardless of humidity in the weather.  This product does not have a strong fragrance, yet a nice smell that would not affect anyone with or without allergies.affect anyone with or without allergies.</li>
            <li> Have only used once and found a 70% reduction in frizz. I dont have much hair problems except for the frizz. After much research on various products, I came across Garnier&#x27;s sleek and shine. I thot of giving it a try and I dont think I am changing it anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting the results I got now. My hair needs a trim, the ends are dry and have color treated hair. Whenever I go outside for a run, it tangles horribly. I wash every couple days with non-sulfate shampoo, flat iron occasionally. But, since I started using this, I don&#x27;t have to flat iron very often and my hair feels healthy, tangle free. It&#x27;s glossy and not at all oily looking. The scent is ok, but the way it looks, I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> it works very well for my daughter...who has long curly hair to her waist. we use it for manageability and hair lustre.it also controls frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Make my hair feel soft and keeps the frizz away!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these and ended up with 2 full bottles, 1 half full bottle and one oily mess. Bottles are not sealed.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. While I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent, it leaves my wavy, frizzy hair very, very smooth, soft and super shiny. I don&#x27;t even need to use a dryer or a straightening iron, which is a big deal for me. A little bit goes a long way. Just apply with your fingers to wet hair and comb it through. Absolutely worth it, I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product. I tried a fructis product ages ago and I didn&#x27;t like it. I saw the commercial for this product and it looked so good I decided it was time to give fructis another try. I&#x27;m happy I did. My hair is so shiny, and I really feel like it conditions my hair. My hair looks very nice. I like to use it in the shower right before I put conditioner in my hair, I focus mainly on the mid section down especially my ends because they are the driest. Then I put my conditioner on top of it and comb out my hair. The end result was my hair was less frizzy, and very shiny, healthy looking and soft. I&#x27;d say the product works just like it says it will. I&#x27;m am very happy with this product and will keep buying it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new leave in hair conditioner and this is it. Oh I should probably mention that I didn&#x27;t get this product from amazon, I just wanted to share how much I liked it. And the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a massage oil for my scalp and I gotta tell you, it is truly a dream and it has increased growth like wild fire along with garnier&#x27;s length and strength shampoo and conditioner!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I like it and does work on the hair after swimming, but I prefer the 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower and it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long term effect.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my hair silky smooth and shiny but it stays that way longer between washings.  It is not at all greasy.  And it is so inexpensive.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great after showering and before heating</li>
            <li> good seller, I recommend the article came atiempo 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I have long Asian hair but damaged it due to perming and the cold, dry weather. Hair is frizzy, tangled and unmanageable if not for this. I apply it on damp hair. It helps with detangling. When dry, hair is shiny, soft and has a bounce to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 1 month of daily use, my hair looks gorgeous under the light: shiny, soft and curly!</li>
            <li> I naturally have very thick, dark hair and I bleach it once a month to get myself to a platinum blonde level, and this product makes it look so sleek and shiny! I love it. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily- even when I accidentally use too much, it&#x27;s just an added shine to my hair. And I love that it isn&#x27;t super thick, so it doesn&#x27;t coat your hair your hair and weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have for any hair type, I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> fizzy curly hair and when i straiten it normally looks like dry crud lol but with this its nice ans shiney no matter what i do :)</li>
            <li> I like this better than one n only because it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad. One n Only smells manly, but this Garnier smells so much nicer and pleasanter. It&#x27;s hard to describe, as it&#x27;s still oil, but it sort of reminds me of Brut but softer. It left my hair smooth and soft and light. The smell didn&#x27;t linger. The price is better, but it is heavy on the cones. Sure, there is argan oil in it, but not as much. Still, a great product, higher absorption, less product on the hair all day. So it&#x27;s really good, though I don&#x27;t think this will work on everyone. My hair is kind of in the middle, so I know that people with tougher, curlier hair might not agree with this product, especially if looking for frizz control and volume control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years. It smells good and I like the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry colored hair. REALLY WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> FINALLY something that tames my dry frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I have course-ish hair. My hair is always dry but it gets greasy easily. I love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny. Make sure not to use a lot of it though because a little of it gives alot of shine. I highly recommended this to anyone who needs shine or their hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I must have to say, it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel wonderful but the scent is.. Not desirable.. It smells like vanilla mixed up with old lady.. I was scared to use it because of how bad it smelled but I am glad I tried it.  You only need A TINY BIT (if you use too much it&#x27;ll look a bit oily) the good news is the smell doesn&#x27;t linger! It goes away in like 10 minutes or when your hair finishes drying! (You can only smell it a tiny bit after that) But it leaves your hair feeling super soft and healthy. I will not buy again only because of the scent but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to scent then this is perfect.</li>
            <li> it works just not as well as i thought it would. i bought it for my sons hair, makes it softer but does not help with his frizz.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my dry hair to tame my frizzies, which was a horrible mistake. I didn&#x27;t use very much and only put it on my ends, but it made my hair look wet all day. It was also nearly impossible to wash the oily texture off my hands, so obviously that&#x27;s not something I want on my hair. When I used it on my wet hair, I had similar results.&lt;br /&gt;From other reviews, this oil seems to work better on very thick hair. I have thinner, long, wavy blonde, dyed hair. On the plus side, it smells nice and earthy, like incense.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  Can&#x27;t live without it since it counteracts curling-iron dryness so well.!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  I have long coarse curlyhair. I use this with a leave in conditioner and a finishing spray and my hair looks great. These produproducts are great but you have to use them together.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I have very fine hair but a lot of it most products for fine hair make my hair look greasy this did not. It made my hair soft and smooth even after blow drying and straightening it. The price is great! Most moroccan oils are at least 20 bucks for this size. I would highly recommend this for anyone who want that sleek smooth hair without the greasy residue.</li>
            <li> BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER! MAKES MY HAIR SMOOTH, SILKY AND SHINY!!! BEST OIL I HAVE EVER USED! WILL REPURCHASE AND I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!!</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations. I have mid-length curly hair - and it was frizzy! I hated wearing my hair down because no matter what I put in my hair it either made my hair look wet and flat and be hard and crunchy all day, or just didn&#x27;t do a good job handling frizz. It was always a hit or miss - sometimes my hair would look great and other times I could do the same thing and my hair would be all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With experiences of product after product failing me, my only hopes were to find a good leave in conditioner/oil that would help with dry hair and frizz. This product not only did that, but more. After only one use my hair was noticeably different. The very first day I wore this product in my hair I received compliments on how shiny and pretty my curls looked - they were much neater curls as opposed to crazy curls. My hair is no longer frizzy, no longer dry, and this is the only product (paired with Garnier Fructis Anti-frizz serum)that I use in my hair (no hairspray, gel, mousse, etc!). I put it in when I get out of the shower, and whether I let my hair air dry or put it up, it controls the frizz and leaves my hair soft and shiny. If I straighten my hair it holds the straight all day without needing any additional product. Whether I wear my hair straighened or with my natural curls, it always looks healthy, shiny, and smells wonderful because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 warning, and it has nothing to do with the product, which is why I gave it 5 stars: obviously this is an oil. You will need to experiment with how much product you need for your hair type. If you put too much your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for controlling frizz, and the &amp;#34;big puffy hair look&amp;#34;  I have thick hair and this calms it right down - adds shine and softness - go ahead and get it !! What an awesome price point too! Hope you enjoy it as much as I doâ€¦â€¦.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I have tried many out there. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to use. Just dime size is great. This oil has save my hair. I have very frizzy hair and this has resolved that issue. It looks like in the salon hair. I would buy again and agin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised! my hair is pretty oily, but it seemed to absorb this right away and it just leaves it perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for something to help me with brushing my very long hair. As well as to help tame my puffy ends. I apply the oil to my brush when I brush my wet hair. It helps loosen my knots and makes my hair much sleaker when air dryed. When my hair has completely dryed I apply a dime size amout to my ends to help with dryness. My hair is noticeably smoother and softer after using this hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very concerned about buying this because many reviewers said that when the received their produce the bottled leaked everywhere. I did not expire nice that. My shipping was fast and all the oil was in its container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern I had was that I would not like them smell of this product. I actually find it to smell really nice. After about 2 hours the smell is super faint. Kind of like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product. My only wish is that it absorbed quicker so it didn&#x27;t feel so heavy when first applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products (at all price points), and I can sincerely say this is my #1 favorite hair product. I enjoy trying new things, and so at times have been tempted to experiment with different products, but continue to always come back to this again and again. Simply put - nothing else comes close to the results I get with this oil, which I find surprising considering the low cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated long wavy hair which tends to tangle easily. After washing/conditioning I apply this generously to my damp hair and comb through. Not only does this make my hair extremely easy to detangle, but it leaves no greasiness behind when it dries. The finished result is silky detangled hair that appears to have no product in it - it&#x27;s very light feeling, not weighted down in the least (and I apply the product quite generously). It truly does absorb into the hair, not just coat it like most other oils I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally plan to stockpile this product out of fear it may someday be discontinued. I love it that much.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and its not that expensive. This tames my curls without weighing it down at all. Very happy with it. would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> it smeels really nice and can be used for diffent hair styles, for shine, anti-frizz and its a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> I am of Southeast Asian descent and have an oily scalp, as well as very fine, wavy, super dry hair. I only used the oil on the tips of my hair.  I also tried using it when my hair was wet and dry.  Unfortunately, this hair oil proved to be too heavy for my hair, and made it look more greasy than anything.  It may work well for others, but it simply did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> I love garnier products for my thin curly frizzy hair. This item arrived open all over my package What a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a handful if you have course or &amp;#34;black people&amp;#34; hair....., If you have course hair make sure that your hair is wet before using preferably after a shower or hot bath. The results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. I used this on my hair and once I&#x27;d dried it, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks, it was that greasy, oily, and sticky. I got back in the shower, washed my hair probably another 4-5 times, to no avail. At the end of the day (an awful hair day at work!) I showered again, shampooed another 7-8 times, and my hair still was sticky and oily - the only thing that got rid of it was using a bar of soap on my hair (twice), and more shampoo. I&#x27;m throwing the rest of it away. AWFUL.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I put it on while my hair is wet after towel drying before using the Remington wet to straight straightener.  It really makes a nice sheen and seems to be reducing breakage and conditioning over time. It smells a little perfuney in the bottle but it is not a lasting scent once my hair is dry. If I am not heat straightening my hair, the ends can look a little oily, but I don&#x27;t use it when I intend to leave my hair curly.  I have Mediterranean genes, my hair is curlier around the edges, fine, and prone to breakage, but this does a nice job and is not oily if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> It is so inexpensive and I had been previously using only premium hair oils. I read the previous reviews and thought &amp;#34;Well, if I hate it, at least, I will not be out $30. What do I have to lose?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received and tried it, I was ashamed that I had been such a product snob - it&#x27;s great! My hair was healthy before but, honestly, it is even stronger and shinier than before. My stylist is wowed by how great my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try. Start with a small amount at your ends and see how it works for you - after a few days of tweaking, you should get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal info - my own is naturally curly/wavy; straightens well. Texture is fairly coarse at the nape; fine at throughout the crown. This oil tames both my coarse hair but is light enough not weigh down the rest of my hair. Good for when I wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters is prone to developing a dreadlock on the back of her head that would put Bob Marley to shame.  We have had some luck with dimethicone sprays - they will kind  work for the day they are used and then you are back to rasta-style the next morning.  I have tried jojoba oil which which people rave about but it just didn&#x27;t seem to soak in to my daughter&#x27;s super fine hair or really seem to do much for the knots.  I wanted to give one of the argan oils a try but they are usually quite pricey and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop twenty bucks on a hair product that wouldn&#x27;t work.  When I saw this and how cheap it was (as of this writing it should be cheaper to just pick up locally, under five bucks - but prices on Amazon can change) - I figured eh, we&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this I combed her hair (dry) and drizzled a bit of the oil on a fine tooth comb and combed it through, focusing on the bad section to start and then using the same comb to go over the rest of her hair, which just lightly applied whatever was left on the comb.  It did look oily initially but it soaked in over the next half-hour or so leaving her with shiny, slippery, untangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that hair is dead and as such you can&#x27;t really \\&quot;repair\\&quot; it but I think this stuff actually soaks in well enough and stays there well enough that it is the next best thing.  We actually see a day to day reduction in tangles with this product, vs. same-day only results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product, both the results and the price.  I find it interesting that another reviewer has always been happy with Garnier and is now losing faith in the company - I have actually never liked Garnier products, this is the first one I have been pleased with.  I don&#x27;t know if this means they have changed and are better suited for different hair types or what (I always found their products to leave my thin hair even more flat) but I am definitely a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  i bought it for my cousin who is in high school.  she has crazy, unmanageable, coarse, wavy hair.  we bought the sleek n shine shampoo and conditioner as well.  after using all three of the products, her hair was noticeably softer and easier to style.  after we straightened it, we couldn&#x27;t believe that it was the same hair.  before, she would have a strange texture to straightened hair.  now, it was soft and luscious, as if she had stepped out of a salon! no need to think about this product.  just go and try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I like this hair oil. It definite hold wells on my hair and keep that shine as well as condition my hair with the Argon and Moroccan oils. It&#x27;s smells really great and for the price it&#x27;s a great steal.</li>
            <li> Use this for temporary effect. This is especially effective in humid environment where people don&#x27;t like oil on their hair, because this is really light. However, if you are expecting long term effect, like for day, it won&#x27;t help. It keeps your hair sleek and shiny may be for 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> Great product, I put it on before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moroccan oil since i got my hair done last year. The hairstylist told me that she was going to put moroccan oil in my hair,then she straightened my hair and i couldn&#x27;t believe it and my curly hair usually frizzes up in humid weather when straightened. I looked everywhere for the cheapest moroccan oil and every time i saw one it was like 30 dollars for 5 floz. I went to cvs and when i saw this i flipped out. It was $6.49 and they had it on sale for $2.99.I couldn&#x27;t resist getting it. This makes my hair really soft and manageable. It makes it easier to straighten my curly hair and keeps it straight when i go outside in high humidity. Im am so happy because now i can go to school with my hair straight without having to worry about it frizzing during the day and best of all, i can get my school pictures taken with straight hair. It will be my best picture yet.</li>
            <li> This works just as great as the original Moroccan Oil.  My hair is naturally straight, but I need help with fly aways.  Gives me the Jennifer Lopez/Sandra Bullock polished look :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and let me just say that it is worth the money! The price is good and it really just makes my hair smooth! I put a small amount on my damp hair and work it through the ends. NOT THE ROOTS! It leaves my hair soft and there is no frizz! Definitley repurchasing! Hope this was helpfull :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice!  It does make your hair feel softer and it&#x27;s easier to comb after you&#x27;ve applied it.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and this one works better than those.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this treatment as it actually has a decent amount of moisturizing oils in it compared to its drugstore brethren. A little goes a long way, and with just that small amount your hair feels more nourished, smoother and altogether more manageable. Sounds perfect right? I wish. This stuff reeks to high heaven with one of the most offensive scents I&#x27;ve ever found in a product. To me it smells like sickeningly sweet, chemically floral, expired perfume, and boy does it linger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I realized that I hated the smell I wanted to throw it out, but it seemed wasteful to just toss it because of its fragrance. So, in an attempt to make this stuff usable I allocated it to my shower to use in conjunction with my conditioner and wash it out minutes later. Unfortunately I was still catching whiffs of the oil hours after my shower. Seriously, the lasting power this stuff would be impressive if it wasn&#x27;t so darn gross. Admittedly I am much more sensitive to fragrance than most people I know, but even my boyfriend who has no problems whatsoever with fragrances thought that the smell of this was egregious. Sure it&#x27;s cheap and can make your hair look nice in the short term, but if you are in any way sensitive to fragrance or work in close proximity people who are, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Good oil to use on Brazillian HUman hair weave , also add the moroccan shampoo/conditioner , very good products for weave</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but turns out that I love this stuff! Been using it for about a month. I got my hair bleached (highlights and ends). I use this after washing to keep my hair from drying out and looking damaged. I use a flat iron most days.  While dry and damaged hair is inevitable with that combination, it def keeps my hair feeling soft and hydrated between washes. Best part is, you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the effect!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure, but I gave it a try. I have a ton of hair, but it is fine easily breakable hair that will frizz at any sign of rain. This product exceeded my expectations. It makes my hair super soft and easy to work with, and actually helps my styling to last longer. Ohh how it makes my natural hair color shine!! So glossy, and a little drop in your hands and worked through your damp hair after you shower will do wonders. Also if you blow dry, a smaller drop to kill off your fly aways. I would absolutely recommend this product. So what are you waiting for!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil really keeps my hair soft and manageable when I blow dry it . Love putting a few drops on my hair after flat ironing it and it would have a shine, would last a long time because it&#x27;s just a few drops so it&#x27;s a good buy. This product garnier is great.</li>
            <li> I use other Garnier Fructis products, especially the sleek and shine serum.  That is until I stopped the time-consuming ritual of blow-drying my hair every day.  I decided to start using leave in conditioners and letting my hair air dry instead.  I liked 10 in 1 but it was too expensive and I ran through a bottle every two weeks (long hair).  I tried Organix&#x27;s argan oil and loved it - and it also had a more reasonable price, lasting 3 1/2 weeks.  I was in an experimental mood so I decided to try this.  I smelled it at the store but I must have been having an odiferous hallucination because it smelled non-offensive at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it however was the last.  It smelled really cheap, really strong, and just yucky.  And worse, it worked on my hair minimally - neither making it sleek or shiny.  Suffice it to say, I went back to using Organix.</li>
            <li> Works great for frizzy dry hair</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon for my very stretchy hair. This oil makes my blond hair shiny, soft and flexible to handle! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Nice oil but not greasy. Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft. It is definitely a must for containing frizz.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old straightens her long wavy hair at night AND in the morning. She says this is the only Oil that keeps her hair healthy without causing MORE acne.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft. I also like it&#x27;s smell ..I have a very dry hair and this definitely helps a lot</li>
            <li> This product is a big help to my frizzy hair. I use it every time I blow dry my hair. It gives nice, healthy and shiny look.</li>
            <li> smells like Moroccan Oil! Makes my hair immediately soft. I apply this right after I wring out my wet hair. I don&#x27;t brush it. I then apply some Bumble &amp; Bumble stuff. and leave my hair to air dry. I get to wear my naturally wavy hair without it looking like I rolled out of bed. I believe after I added this serum, my curls actually dry beautiful waves - not frizz puffs! Another positive is that my hair is shiny, but that is because this is like an oil serum. I recommend this over the real moroccan oil, as i am sure it does the same thing. People can smell this on your hair I think and it is GOOD!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;m using it on the ends of my hair because I already spritz a light argan oil spray (One n&#x27; Only 12-in-1) into my wet hair (I don&#x27;t want to completely weigh down my hair). It leaves my ends looking very healthy. I&#x27;m going to work this into a routine where I add this to my shampoo to help with the dryness/frizz on the top of my head. It smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky or anything. I would definitely recommend this product for use on your dry ends to help reduce breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this product would come out in little drops because, the first time I used it, a huge glob came out onto my hand. You can&#x27;t just rinse your hands off after using it, though... You have to use hand sanitizer to get rid of it! Kind of annoying, but it&#x27;s such a great product that I&#x27;ll just live with it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other oil treatment for my hair, so I&#x27;m not an expert with hair oils.  Having said that, I used Suave brand Moroccan oil, and prior to using Garnier&#x27;s, I really liked it.  Then, once I did try Garnier&#x27;s, I immediately saw the difference.  It&#x27;s thicker and richer than Suave&#x27;s, and leaves my hair feeling far more soft and shiny.  Suave&#x27;s seems kind of watery now that I know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bit dry on the ends from dying and styling, and this oil makes a huge difference.  Not a miracle product, but it does leave my hair looking healthier.  I love the way it smells, too.  Very mild and non-offensive.  Just a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that lingers on. Great product!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY GARNIER SUPPORTS THE GENOCIDE OF GAZA. SUPPLYING SOAPS TO IDF TO WASH THE BLOOD OFF THEIR HANDS</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes hair sleek and silky with out weighing it down. I use such a small amount that the bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;This is THE MOST amazing hair treatment product I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I apply when it&#x27;s damp, and it leaves my hair super silky non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This little bottle was given to me by my aunt a few days ago. I thought hm, maybe she gave it to me &#x27;cause it sucks. But I tried it after my morning shower routine and it&#x27;s pretty damn good. If left to air dry, my hair becomes dry and frizzy, yech.&lt;br /&gt;With my previous hair product, I usually need to use a lot of product to keep my hair somewhat tame but it leaves my curls oily and if I wear my hair down, the oil gets on my face. So now I have oily hair and oily face. :-/&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It leaves my hair looking healthy. I think because my hair is so dry, it doesn&#x27;t get me that \\&quot;shine\\&quot; look, but it keeps this crazy hair TAME (sleek) which is more than I can say for all the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years. LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It leaves the hairs shiny and silky but i would take the Dimethicone (one of the ingredients) out of it. It would work better.</li>
            <li> Garnier&#x27;s Fructis Sleek and Shine Moroccan Oil Treatment is a product to add shine and control to unruly, dry, frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normal hair, not dry or greasy, but straight and very thick, very hard to control.  Often a conditioner is not enough and it goes every direction (especially in humidity).  Blow-drying and curling does not help much, and using mousse or gel makes it look like helmet head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is like a light massage oil in consistency, only slightly oily, mostly aqueous.  The fragrance is a light, flowery and spicy scent, and is subtle and not overwhelming.  In fact, fifteen minutes after using it, my family didn&#x27;t smell it around me, and I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be applied to dry or wet hair.  I usually comb it through wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am a believer.  It is natural and allows hair to fall in a sleek and natural way.  Not greasy and definitely not helmet head.  I like!</li>
            <li> I used this....then got back in the shower immediately to try and get this stinky, overpowering old lady perfume out of my hair. Its going back. Its awful. I don&#x27;t mind some fragrance, but this stinks. Its very very strong. I like garnier products generally, and have used leave in conditioners from them before - but none of them smelled like this. I don&#x27;t even mind strong medicinal smells, like tea tree oil. This just smells like you put a whole bottle of cheap perfume on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it smooths hair ? - I can&#x27;t stand it long enough to find out. It made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT SOOO MUCH. It makes my hair soft and when i use it before i sleep, it feels good ,and it also smells good</li>
            <li> thick oil but not sticky it helps keep your hair soft and resilient after combing/styling</li>
            <li> It works, but it isn&#x27;t a replacement for moroccan oil as others have stated. It&#x27;s cheaper though, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised in a magazine, and it sounded too good to be true... argan oil (which I ADORE and is a life saver for hair) that wouldn&#x27;t make your tresses slick and greasy?! Count me in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply it while your hair is wet, damp, or totally dry - so it can be used really at any time. Guess I&#x27;ll explain my &#x27;hair situation&#x27;... I have waist-length, naturally spirally curly, THICK, unruly, misbehaving, course hair!!! (I grow it out and donate it to wig companies, so I like to use good stuff on it). Anyhoo, lately, despite never using any heat or chemicals on my hair and always going au naturale, the ends were feeling dried out and not soft at all. I do not like to use leave-in conditioners or styling products; they seem to attract dirt or dust or something and make my hair not shine with all it&#x27;s glory, and it seems to weigh down my natural curls. Hair this long usually the curls just straighten out due to the sheer weight; but not mine, it&#x27;s curly right down to my waist. However; it felt like bleck, and was starting to look frizzy, which is a nightmare...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product first on my totally dry hair (I only wash it twice a week). I was instantly AMAZED not only at the incredibly spicy aroma of the product, but the texture, and what it did for my ENDS! The curls popped back out, the frizz went away, and my hair truly shined so bright, I felt like I had the sun on my head! Again, I am amazed by this stuff - and all ya need, even for super crazy long hair like mine, is a size of a DIME squirted into your palm - rub it around your hands, and apply to every strand (I avoid the scalp area cuz that just is never, ever dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it also after my twice-a-week washing - on super WET hair, just outta the shower. Just rubbed in that dime-sized amount. And whoa. Again, controlled curls, VERY soft ends, soft hair all over, glorified SHINE, and ooooohhh mmmyyyy the aroma!!! I hate perfume, it makes me gag, so this wonderfullynatural smelling hair stuff is all I need or want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is truly liquid gold for your hair. If you&#x27;ve got the course, crazy frizzy stuff, or just need to bring some shiny life back into your hair... try it. It&#x27;s so affordable too, I&#x27;m going back to the store to clean them out so I don&#x27;t ever run out! &#x3D;-D</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff! I was talking to someone in Walmart when this product caught my eye. I have never been a fan of Garnier products as I found they left my hair feeling heavy and oily. Their new line of products has really stepped up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick but fine hair that gets oily very easily. I have to wash it ever day, without fail. I got it cut yesterday and my stylist commented that I have the finest hair she&#x27;s ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually put quite a bit of this product on my hair and it looks awesome! Not heavy, not greasy, not oily! I love it. I put it on wet, then put more on dry right before using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried this not expecting it to work but it is great.  I have very long hair and it does not look greasy when I use the product.  It tames dry or flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER dealt with STATIC cling in my life as I am right now.  I started using Garnier&#x27;s Moroccan Oil in my hair a few weeks ago and noticed every time I blow dryed my hair straight I had TONS of static. My hair literally stood up straight it was so charged.  When I was able to tame the static it left my hair oily and the blow dry didn&#x27;t last more than a day. Even when I wear my hair curly I find my clothes sticking to me and I constantly shock my son and fiance.  This only happened after I started using this product.  Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be using it anymore because of this.</li>
            <li> Good product, very nice smell and texture.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal fr what its worth. I have tried Argan oil and prefer this any day. I love that the oil brings in shine and de-tangles hair. Don&#x27;t use a lot though. All you need is a little bit. I put it a few drops at a time. Rub the drops on to the palm of my hand and run my palms into my hair. The price on Amazon isn&#x27;t necessarily the best one, but for the convenience that it offers, this one is a winner in my books.</li>
            <li> Kept my hair silky and shiny. Super good investment !</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on here, I figured I would be cheap and headed on over to our local CVS and bought this crap in a jar. I applied it both while conditioning my hair in the shower and afterwards. This did NOTHING to control frizz, make it soft or make my wild curly hair, that I always straighten, actually look GOOD curly. I put it up in a ponytail, like always, before leaving the house. By the end of the day, my hair was even worst looking then if I applied no product at all. Perhaps if you have naturally straight hair or don&#x27;t have humid, sticky summers like where I live.</li>
