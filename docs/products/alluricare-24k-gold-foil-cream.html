            <li>It is a huge factor for me to hold on to the product or ditch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, citrus smell it has too.  </li>
            <li>Using this cream at night has made my skin smooth and moisturized.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I received a free or discounted product to facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.und 3 months of continued use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use this product overnight, I enjoy its smooth feeling against my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 24k moisturizer goes on smooth, is lightweight and keeps your face hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>premature aging of the skin by fighting off free radicals</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use the term &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;, rather the skin has lifted and filled out.  </li>
            <li>is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given a product at a free or reduced price.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good though.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it, which is good since I have highly sensitive</li>
            <li>but I heard such great things about it from friends that I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would be a product I would love when I first saw it</li>
            <li>It is light, clear, has a fresh citrusy smell and feels good when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on a bit sticky but gets absorbed very quickly and just leaves my skin</li>
            <li>I loved the light feeling of the gel, but on humid days, it left my face feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>The clean, stimulated feeling?  </li>
            <li>Contains the same Vitamin C as any serum but more effective in reducing the appearance of age around your eyes, and on your chest and neck and decollete.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice frosted glass jar with a pretty golden lid and golden  print.</li>
            <li>These ingredients are huge antioxidants and are contributing to a smoother skin, thus, providing a powerful anti-wrinkle activity inside the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*GENTLE &amp; EFFECTIVE for every skin type, even those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels cool and soothing when applied to the skin and is</li>
            <li>The directions say to spread it on the face and lightly massage it in until absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However as I have gotten older ignoring my skin is just not an option any more.</li>
            <li>I was going to go through the jar quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the upper end of the 40&#x27;s and even though I have great skin (thanks to genetics)</li>
            <li>I have seen a result quickly and dramatically as I have noticed lines disappearing and my eyes lifting</li>
            <li>I most likely will buy more as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was searching  for good moisturizing cream for long time .I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this product so far.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold also has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li>The result is a powerful and synergistic combination of anti-oxidants and collagen boosters to provide maximum anti-wrinkle, anti-aging and skin brightening activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is a powerful and synergistic combination of anti-oxidants and collagen boosters to provide maximum anti-wrinkle, anti-aging and skin brightening activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell, but not too powerful.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>After a week of using this, I noticed that my skin is feeling so smooth, and those fine lines are tightening up, especially around my eyes!</li>
            <li>THAT HELPS KEEP YOU YOUNG - Fill-in and diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It really does though!</li>
            <li>and when I first went to use it, my thought was</li>
            <li>first I was concerned that the gold flakes would result in stripper glitter all over.</li>
            <li>The cream is pretty too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does make my facial skin feel better and look healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this product consistently to report my long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that 24K Gold Foil Cream has the above ingredients inside!</li>
            <li>had so many facial benefits until I read up on it.  </li>
            <li>ALLURICARE has made a night moisturizing anti-aging cream in a first class fashion.</li>
            <li>It seems to have given my facial skin more elasticity and boyancy.  </li>
            <li>I have a more even skin tone, it definitely is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t mentioned to her that I had tried a new product, but the first thing she said to me when she saw me was that my skin was glowing!</li>
            <li>I can tell in the last week that my skin is far more vibrant and I feel comfortable not wearing make-up so much because my skin has cleared up and is glowing so much.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was surprised at the packaging, it&#x27;s just darned pretty to look at!</li>
            <li>My skin is Super Sensitive</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my face down, which makes me very happy.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency with little to no scent.</li>
            <li>you can see in my pictures, after using the product for 10 days, much of my blotchyness is gone.  </li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth and I definitely recommend the texture of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, this spreads very well and so one doesn&#x27;t use up the product so quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So what does this product really do, you ask?</li>
            <li>Below I have listed the same information that is available on the product&#x27;s Amazon page</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky when it comes for choosing a skin care product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#2 Real 24K Gold Inside your Cream Jar</li>
            <li>My face is now so much smoother and tighter then before.</li>
            <li>Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.</li>
            <li>Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.</li>
            <li>A lot of times you get these creams and they smell so much like chemicals you don&#x27;t dare put them on your face.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much I can say about this face cream/gel except that it moisturizes quite well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well</li>
            <li>It does not take much of this beauty gel.  </li>
            <li>This cream contains real 24k gold flecks that are said to help make your skin even healthier.  </li>
            <li>I did however feel like my face was much softer after using the cream.  </li>
            <li>I see any real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Only the finest natural and organic healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot yet, other than my skin being more moisturized</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a real detailed review.</li>
            <li>I like that it is very gentle for skin, even sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>My skin actually felt as soft as rose petals, even the next</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by</li>
            <li>ALLURICARE Face Mask is a true anti-aging cream that is not sold in salons and comes with a 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also read that gold is thought to have antibacterial properties, and no one wants bacteria to live all over their face,</li>
            <li>I had tried many different facial moisturizes</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any major improvements in the condition of my fine lines, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t do a thorough exam of them before using the product because I don&#x27;t have very deep lines and the ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen multiple reports on the long lasting rewards of similar products, so I do have great hopes for my continued use of the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I simply rub it into my face until the gel is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer / mask - it has a lovely subtle smell of citrus.</li>
            <li>but I like new things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am excited that my skin is not dry after using this following my astringent.  </li>
            <li>you enjoy and have in your daily regiment facial mask routine</li>
            <li>It takes very little of this gel to apply to the face and neck and the minute the gel goes on the sense of refreshing is felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can actually feel it working the first time you apply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light scent - not over-powering where it will interfere with other scents you may be wearing and the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a slightly sticky residue when I first applied the cream, but it seemed to go away after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice a slightly sticky residue when I first applied the cream, but it seemed to go away after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference is the combination of these and when used after a careful exfoliation it is applied at night and works during nocturnal hours to erase fine lines and smooth the skin and plump the skin so that even when waking up to that usual sagging appearance and pillow-creased face you notice a major difference in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>Other than that, I think its&#x27; a 5 star worthy.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended (especially for around the eyes, the procerus, the marionette lines and the saggy neck look.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure that would work for me and extreme dry skin I have.</li>
            <li>I tend to use organic brands of facial lotion and while they help, I had no idea how much they were failing me till I tried Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Alluricare has actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*HEALTHY GOLD FACIAL MASK FOR SKIN CARE - Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was completely sold on this product after being complimented by my sister who is a Master Esthetician.</li>
            <li>I have don&#x27;t bother me much as far as my appearance goes.</li>
            <li>This unique product is not available in any spa or salon.</li>
            <li>This unique product is not available in any spa or salon.</li>
            <li>live in a very humid climate, and very often have trouble with gel-type creams.  </li>
            <li>only reason I gave this facial mask 4 stars is because it did irritate my skin the first time I used</li>
            <li>And, really, that is all I need, because it spreads on thinly and easily.  </li>
            <li>This jar will last awhile since all you need is a little dab for it to smooth out over your face and</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t really expect to in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a total luxury product - but is very affordable...and saves me from hitting the local spa!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But, like everyone, I am not getting any younger and I want my skin to look 20 years younger than I really am.  </li>
            <li>cream was easy to apply - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Gold actually has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Contains essential oils to help you keep looking young.</li>
            <li>A dime sized amount of the gel was enough to completely hydrate my face and neck.</li>
            <li>company offers a 100% money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>When I ordered the product I was kind of skeptical...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle enough not to be overwhelming, but enough to delight you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, no dry patches and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, no dry patches and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered quickly that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This mask is so pretty with the little flecks of gold suspended in the gel.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup, so it felt like it was a bit useless to me if I was wiping it right off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and apply it to my entire face and neck and have barely made an indent in the contents.  </li>
            <li>It can be used on any skin type from sensitive to dry to combination.</li>
            <li>You really feel pampered when you apply this and see the little chips of gold foil on your face.</li>

            <li> : I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, citrus smell it has too.  </li>
            <li> Using this cream at night has made my skin smooth and moisturized.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I received a free or discounted product to facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.und 3 months of continued use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use this product overnight, I enjoy its smooth feeling against my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 24k moisturizer goes on smooth, is lightweight and keeps your face hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> premature aging of the skin by fighting off free radicals</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use the term &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;, rather the skin has lifted and filled out.  </li>
            <li> is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given a product at a free or reduced price.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it, which is good since I have highly sensitive</li>
            <li> but I heard such great things about it from friends that I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would be a product I would love when I first saw it</li>
            <li> It is light, clear, has a fresh citrusy smell and feels good when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a bit sticky but gets absorbed very quickly and just leaves my skin</li>
            <li> I loved the light feeling of the gel, but on humid days, it left my face feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li> The clean, stimulated feeling?  </li>
            <li> Contains the same Vitamin C as any serum but more effective in reducing the appearance of age around your eyes, and on your chest and neck and decollete.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice frosted glass jar with a pretty golden lid and golden  print.</li>
            <li> These ingredients are huge antioxidants and are contributing to a smoother skin, thus, providing a powerful anti-wrinkle activity inside the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*GENTLE &amp; EFFECTIVE for every skin type, even those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels cool and soothing when applied to the skin and is</li>
            <li> The directions say to spread it on the face and lightly massage it in until absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However as I have gotten older ignoring my skin is just not an option any more.</li>
            <li> I was going to go through the jar quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the upper end of the 40&#x27;s and even though I have great skin (thanks to genetics)</li>
            <li> I have seen a result quickly and dramatically as I have noticed lines disappearing and my eyes lifting</li>
            <li> I most likely will buy more as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was searching  for good moisturizing cream for long time .I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this product so far.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold also has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> The result is a powerful and synergistic combination of anti-oxidants and collagen boosters to provide maximum anti-wrinkle, anti-aging and skin brightening activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is a powerful and synergistic combination of anti-oxidants and collagen boosters to provide maximum anti-wrinkle, anti-aging and skin brightening activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell, but not too powerful.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> After a week of using this, I noticed that my skin is feeling so smooth, and those fine lines are tightening up, especially around my eyes!</li>
            <li> THAT HELPS KEEP YOU YOUNG - Fill-in and diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It really does though!</li>
            <li> and when I first went to use it, my thought was</li>
            <li> first I was concerned that the gold flakes would result in stripper glitter all over.</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does make my facial skin feel better and look healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this product consistently to report my long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that 24K Gold Foil Cream has the above ingredients inside!</li>
            <li> had so many facial benefits until I read up on it.  </li>
            <li> ALLURICARE has made a night moisturizing anti-aging cream in a first class fashion.</li>
            <li> It seems to have given my facial skin more elasticity and boyancy.  </li>
            <li> I have a more even skin tone, it definitely is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t mentioned to her that I had tried a new product, but the first thing she said to me when she saw me was that my skin was glowing!</li>
            <li> I can tell in the last week that my skin is far more vibrant and I feel comfortable not wearing make-up so much because my skin has cleared up and is glowing so much.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was surprised at the packaging, it&#x27;s just darned pretty to look at!</li>
            <li> My skin is Super Sensitive</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my face down, which makes me very happy.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency with little to no scent.</li>
            <li> you can see in my pictures, after using the product for 10 days, much of my blotchyness is gone.  </li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth and I definitely recommend the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly, this spreads very well and so one doesn&#x27;t use up the product so quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So what does this product really do, you ask?</li>
            <li> Below I have listed the same information that is available on the product&#x27;s Amazon page</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very picky when it comes for choosing a skin care product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#2 Real 24K Gold Inside your Cream Jar</li>
            <li> My face is now so much smoother and tighter then before.</li>
            <li> Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.</li>
            <li> Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.</li>
            <li> A lot of times you get these creams and they smell so much like chemicals you don&#x27;t dare put them on your face.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much I can say about this face cream/gel except that it moisturizes quite well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well</li>
            <li> It does not take much of this beauty gel.  </li>
            <li> This cream contains real 24k gold flecks that are said to help make your skin even healthier.  </li>
            <li> I did however feel like my face was much softer after using the cream.  </li>
            <li> I see any real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Only the finest natural and organic healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot yet, other than my skin being more moisturized</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a real detailed review.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very gentle for skin, even sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> My skin actually felt as soft as rose petals, even the next</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by</li>
            <li> ALLURICARE Face Mask is a true anti-aging cream that is not sold in salons and comes with a 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also read that gold is thought to have antibacterial properties, and no one wants bacteria to live all over their face,</li>
            <li> I had tried many different facial moisturizes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any major improvements in the condition of my fine lines, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t do a thorough exam of them before using the product because I don&#x27;t have very deep lines and the ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen multiple reports on the long lasting rewards of similar products, so I do have great hopes for my continued use of the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I simply rub it into my face until the gel is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer / mask - it has a lovely subtle smell of citrus.</li>
            <li> but I like new things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am excited that my skin is not dry after using this following my astringent.  </li>
            <li> you enjoy and have in your daily regiment facial mask routine</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this gel to apply to the face and neck and the minute the gel goes on the sense of refreshing is felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can actually feel it working the first time you apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light scent - not over-powering where it will interfere with other scents you may be wearing and the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a slightly sticky residue when I first applied the cream, but it seemed to go away after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice a slightly sticky residue when I first applied the cream, but it seemed to go away after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference is the combination of these and when used after a careful exfoliation it is applied at night and works during nocturnal hours to erase fine lines and smooth the skin and plump the skin so that even when waking up to that usual sagging appearance and pillow-creased face you notice a major difference in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> Other than that, I think its&#x27; a 5 star worthy.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended (especially for around the eyes, the procerus, the marionette lines and the saggy neck look.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure that would work for me and extreme dry skin I have.</li>
            <li> I tend to use organic brands of facial lotion and while they help, I had no idea how much they were failing me till I tried Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Alluricare has actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*HEALTHY GOLD FACIAL MASK FOR SKIN CARE - Improve skin texture and brightness with intense moisture and balance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was completely sold on this product after being complimented by my sister who is a Master Esthetician.</li>
            <li> I have don&#x27;t bother me much as far as my appearance goes.</li>
            <li> This unique product is not available in any spa or salon.</li>
            <li> This unique product is not available in any spa or salon.</li>
            <li> live in a very humid climate, and very often have trouble with gel-type creams.  </li>
            <li> only reason I gave this facial mask 4 stars is because it did irritate my skin the first time I used</li>
            <li> And, really, that is all I need, because it spreads on thinly and easily.  </li>
            <li> This jar will last awhile since all you need is a little dab for it to smooth out over your face and</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t really expect to in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a total luxury product - but is very affordable...and saves me from hitting the local spa!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, like everyone, I am not getting any younger and I want my skin to look 20 years younger than I really am.  </li>
            <li> cream was easy to apply - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Gold actually has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Contains essential oils to help you keep looking young.</li>
            <li> A dime sized amount of the gel was enough to completely hydrate my face and neck.</li>
            <li> company offers a 100% money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the product I was kind of skeptical...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough not to be overwhelming, but enough to delight you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, no dry patches and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, no dry patches and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered quickly that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This mask is so pretty with the little flecks of gold suspended in the gel.  </li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup, so it felt like it was a bit useless to me if I was wiping it right off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and apply it to my entire face and neck and have barely made an indent in the contents.  </li>
            <li> It can be used on any skin type from sensitive to dry to combination.</li>
            <li> You really feel pampered when you apply this and see the little chips of gold foil on your face.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off at the yellow coloring of the cream because I am so used to white or clear serums</li>
            <li> If I use too much, my skin is not able to absorb it all.  </li>
            <li> I never really used much make up and never had skin issues, that is until the last few years.</li>
            <li> This jar will last a long time!  </li>
            <li> and I was starting to experience dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Things that should help it, only seem to make it break out or get extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Also, you do not use it every single night or multiple times a day to see improvement.  </li>
            <li> The drying process doesn&#x27;t take too long - a couple of minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> I was curious as to having actual flecks of gold stuck to my skin when using it</li>
            <li> I normally expect everything to do the complete opposite of what it claims it will do, because as I mentioned above, my skin is weird.</li>
            <li> I normally expect everything to do the complete opposite of what it claims it will do, because as I mentioned above, my skin is weird.</li>
            <li> You absolutely do not need a lot product to cover your face, so this size will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Gold Foil Cream from Alluricare does NOT sit on the surface of my skin; it does NOT stay tacky way too long, and it does NOT feel like a film drying on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I noticed that the cream is a clear gel, very odd for a moisturizer / mask.</li>
            <li> I can promise you none of the other stuff that I have tried even came close and not one of them had a money back guarantee on them.</li>

            <li> My skin is so incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> As I am aging, my skin is getting very dry and is lacking the elasticity it once had.  </li>
            <li> After my second pregnancy wreaked havoc on my face, I decided I needed to start looking into creams to give my skin a little boost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It means I have been trying a few different things to delay that aging process a bit and keep my skin youthful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> definitely will be using this a few times a week until it is gone.  </li>
            <li> The price is right (not to expensive).</li>

            <li> I was skeptical because the box is so pretty.</li>
            <li> First off, I must say that I have weird skin.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The gel should be applied to the face in a thin layer and left on overnight, several times a week.  </li>
            <li> A small dollop will go a long way.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish I had tried this as a facial mask before! It feels like results I would get at fancy salons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would be a product I would love when I first saw it but I heard such great things about it from friends that I was excited to try it. I am not a girly girl. I am book worm, a geek! I rather buy books than make up. However as I have gotten older ignoring my skin is just not an option any more. I never really used much make up and never had skin issues, that is until the last few years. My skin is so incredibly dry. I tend to use organic brands of facial lotion and while they help, I had no idea how much they were failing me till I tried Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The jar says to use a few times a week and I wasn&#x27;t sure that would work for me and extreme dry skin I have. It really does though! For days after using the cream my skin is so soft and looks wonderful. It goes on a bit sticky but gets absorbed very quickly and just leaves my skin silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Disclaimer: I was given this product without charge in order to review it!</li>
            <li> An elegant beauty cream with flecks of gold throughout the gel.  Yes, I&#x27;d consider this more of a gel than an cream and when I first went to use it, my thought was I was going to go through the jar quickly.  That said, a little of this goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and apply it to my entire face and neck and have barely made an indent in the contents.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin but I wouldn&#x27;t really expect to in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my skin is left feeling a bit sticky until the products fully absorbs and dries. The drying process doesn&#x27;t take too long - a couple of minutes or so.  I love the scent of the product. It&#x27;s a very light scent - not over-powering where it will interfere with other scents you may be wearing and the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around for a long time.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who worry about the gold in it being a metal - you need not worry about that.  Gold doesn&#x27;t react with our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a huge discount.  That said, my opinions are solely my own with the intentions of sharing with you how the product worked for me.</li>
            <li> The Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream is a refreshing feeling, lightweight gel for your face.  I loved the light feeling of the gel, but on humid days, it left my face feeling sticky.  When I used the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream at night, I never noticed any stickiness, no matter how humid it was.  The citrus scent is soothing and calming to the senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream for a couple of weeks.  While I can&#x27;t brag on any of the marvelous claims about tightening and lifting, I do feel like it would work as claimed over more time.  I&#x27;ve seen multiple reports on the long lasting rewards of similar products, so I do have great hopes for my continued use of the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can happily report that I experienced no adverse reactions to the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the upper end of the 40&#x27;s and even though I have great skin (thanks to genetics) I&#x27;m starting to show my age. (sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It means I have been trying a few different things to delay that aging process a bit and keep my skin youthful.&lt;br /&gt;This Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream was a surprise in the fact that it worked! First of all, I was surprised at the packaging, it&#x27;s just darned pretty to look at! I was curious as to having actual flecks of gold stuck to my skin when using it (I didn&#x27;t) and was delighted that it wasn&#x27;t sticky or greasy! My skin actually felt as soft as rose petals, even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a total luxury product - but is very affordable...and saves me from hitting the local spa!&lt;br /&gt;I did get it at a reduced cost for the purposes of the review, but all thoughts are entirely my own -- I am planning to keep this in my beauty regime even after my jar is gone. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> As I am aging, my skin is getting very dry and is lacking the elasticity it once had.  I find that often it is red and blotchy.  I am a perpetual beauty product seeker.  I try many products searching for something to do change my skin.  I have been using the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream for 10 days now.  I already see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that will last for awhile.  A small dollop will go a long way.  Also, you do not use it every single night or multiple times a day to see improvement.  Alluricare recommends using it a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another gold foil cream about a year ago and I couldn&#x27;t get over how complicated it was to use.  This is a simple serum that you can apply to your face and neck.  I even rub it on the top of my hands.  I like that it is very gentle for skin, even sensitive skin like mine.  Sometimes you think that a product needs to burn to work, that is simply not the case.  If it is burning, your skin is not reacting well to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in my pictures, after using the product for 10 days, much of my blotchyness is gone.  It has smoothed out my skin tone.  I feel like my face has been much more radiant and brighter since using the Gold Foil Cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alluricare&#x27;s 24K Gold Foil Cream is very refreshing on the skin.  You know that feeling after you wash your face?  The clean, stimulated feeling?  That is what using the Gold Foil Cream is like when you apply it to your face.  I love the fresh, citrus smell it has too.  It&#x27;s subtle enough not to be overwhelming, but enough to delight you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for the purpose of this review.  All opinions are my own and were not influenced in anyway.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and I was starting to experience dry skin.  I tried the under eye patches and I liked the collagen type serum in the patches, so I wanted something similiar to put on my skin.  I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  Using this cream at night has made my skin smooth and moisturized.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to see what the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; moisturizer rush was all about. I choose this one at a promotional price and am really happy with my purchase! It has a nice consistency with little to no scent. I was a little put off at the yellow coloring of the cream because I am so used to white or clear serums but I like new things. I have combination skin with high sensitivity and this did not leave it broken out or cause any irritations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now and I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  My face is smooth and I definitely recommend the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.  I finished it... ....nothing happened. I would not buy  again.</li>
            <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t done anything good for my skin.Since I start using it I start to have red spots.DON&#x27;T BUY THIS IF YOU LOVE YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer / mask - it has a lovely subtle smell of citrus. Then I noticed that the cream is a clear gel, very odd for a moisturizer / mask. And then I noticed the little gold flakes. What a remarkable cool product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and smell is wonderful, but does it work? Well yes it does in a gentle wonderful way. The product goes on beautifully - avoiding area around the eyes. It dries within a few minutes. Leaving it on overnight works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was concerned that the gold flakes would result in stripper glitter all over. The flakes are small enough and few enough that there is no stripper effect, that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a week, skin already feels better, and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> Not a cream it&#x27;s a gel that didn&#x27;t work on my neck.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the box is so pretty. The cream is pretty too. Has a wonderful scent, kind of citrus but not certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make my facial skin feel better and look healthier. It has a lot of great ingredients, including retinol and jojoba oil, and a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, this spreads very well and so one doesn&#x27;t use up the product so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for sincere review.</li>
            <li> i have not seen any difference ! i have been using it 2 time a week .</li>
            <li> Alluricare has actually surprised me.  I have seen a result quickly and dramatically as I have noticed lines disappearing and my eyes lifting and I am feeling younger and much more beautiful.  When I ordered the product I was kind of skeptical... but I am a BELIEVER now!!  The price was comparable and the value is amazing.  This product is a rock star winner with me!!  I will be keeping this in my skin care line above all others !!</li>
            <li> Excellent  cream love it .I was searching  for good moisturizing cream for long time .I put it on at night and in the morning  my face feels  lifted and moisturized. I will definitely  continue  buying  and I recommended  to my friends  .</li>
            <li> still trying it.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> First off, I must say that I have weird skin. Things that should help it, only seem to make it break out or get extremely dry. I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream. My skin soaks it up like a glass of water spilled in the Sahara desert. So what does this product really do, you ask?

            <li> [[VIDEOID:fa6aaac06dae373628a86790f89fbaee]] Facial Mask for Your Beauty Treatments to Make Your Skin Smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy and have in your daily regiment facial mask routine, this Gold Foil Cream could become your one of your favorites. Here&#x27;s why I got this beauty product to test on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 My skin is Super Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky when it comes for choosing a skin care product. It is even more important when I am looking for cleansing and mask-type of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this gold foil cream, I tried it out for a week with my 3 applications. I did not get any of red irritation areas I would get from harsher products. It is a huge factor for me to hold on to the product or ditch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Real 24K Gold Inside your Cream Jar&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done my research on the use of gold in skin care products. And it goes centuries ago when gold dust was used topically as well as internally. It has been used for both beauty and medicinal purposes. Gold dust is used in creams and lotions to refine and rejuvenate skin. I&#x27;ll be using this product consistently to report my long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use this product overnight, I enjoy its smooth feeling against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Essential Oils and Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;I love that 24K Gold Foil Cream has the above ingredients inside! These ingredients are huge antioxidants and are contributing to a smoother skin, thus, providing a powerful anti-wrinkle activity inside the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this product so far. It has been provided to me for thorough testing and review by the company. My opinions are mine and come from my personal use of this product in my home.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the jar in the mail it felt like I hit a gold mine. The jar makes it look really expensive. I had tried many different facial moisturizes but nothing comes as close as the Alluicare 24k gold foil cream gel moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning after cleansing my face and after a day or so I could feel a difference in my face. My face is now so much smoother and tighter then before. Also I noticed I have less acne and scars from before are going away. My face feels so much more refreshed after I apply it and gives me an energized feeling. It even gives my face a even skin tone. I also use a dab on my hands and feet to maintain hydration and smoothnesses. It is good for the feet, if your always standing and in pain. My feet feel rejuvenated afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 24k moisturizer goes on smooth, is lightweight and keeps your face hydrated all day. The best part is im able to apply makeup ontop. It can be used on any skin type from sensitive to dry to combination. This jar will last awhile since all you need is a little dab for it to smooth out over your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know gold had so many facial benefits until I read up on it.  Some benifits are:&lt;br /&gt;-Improves/stimulates circulation&lt;br /&gt;-Increases radiance and stimulates skin cells&lt;br /&gt;-Slows collagen depletion&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, sun damage and age spots&lt;br /&gt;-Prevents premature aging of the skin by fighting off free radicals&lt;br /&gt;-Gold also has the ability to lighten the complexion&lt;br /&gt;-Increases elasticity of the skin&lt;br /&gt;-Gold can help ease joint and body aches and pains&lt;br /&gt;-Fights acne and aids in treatment of scarring by speeding up the healing process&lt;br /&gt;-Smooths out wrinkles &amp; firms the skin&lt;br /&gt;-Soothes inflammation&lt;br /&gt;-Treats skin discoloration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold also has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

            <li> I have never been one to use creams or special lotions on my face, but when I turned 30 I started noticing those little lines we all hate to see! After my second pregnancy wreaked havoc on my face, I decided I needed to start looking into creams to give my skin a little boost. This Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream has done the trick! When I first opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s smell. A lot of times you get these creams and they smell so much like chemicals you don&#x27;t dare put them on your face. However, this cream has a refreshing, light citrusy scent. I discovered quickly that a little bit goes a long way. A dime sized amount of the gel was enough to completely hydrate my face and neck. This jar will last a long time!  The little flecks of gold make my face look radiant, even without makeup. After a week of using this, I noticed that my skin is feeling so smooth, and those fine lines are tightening up, especially around my eyes! I was completely sold on this product after being complimented by my sister who is a Master Esthetician. I hadn&#x27;t mentioned to her that I had tried a new product, but the first thing she said to me when she saw me was that my skin was glowing! I&#x27;m excited to see what improvement continued use brings to my skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Alluricare 24K Gold Foil Cream. The smell of it is amazing and has a citrus smell to it. I was glad to know that it was a gel and goes on my face so smoothly. I have been using it 2 times a day (morning &amp; night). My face feels so refreshed and I can feel my skin tightening in a good way. I can tell in the last week that my skin is far more vibrant and I feel comfortable not wearing make-up so much because my skin has cleared up and is glowing so much. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and keeping it in my daily regimen. I wish that the product had more details on how to use the product in the box. Other than that, I think its&#x27; a 5 star worthy.</li>
            <li> Yes, I admit, I loved the Gold flakes in this cream, that is one reason I wanted to try it.  But, like everyone, I am not getting any younger and I want my skin to look 20 years younger than I really am.  The Alluricare cream is different from a regular creamy, white moisturizer.  It is light, clear, has a fresh citrusy smell and feels good when you apply it.  It is not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t make my face or neck feel sticky or tight when it dries.  It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this facial mask 4 stars is because it did irritate my skin the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a small acne breakout the first time I used it.  But I have been using it 3 times a week every since and my skin looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many benefits of gold for your skin and body. Gold is a metal but doesn&#x27;t react with our bodies- so no need to even think about that when you are deciding whether or not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will be using this a few times a week until it is gone.  I most likely will buy more as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free or discounted product to facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much I can say about this face cream/gel except that it moisturizes quite well.  I have been using it (at night only after removing makeup) and my skin feels great and not dry at all.  My usual nighttime routine consists of cleasning, using an astringent, a toner, as well as a moisturizer and lately I&#x27;ve been using a spot treatment.  I have used this cream as a nighttime mask in the place of my usual moisturizer and it does it&#x27;s job very well and it has a very pleasant, yet light scent.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my face down, which makes me very happy.  You absolutely do not need a lot product to cover your face, so this size will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited that my skin is not dry after using this following my astringent.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any major improvements in the condition of my fine lines, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t do a thorough exam of them before using the product because I don&#x27;t have very deep lines and the ones I have don&#x27;t bother me much as far as my appearance goes. I&#x27;m sure with prolonged use I will see a difference simply because of all of the benefits of using some of the ingredients in this salon quality facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the benefits of using gold on the skin are:&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;br /&gt;Reduced Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Locks in Moisture&lt;br /&gt;Keeps Skin Firm by Maintaining Collagen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few.  I also read that gold is thought to have antibacterial properties, and no one wants bacteria to live all over their face, right?  I know I don&#x27;t.  Anyway, the bottom line is, I would recommend this product to those who are looking for rejuvenation and moisture after cleasning, definitely.</li>
            <li> I love the cream.  Makes my face shine.  I like what it does for my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a real detailed review. So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> This mask is so pretty with the little flecks of gold suspended in the gel.  It feels cool and soothing when applied to the skin and is non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula has several botanical ingredients and oils to lock in moisture, as well amino acids and vitamins A and E that are intended to support skin structure and improve the appearance of skin damaged by sun and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel should be applied to the face in a thin layer and left on overnight, several times a week.  It is pleasant to use after a warm bath, especially if it has been refrigerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heavy glass jar contains 1.6 oz. (50 g) of facial treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Deionized water, Matrixyl 3000, arginine, yeast extract, Vaccinium angustifolium fruit extract, beta-glucan, Aloe vera, trehalose, sodium PCA, collagen, jojoba oil, macadamia nut oil, 24k bio-gold, sodium hyaluronate, evening primrose oil, glycerin, polysorbate 20, retinol, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alluricare provided a jar for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> ALLURICARE has made a night moisturizing anti-aging cream in a first class fashion. The 24K gold is not an advertising ploy- gold is a true antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent! This product is meant for night time use several times per week. It takes very little of this gel to apply to the face and neck and the minute the gel goes on the sense of refreshing is felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the gold this gel contains deionized water, Matrixyl 3000, Arginine, yeast extract, vaccinium angustifolium fruit extract,Aloe Vera, Trehalose, sodium PCA, amino acids, Jojoba oil, Macadamia nut oil, Sodium Hyaluranate (hyaluronic acid), Evening Primrose Oil, glycerin, polysorbate 20, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate - all the anti-aging products other creams have in varying amounts. The difference is the combination of these and when used after a careful exfoliation it is applied at night and works during nocturnal hours to erase fine lines and smooth the skin and plump the skin so that even when waking up to that usual sagging appearance and pillow-creased face you notice a major difference in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the ingredients, then top that off with 24K gold and voila! What a difference! Very highly recommended (especially for around the eyes, the procerus, the marionette lines and the saggy neck look. Grady Harp, March 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is probably the prettiest moisturizer and anti-aging cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes in a nice frosted glass jar with a pretty golden lid and golden  print. In addition to being pretty, it is also packed with plenty of ingredients that are good for you. I have been putting this only on one side of my face so that I can tell if there is a difference. There is definitely a difference in the way my skin feels on the side I applied it to verses the one without. My skin feels smoother, softer and firmer on the applied side. You can actually feel it working the first time you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love gold? You really feel pampered when you apply this and see the little chips of gold foil on your face. You apply this at night and let it do its job while you sleep. And the gold isn&#x27;t just for looks either. Gold actually has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the gold, the ingredients are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized Water, Matrixyl 3000, Arginine, Yeast Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Aloe Vera, Trehalose, Sodium PCA, Collagen, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, 24k Bio-Gold, Sodium Hyaluronate, Evening Primrose Oil, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company offers a 100% money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product. You can&#x27;t beat that. I would recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel as an overnight sleep mask.  I am very impressed with the results!  It seems to have given my facial skin more elasticity and boyancy.  I don&#x27;t like to use the term &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;, rather the skin has lifted and filled out.  I have a more even skin tone, it definitely is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not caused any blemishes; has not clogged my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very humid climate, and very often have trouble with gel-type creams.  Not so in this case.  This Gold Foil Cream from Alluricare does NOT sit on the surface of my skin; it does NOT stay tacky way too long, and it does NOT feel like a film drying on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to be careful to use just a small dab.  And, really, that is all I need, because it spreads on thinly and easily.  If I use too much, my skin is not able to absorb it all.  The directions say to spread it on the face and lightly massage it in until absorbed.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful citrus-y fragrance--kind of like a bubbly 7Up--that does not linger.  But it sure does smell nice and it lifts my spirits as I apply it and massage it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample from Alluricare.</li>
            <li> ALLURICARE Face Mask is a true anti-aging cream that is not sold in salons and comes with a 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few age spots and wrinkles so I thought I would try this beauty gel.  I am noticing a difference already.  This gel is firming my face, reducing the wrinkles, and diminishing the lines on my face.  With the essential oils and the Vitamin C Serum, my face is looking younger than it has for quite some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this beauty face mask, helping with my wrinkles and line, its also firming my face and neck areas.  I am using this three times a week per the instructions.  It does not take much of this beauty gel.  A little bit goes a long way.  I simply rub it into my face until the gel is absorbed.  I am satisfied with the results that this has and is continuing to give my face and neck areas.  I like the idea of getting salon results, without having to purchase this in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this facial mask is fantastic.  It has a citrus smell, but not too powerful.  It actually leaves me feeling refreshed.  The Gold that is in it replenishes the skin and leaves the skin feeling smoother.  I am satisfied with this gel and what it is doing for my face and neck.  I enjoy waking up in the morning feeling more refreshed and a since of rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a product at a free or reduced price.  All opinions are 100% my own, regardless.</li>
            <li> The Alluricare 24k Gold Foil Cream facial mask was sent to me as part of a review program recently.  While I do not have a lot of wrinkles or problems on my face, I was intrigued about testing it out to tighten, nourish and moisturize my face.  This cream contains real 24k gold flecks that are said to help make your skin even healthier.  The light citrusy scent is pleasant and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream was easy to apply - a little goes a long way.  For me, it ended up leaving a bit of a sticky feeling that just didn&#x27;t want to go away unless I wiped my face off or used a bit of powder.  I rarely wear makeup, so it felt like it was a bit useless to me if I was wiping it right off.  I did however feel like my face was much softer after using the cream.  I can&#x27;t say that in the couple of weeks I have used it I see any real difference in my skin.  I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it, which is good since I have highly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it could easily be great for someone with a bit more damage to their skin than I currently have. It&#x27;s definitely moisturizing.  If you wear makeup, it would make a great moisturizer before bedtime (where stickiness wouldn&#x27;t matter as much), or under your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a deep discount in exchange for my review here.</li>
