            <li>This is a nice shampoo, although I do not like the packaging, which seems deliberately designed to squeeze out way more product than you need so that you will have to repurchase faster.</li>

            <li>Save your money and go to a salon where they sell the real deal!!!  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the stylist size from Amazon, as I&#x27;ve had such good luck with this product.</li>
            <li>It really lathers easily and smells divine.  </li>
            <li>the cap is tiny and the product is NOT THE AUTHENTIC ENJOY SHAMPOO OR CONDITIONER.  </li>
            <li>Soft and lovely hair.</li>
            <li>The color has really stayed true as well.  </li>
            <li>Some of the online prices seem higher than in the store (Planet Beauty $36 33oz shampoo and $54 for luxury conditioner)</li>
            <li>The products are thick and smell great.  </li>
            <li>You definitely pay more because of it.</li>
            <li>It is the only new thing I have introduced so I am sure that this is the culprit.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of lathering, and you only need a small amount (it goes a long way) I have long color treated hair and a large coin size works great.</li>
            <li>Bought this after hearing so much about the conditioner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be sulfate free, though it lists Olefin Sulfonate, a surfactant, as the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>product is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>Yes, you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>I had a stylist recommend this to me after coloring my hair, and I&#x27;ve used many other products since, but nothing has compared.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something that would be luxurious for my hair and make it really soft, and well this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is partly due to Enjoy &#x27;s high quality.  </li>
            <li>The girl that does my hair recommended this - and wow!  </li>
            <li>so really the cost isn&#x27;t that high overall.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates my hair so thoroughly and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny, even after bleaching.</li>
            <li>naturally curly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very bummed because it made my hair look and feel healthier than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It IS a little thick, but the scent is nice, and overall it leaves your hair feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li>They tame my flyaways and make wet combing easy.  </li>
            <li>It truly only takes a tiny amount, which is nice because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my long dry, curly, coarse, color-treated hair.  </li>

            <li> I color my hair and blow dry each day which had dried my hair out quite a bit. I found this brand at a beauty supply store and it is a miracle worker for my hair. It is very expensive but well worth it since it does not take much to shampoo and condition my hair.I use the regular shampoo and the luxury conditioner, works well this way and helps keep costs down by not using the luxury shampoo. My sister used it when she visited and way also very impressed with it. I tried to change to a less expensive line in the professional hair product lines and wish I had not since my hair is dry again.  Some of the online prices seem higher than in the store (Planet Beauty $36 33oz shampoo and $54 for luxury conditioner)</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I have used in my entire life.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all and its really hard to wash it all out of my hair because its the consistancy of glue.  I really wanted something that would be luxurious for my hair and make it really soft, and well this isn&#x27;t it.  I should have just bought the Alterna I had used before instead of wasting my money.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used. I had a stylist recommend this to me after coloring my hair, and I&#x27;ve used many other products since, but nothing has compared. It IS a little thick, but the scent is nice, and overall it leaves your hair feeling much healthier. I decided to purchase the stylist size from Amazon, as I&#x27;ve had such good luck with this product.</li>

            <li> I have never found a shampoo that equals this one. It hydrates my hair so thoroughly and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny, even after bleaching.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product for my dry, colored hair.  It just took a little bit but made a big difference in the texture of my hair.  I could tell an immediate difference as I was blow drying it.  However, the next morning I broke out with hives all over my scalp, face, and back.  It is the only new thing I have introduced so I am sure that this is the culprit.  I&#x27;m very bummed because it made my hair look and feel healthier than it has in a long time.  Wish they could make this product hypoallergenic for those of us who are sensitive to scents and other like ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. The only sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually lathers and makes me feel like I&#x27;ve truly cleaned my hair. Also love they don&#x27;t test on animals which is a MUST for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this after hearing so much about the conditioner and it is super! I have really long hair--to the middle of my back and naturally curly. A little goes a LONG way. Expensive but will probably last months--use about a nickel size since it foams up so well. Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great buy and my wife loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> The girl that does my hair recommended this - and wow!  I love it.  This is truly a luxury shampoo.  A tiny bit goes a really long way so really the cost isn&#x27;t that high overall.  My hair is softer but responds to styling better than it ever has.  The color has really stayed true as well.  Plan on using Enjoy for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this shampoo.  I got it from my salon, but I got the peach scent instead.  It smells great and it makes my hair really clean and soft - easily workable.  I think it&#x27;s a newer brand, but I wholeheartedly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is nice and very rich. It&#x27;s supposed to be sulfate free, though it lists Olefin Sulfonate, a surfactant, as the second ingredient. I&#x27;m no chemist, but it sounds like that may be similar to a sulfate, or possibly a derivative of one. It lathers, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting; the other sulfate-free products I&#x27;ve used in the past do not lather at all. (Maybe this is what the Olefin Sulfonate does? As I said, I&#x27;m not a chemist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very concentrated. It truly only takes a tiny amount, which is nice because it&#x27;s so expensive. I&#x27;ve found that if I thoroughly soak my hair for at least one full minute, even up to 90 seconds, before applying the product, it requires less to do the job. I currently have a very short bob cut, and I typically use a dime-sized dot of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that regular use of this shampoo lengthens the life of my hair color and shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be the only bad review on here, but I had to quit using this product. It was recommended to me by several people and I tried it for about 3 weeks. Yes, you don&#x27;t have to use much. Yes, it lathers easily. Yes, it smells divine. But other than those 3 things, I didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair other than IT STARTED FALLING OUT! Huge bald spots in my hairline so it was visible! OMG. As soon as I realized that the only change I had made recently was this shampoo and conditioner, I stopped using it immediatly and my hair stopped falling out. I just hope it grows back in sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> Enjoy is my favorite shampoo.  It really lathers easily and smells divine.  Makes my hair (colored) shiny &amp; smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.... I don&#x27;t like things with a lot of fragrance, but I find this to be pleasant. Does a great job of lathering, and you only need a small amount (it goes a long way) I have long color treated hair and a large coin size works great. Matching conditioner is a must, they work awesome together!</li>
            <li> If I could give NEGATIVE STARS, I would  first, the product bottle is not as described in the photo.  the cap is tiny and the product is NOT THE AUTHENTIC ENJOY SHAMPOO OR CONDITIONER.  my hair was INSTANTLY dried out and my color faded.  I am still trying to restore the moisture but will need a salon moisturizing treatment to return it to its pre-IMITATION ENJOY condition.  what a scam!  i will NEVER buy shampoo or any other hair care product on Amazon EVER AGAIN.  Save your money and go to a salon where they sell the real deal!!!  DON&#x27;T DO IT DON&#x27;T DO IT DON&#x27;T BUY IT DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I alternate between this and purology purple line.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!!! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found in a long time. -- Also love the conditioner and spray on conditioning spray products by Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Introduced to Enjoy line of products at hairdresser.  Works great with Enjoy conditioner.  Made my hair silky and bouncy.  Great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING and leaves my hair feeling silky.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo, although I do not like the packaging, which seems deliberately designed to squeeze out way more product than you need so that you will have to repurchase faster.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite! Keeps my color and makes my curls bounce!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that gently cleanses your hair.  Smells wonderful.  Just need a small amount to do the trick.  Leaves hair shiny and manageable.  Hairdresser uses all Enjoy products and recommended to me that I use them.  Have not disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;enjoy &amp;#34; this line of hair care products.  I have used both the Luxury shampoo and conditioner.  They are gentle on my long dry, curly, coarse, color-treated hair.  They tame my flyaways and make wet combing easy.  The products are thick and smell great.  My hair, although I am 48, is still thick.  I believe this is partly due to Enjoy &#x27;s high quality.  You definitely pay more because of it.</li>
            <li> For the price, I personally didn&#x27;t like this shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it preserved my color on my hair and I think there is better shampoo out there for a cheaper price</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for damaged hair. Soft and lovely hair.</li>
