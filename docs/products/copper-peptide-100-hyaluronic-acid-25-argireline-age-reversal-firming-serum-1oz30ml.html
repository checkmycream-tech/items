            <li> Soaks right in.  Skin feels good.</li>
            <li> A great and useful product every woman should include in their daily moisturizing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service and showed up as scheduled</li>
            <li> It was to harsh on my skin and it broke out so I was unable to us it . I have delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast. I recommend this company. I would choose more stars.</li>
            <li> I am 1/2 way through the first bottle I ordered and just ordered a second. I have an old scar on my face (20 years old) and I was hopeful but didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. I can say that this has helped the scar a great deal. It is still visable but it seems to have reduced in height. sunken more into the surrounding skin. That and my pores have shrunken as well. My skin looks like it dod in my 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s so I am very happy and recommend it to anyone looking to have pretty skin. You use this twice a day for the best results. A drop covers almost all your face so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the feel of this product on my skin, but could not tell if it made any difference.  This product probably has to be used for awhile to see or feel a change in skin texture.  I would not hesitate to buy this product at another time.</li>
            <li> I gave this a four, instead of a five stars, because it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker . That being said , I have been pleased with the results. My old acne scars are less obvious , and I feel that my skin is firmer.i am on my second bottle. That should tell you something .</li>
            <li> Unsure what this does, other than lubricate the needle to help it glide on the skin.</li>
            <li> You didn&#x27;t say that it was made and coming  from  China</li>
            <li> I am seeing results already! My skin feel thicker and more supple at the same time. i LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product took two weeks to get here from out of the country and arrives on time as scheduled. I gave been using it with vitamin c serum and hydroquinone 2% and my face looks clear and bright. This combination works do well for me and I will encourage others to try it. Great combination.</li>
            <li> It is working fine, I hope to see results soon</li>
            <li> The smoothness and glow in my skin really came out. Love this product.</li>
            <li> wife says its good. but why does it come from china only. don&#x27;t trust much Chinese stuff nowadays</li>
            <li> This at night along with Vitamin C during the day(DIY serum) along with facercise have taken 10 to 15 years off my appearance.  My skin looked uneven and splotchy, now my skin looks glowing.  The collagen production has definitely gone up.  The price for this is more than a bargain.  I have used many different combinations of products, and this product definitely works.</li>
            <li> This product will always be on my shopping list. It&#x27;s a must.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your skin moist and helps reduce the size of the pores.</li>
            <li> Definitely benefitial when using a derma roller! Best reseluts seen in the morning after using at bedtime. Temporary firmness yet definitely noticeable. I stopped for a week but if used regularly, this product helps for sure. (I used it for cheek acne scaring and will continue to do so)</li>
            <li> I like this product has greatly improved my skin texture. I have used this nightly for two months with needle roller in order to penetrate skin better. My skin looks very nice, but I also use sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Knock off item from China</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this product helped to improve my scars and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for such. You&#x27;d be much better off using that money for good silicone scar sheets and silicone gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Well work the wait! Delivered as stated!i&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used excellent skin products for years  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and have good skin. Read about this product decided to try . using Pepcide product with Erni oil for about a month every night and can see a big difference. If your consistent you definitely will see results!&lt;br /&gt;Definite 5 Star!</li>
            <li> It took awhile to arrive, and I was a little nervous about using it since it was sent from China.  Products from China have such a bad rap.  I would feel better if it was made in US.  However, I am using it in conjunction with a retinol product also purchased here at Amazon as well as a a collagen product.  My face looks great.  Wrinkles are disappearing.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum, after a certain amount of time (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone), you can see wrinkles diminish and clearer skin. There are two problems, 1) it takes about a month to get to you once ordered and 2) if you stop using the product your skin begins to regress.</li>
