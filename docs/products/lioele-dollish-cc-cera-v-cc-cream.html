            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>i kind works for me but its not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>One pump is the perfect amount for my whole face and still covers my blemishes.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>The coverage is nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full coverage while not looking cakey, so it&#x27;s great for a no-makeup makeup look.</li>
            <li>Being fair, it is moisture, it is easy to blend out, it does not block my pore.</li>
            <li>coverage is amazing for a cc cream; like i said, many ppl believe it to be like a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>I wanted something with SPF that would also give my skin a pretty finish - this accomplishes it beautifully.</li>
            <li>Awesome coverage for a CC cream and amazing how it comes out as a white  moisturizer, yet changes to match your skin tone as soon as u start blending...</li>
            <li>I saw a first impression review on you tube which sparked my interest, and I&#x27;m happy w/the results.</li>
            <li>If you have very light skin tone, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Make sure to blend well, works best when applied with fingers or with wet sponge to warm the product into the skin and give it a nice texture.</li>
            <li>I have bought more Lioele from the store itself.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just glad it matches my skin</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bb cream.</li>
            <li>Love Korean bb creams</li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff, but it&#x27;s darker than my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Also really cute packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but come on, how many times can you powder your face in a day?</li>
            <li>But I still love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture - The Skin79 cream feels like sun tan lotion in terms of thickness but the CC cream is lighter and feels more like lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing in the winter and acts as a great base/primer in the summer.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but this does more than that.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a bit more product or lower price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I really do love it.</li>
            <li>Still, I would consider this more &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I still love it, just have to blend it with the neck :)</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for.  </li>
            <li>but overall it is the BEST bb/cc cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>When I saw that this was color changing, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really does blend right into the skin, and creates the most beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>Now I make sure I apply the cream with one hand and use a finger on my clean hand to go over my face to make sure the cream is applied evenly.</li>
            <li>It applied beautifully on the back of my hand for the allergy test, and it was ok looking on my face.</li>
            <li>Its full coverage !</li>
            <li>I recommend using moisturizer before use or it will settle into the fine lines, crevices and acne scars.</li>
            <li>Liquids can seep into any fine lines etc.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This cc cream cover my acne lightly.</li>
            <li>Once the product came, I noticed how cheap the packaging seemed.</li>
            <li>Good coverage unless you have huge zits haha :) fast shipping too</li>
            <li>but it was too light for me and let me tell u</li>
            <li>Lol I&#x27;ll still use it though, just going to have to do extra stuff for it to match.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, AMAZING. Will absolutely buy again soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too light in color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just 100% fabulous.</li>
            <li>Too light for Medium but covers well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin as well; the tone is more even and my skin is a lot more</li>
            <li>Omg I love this so much!  </li>
            <li>;) love it ...</li>
            <li>The texture and blending ability aren&#x27;t anything special either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like a full coverage foundation</li>
            <li>On good skin days, the coverage is enough to wear it alone.</li>
            <li>It gives you a dewy glow (good for dryer skins who chose that look) but for me, it only makes me look greasier.</li>
            <li>I think it gives light to half medium coverage if that makes sense still very nice.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly &amp; really hydrates your skin will repurchase!!</li>
            <li>and my face looks so even and pretty!</li>
            <li>I watched a youtube review of this and thought the color-changing aspect of it was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>thats fun reaction to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is really nice and adapts my skin tone so well, that i really dont look like wearing makeup, it gives your skin a natural glow</li>
            <li>At first it scared me, but it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; quickly and mattifies a bit.</li>
            <li>All that help cover my red active acnes and create flawless look.</li>
            <li>It blended right into my skin tone and evened it out.</li>
            <li>i have very oily skin but as long as I pair this with a powder I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting a matte powder because this product leave your face looking very shiny but other than that, amazing!</li>
            <li>Such a great CC cream, obviously it will wear off by the end of the day if you&#x27;re doing a lot like any makeup.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>My first cc cream and</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Which is a first.</li>
            <li>I love how it turns white to skin color</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m totally into keeping my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>I use primer and a TINY bit of concealer and top it off with this</li>
            <li>Love the color changing from white to skin color.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>After seeing videos on YouTube like another poster, I was excited to try this cream and expecting a little more out of</li>
            <li>At first after applying it, there&#x27;s a very dewy, shiney look to it.</li>
            <li>The Delivery was right away and thank you so much for the other free sample!</li>
            <li>This is a very dewy be cream.</li>
            <li>It really brightens your look..</li>
            <li>I had high expectations and they were met!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I received my item fast.</li>
            <li>Also its very moisturizing without making me oily .</li>
            <li>If anything, it looks more dewy than wet.</li>
            <li>Like a majority of the customers who bought this product, i did my research on this cc cream and came across elainemokk&#x27;s yt video and seeing a product &amp;#34;in action&amp;#34; really got me wanting to give it a try</li>
            <li>gotta use fingers to blend, if u don&#x27;t mind doing that, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Does have a smell ,but I really like it, smells like sun screen.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, resulting in a very dewy look after applying.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the pump white and a bit runny like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have a light to medium complexion with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I will say its only for light skinned people and not suited to those with darker skin tones because the coverage is too high to look goof on someone with darker skin.</li>
            <li>though, i only wear makeup on special occasions now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white and turns into my skin color which is so cool.</li>
            <li>This is not a true Korean brand and although it is not a knock-off brand, I personally do not think this is good for your skin at all.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I do use this on a daily basis , but only for sunscreen purposes and to brighten the skin a tad more, not for coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for anything in pumps, and the colors are adorable!</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High coverage</li>
            <li>And to the reviews that says it makes their face look wet, my face looked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a medium coverage cc cream, evens out my skintone, gets rid of my dark circles, and has a nice lasting power to it as well!</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product on amazon back when it first came out and when it was listed for $35 but its really worth the amount</li>
            <li>I run through different products very erratically, so any product that stays in my arsenal for over 3 months has to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it does look very natural and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>but when it came in the mail today and I tried it out, it was completely orange!</li>
            <li>doesnt look dry throughiut the day or oily, it gives off a fresh dewy glow but not too oily looking.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say it&#x27;s a more lighter coverage, does take away the redness of the face, but doesn&#x27;t hide blemishes or dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>Price is a little high but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I tend to like a medium to full coverage without looking like I am wearing heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would also suggest using moisturizer before applying this cream(didn&#x27;t help me much) to deal with the dry patches and any imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pale, so I&#x27;m not suprised at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the hot pink Skin79</li>
            <li>- you have to make sure the cream is thinly applied on your skin or it will build up a crusty patch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for any major coverage issues you might be focusing on, but it does give a pretty little finish to your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid user of both bb creams and cc creams as they do not clog your pores like normal foundations and feels lighter; but with previous bad expirence of using cc creams i was really reluctant to buy this product.(thinking it would act more like a sheer coverage tinted moisturizer)</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the first time a year ago, and since then it&#x27;s been an everyday staple in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>I would recommend people who have lighter skin tone or pretty pale to try it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a full coverage foundation</li>
            <li> On good skin days, the coverage is enough to wear it alone.</li>
            <li> It gives you a dewy glow (good for dryer skins who chose that look) but for me, it only makes me look greasier.</li>
            <li> I think it gives light to half medium coverage if that makes sense still very nice.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; really hydrates your skin will repurchase!!</li>
            <li> and my face looks so even and pretty!</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube review of this and thought the color-changing aspect of it was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> thats fun reaction to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice and adapts my skin tone so well, that i really dont look like wearing makeup, it gives your skin a natural glow</li>
            <li> At first it scared me, but it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; quickly and mattifies a bit.</li>
            <li> All that help cover my red active acnes and create flawless look.</li>
            <li> It blended right into my skin tone and evened it out.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin but as long as I pair this with a powder I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting a matte powder because this product leave your face looking very shiny but other than that, amazing!</li>
            <li> Such a great CC cream, obviously it will wear off by the end of the day if you&#x27;re doing a lot like any makeup.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> My first cc cream and</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Which is a first.</li>
            <li> I love how it turns white to skin color</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m totally into keeping my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> I use primer and a TINY bit of concealer and top it off with this</li>
            <li> Love the color changing from white to skin color.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> After seeing videos on YouTube like another poster, I was excited to try this cream and expecting a little more out of</li>
            <li> At first after applying it, there&#x27;s a very dewy, shiney look to it.</li>
            <li> The Delivery was right away and thank you so much for the other free sample!</li>
            <li> This is a very dewy be cream.</li>
            <li> It really brightens your look..</li>
            <li> I had high expectations and they were met!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I received my item fast.</li>
            <li> Also its very moisturizing without making me oily .</li>
            <li> If anything, it looks more dewy than wet.</li>
            <li> Like a majority of the customers who bought this product, i did my research on this cc cream and came across elainemokk&#x27;s yt video and seeing a product &amp;#34;in action&amp;#34; really got me wanting to give it a try</li>
            <li> gotta use fingers to blend, if u don&#x27;t mind doing that, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does have a smell ,but I really like it, smells like sun screen.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, resulting in a very dewy look after applying.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the pump white and a bit runny like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have a light to medium complexion with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I will say its only for light skinned people and not suited to those with darker skin tones because the coverage is too high to look goof on someone with darker skin.</li>
            <li> though, i only wear makeup on special occasions now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white and turns into my skin color which is so cool.</li>
            <li> This is not a true Korean brand and although it is not a knock-off brand, I personally do not think this is good for your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I do use this on a daily basis , but only for sunscreen purposes and to brighten the skin a tad more, not for coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anything in pumps, and the colors are adorable!</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High coverage</li>
            <li> And to the reviews that says it makes their face look wet, my face looked fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a medium coverage cc cream, evens out my skintone, gets rid of my dark circles, and has a nice lasting power to it as well!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product on amazon back when it first came out and when it was listed for $35 but its really worth the amount</li>
            <li> I run through different products very erratically, so any product that stays in my arsenal for over 3 months has to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it does look very natural and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> but when it came in the mail today and I tried it out, it was completely orange!</li>
            <li> doesnt look dry throughiut the day or oily, it gives off a fresh dewy glow but not too oily looking.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say it&#x27;s a more lighter coverage, does take away the redness of the face, but doesn&#x27;t hide blemishes or dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Price is a little high but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I tend to like a medium to full coverage without looking like I am wearing heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest using moisturizer before applying this cream(didn&#x27;t help me much) to deal with the dry patches and any imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pale, so I&#x27;m not suprised at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the hot pink Skin79</li>
            <li> - you have to make sure the cream is thinly applied on your skin or it will build up a crusty patch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for any major coverage issues you might be focusing on, but it does give a pretty little finish to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of both bb creams and cc creams as they do not clog your pores like normal foundations and feels lighter; but with previous bad expirence of using cc creams i was really reluctant to buy this product.(thinking it would act more like a sheer coverage tinted moisturizer)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time a year ago, and since then it&#x27;s been an everyday staple in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I would recommend people who have lighter skin tone or pretty pale to try it.</li>
            <li> and  to be fair i have been sick</li>
            <li> the bottle is a lot smaller when you receive it even when I got it when it was marked down to $17.00.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have, is that it doesn&#x27;t mattify fast and even with powder</li>
            <li> The bottle was smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m a little disappointed about is that surprisingly</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s nourishing my skin all day long!</li>
            <li> After moisturizing and applying the cream, I feel like I have gooey dry flakes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will probably have to look at some finishing powder to dry off the paint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesnt look cakey on your face, i have combination dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> , it turned out to be a little too dark for my SUPER pale color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old, so I usually stick to just powder foundations as a rule.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day!</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was expecting</li>
            <li> It feels like wet paint even though my face looks like it has a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does come off as a pink understone</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why it lessens the wet look</li>
            <li> but even when I apply it, it doesn&#x27;t look wet.</li>
            <li> Not like other cc ream</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re struggling with finding the correct shade, dry skin, uneven tone, wrinkles, or basically anything else</li>
            <li> I do have an oily t-zone, but I rarely get this crazy oily usually.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw in a few videos on You Tube that people who used it matched their skin</li>
            <li> CC creams are supposed to be sun block, face primer, tinted moisturizer, concealer in 1, but it gets oily after few hours post application.</li>
            <li> use this product year round, too.</li>
            <li> Although, on the darker spots, I would have to go over it a few times n conceal it with concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually NOT a huge fan of BB or CC creams.</li>
            <li> But, just the color is to pale for me</li>
            <li> pale as a ghost and for years I&#x27;ve struggled to find a shade of makeup that fits me.</li>
            <li> For pale, drier skin types.</li>
            <li> Looks darker than your usual color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is bulidable it might be</li>
            <li> This is a CC CREAM, which is usually compared to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale girl!</li>
            <li> On other days I put a thin layer of foundation over it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> However, it felt extremely thick and my skin could not breathe at all.</li>
            <li> Not good for oily skin girls.</li>
            <li> Is very thick consistency</li>
            <li> Color adjusts to approximately a NC 25.</li>
            <li> youre paying(especially now since it&#x27;s decreased in price).</li>
            <li> Not really :(</li>
            <li> NOT impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Then I get crazy oily and the redness of my skin starts showing through.</li>
            <li> For a color-correcting cream, this failed miserably.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have oil/combo skin. This cc cream cover my acne lightly. It smells like sum screen. I use face lotion, primer (option ), cc cream, lioele bb cream then sebum powder (help o oily skin). All that help cover my red active acnes and create flawless look. Remember don&#x27;t apply too much just thin layer; one pump enough my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have bought more Lioele from the store itself.</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube review of this and thought the color-changing aspect of it was pretty cool. Once the product came, I noticed how cheap the packaging seemed. This is not a true Korean brand and although it is not a knock-off brand, I personally do not think this is good for your skin at all. It applied beautifully on the back of my hand for the allergy test, and it was ok looking on my face. However, it felt extremely thick and my skin could not breathe at all. The smoothness of this lasts for about 30 minutes. Then I get crazy oily and the redness of my skin starts showing through. For a color-correcting cream, this failed miserably. I do have an oily t-zone, but I rarely get this crazy oily usually. NOT impressed at all. Wish I could have returned it...</li>
            <li> My first cc cream and I am in love! Would repurchase. Good coverage unless you have huge zits haha :) fast shipping too</li>
            <li> If you have very light skin tone, don&#x27;t bother. I know it SAYS it will adjust to any skin tone. Not. The texture and blending ability aren&#x27;t anything special either. Total disappointment. Plus, this seller is horrid. Product isn&#x27;t as described, but they refused to take returns. Whatever.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s amazing i wish it was matte but oh well that&#x27;s what powder is for I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m just glad it matches my skin</li>
            <li> Blends very nice with your own skin tone.</li>
            <li> This CC cream contains ceramides, and functions like a ceramide moisturizer. Perfect for dry skin. Medium coverage. Color adjusts to approximately a NC 25. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a full coverage foundation but it was too light for me and let me tell u I&#x27;m a pale girl!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bb cream. Matches my skin tone perfectly and I have never found a foundation that does until now. It does exactly what it says it does. Which is a first. This is a very dewy be cream. i have very oily skin but as long as I pair this with a powder I am good to go. Love Korean bb creams</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again! Hope it&#x27;ll last me a while though!</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff, but it&#x27;s darker than my skin tone. I&#x27;m super pale, so I&#x27;m not suprised at all. Lol I&#x27;ll still use it though, just going to have to do extra stuff for it to match. Meh. No big deal. Also really cute packaging. 👌💕</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Make sure to blend well, works best when applied with fingers or with wet sponge to warm the product into the skin and give it a nice texture. Has a great dewy finish and substantial coverage.</li>
            <li> This has no oil control at all. Not good for oily skin girls. Wanted to love it, but come on, how many times can you powder your face in a day?</li>
            <li> It really brightens your look.. It just oxidizes to your skin after 6-8 hours.. Looks darker than your usual color. But I still love this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations and they were met! I would suggest getting a matte powder because this product leave your face looking very shiny but other than that, amazing! It blended right into my skin tone and evened it out. It started to wear off on my problematic areas but I just touched it up with some powder and I was good. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Such a great CC cream, obviously it will wear off by the end of the day if you&#x27;re doing a lot like any makeup. I love how it turns white to skin color thats fun reaction to see. The SPF is great too and i&#x27;m totally into keeping my skin healthy. I wouldn&#x27;t say any makeup is acne prone though, i only wear makeup on special occasions now and my skin cleared up. The coverage is great for a CC cream. I will say its only for light skinned people and not suited to those with darker skin tones because the coverage is too high to look goof on someone with darker skin. Price is a little high but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> After seeing videos on YouTube like another poster, I was excited to try this cream and expecting a little more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a short list so you can get an idea of how the CC cream is.  I&#x27;ve only used the hot pink Skin79 so I&#x27;m no go to guru by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture - The Skin79 cream feels like sun tan lotion in terms of thickness but the CC cream is lighter and feels more like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage - I would say it&#x27;s on par with skin79. I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and it&#x27;s still visible after one application. Coverage is medium at best.  I would also suggest using moisturizer before applying this cream(didn&#x27;t help me much) to deal with the dry patches and any imperfections.  After moisturizing and applying the cream, I feel like I have gooey dry flakes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel - oily. I&#x27;ve had the cream on for over 2 hours now and it feels like I am still waiting for it to set. It feels like wet paint even though my face looks like it has a matte finish.  I will probably have to look at some finishing powder to dry off the paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use the cc cream until it runs out but will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 7.26.14 - The product is still a 3/5 for me a week or so later.  One thing I found out - you have to make sure the cream is thinly applied on your skin or it will build up a crusty patch.  I had a white beard on my chin for the day when I forgot to do so.  Now I make sure I apply the cream with one hand and use a finger on my clean hand to go over my face to make sure the cream is applied evenly.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I use this every single day! Goes on smoothly &amp; really hydrates your skin will repurchase!!</li>
            <li> Being fair, it is moisture, it is easy to blend out, it does not block my pore. But, just the color is to pale for me lol. I think that&#x27;s the end of this comment. I would recommend people who have lighter skin tone or pretty pale to try it.</li>
            <li> This product came very very fast which is always great! As for the product itself, AMAZING. Will absolutely buy again soon.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great</li>
            <li> Omg I love this so much!  The Delivery was right away and thank you so much for the other free sample!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! I use primer and a TINY bit of concealer and top it off with this and my face looks so even and pretty! It is dewy so if you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish this is not for you, but  I&#x27;d defiantly buy it again when this one runs out! Super fast shipping and I loved it came with samples</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected. It&#x27;s way too light in color</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw in a few videos on You Tube that people who used it matched their skin and I figure &amp;#34;a universal&amp;#34; product that anyone can use and not tote around a lot stuff that bulk up your purse. Boy was I wrong. I really really wanted to like this product. CC creams are supposed to be sun block, face primer, tinted moisturizer, concealer in 1, but it gets oily after few hours post application. I recommend using moisturizer before use or it will settle into the fine lines, crevices and acne scars. PLEASE DO NOT use for events where flash photography is involved, You will see a white film on your skin and this glob of shine all over. Trust me, this product will not see a repurchase coming from me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time a year ago, and since then it&#x27;s been an everyday staple in my makeup collection. I run through different products very erratically, so any product that stays in my arsenal for over 3 months has to really work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pale as a ghost and for years I&#x27;ve struggled to find a shade of makeup that fits me. When I saw that this was color changing, I was so excited! It really does blend right into the skin, and creates the most beautiful finish. It&#x27;s full coverage while not looking cakey, so it&#x27;s great for a no-makeup makeup look. On good skin days, the coverage is enough to wear it alone. On other days I put a thin layer of foundation over it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product year round, too. It&#x27;s very moisturizing in the winter and acts as a great base/primer in the summer. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin as well; the tone is more even and my skin is a lot more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great as well. I&#x27;m a sucker for anything in pumps, and the colors are adorable! I saved the box it came in just because it was so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with finding the correct shade, dry skin, uneven tone, wrinkles, or basically anything else, I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s just 100% fabulous.</li>
            <li> Not really :( i kind works for me but its not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied w/the product. I saw a first impression review on you tube which sparked my interest, and I&#x27;m happy w/the results. Just wish bottle was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I received my item fast. I have combination skin . Im a NC 15-20 . Its full coverage ! &amp; it doesn&#x27;t feel like your wearing make up . Is very thick consistency but once is on your face you dont feel it. Also its very moisturizing without making me oily . It does come off as a pink understone but I set it with a banana powder and it looks perfect . Im very pleased with this item. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for my very light complexion. One pump is the perfect amount for my whole face and still covers my blemishes. Love the color changing from white to skin color. Best match I&#x27;ve found for my skin tone. Only complaint I have, is that it doesn&#x27;t mattify fast and even with powder it looks dew-y. Overall I love this product and use it on a daily basis. Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> I will buy this from now on. I am in love with this product. And to the reviews that says it makes their face look wet, my face looked fine. If anything, it looks more dewy than wet. I do wear blush on my cheeks so maybe that&#x27;s why it lessens the wet look but even when I apply it, it doesn&#x27;t look wet. It&#x27;s white and turns into my skin color which is so cool. Great coverage too. Although, on the darker spots, I would have to go over it a few times n conceal it with concealer. The smaller pimples just disappear. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of both bb creams and cc creams as they do not clog your pores like normal foundations and feels lighter; but with previous bad expirence of using cc creams i was really reluctant to buy this product.(thinking it would act more like a sheer coverage tinted moisturizer) Like a majority of the customers who bought this product, i did my research on this cc cream and came across elainemokk&#x27;s yt video and seeing a product &amp;#34;in action&amp;#34; really got me wanting to give it a try myself.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is amazing for a cc cream; like i said, many ppl believe it to be like a tinted moisturizer but this does more than that. It&#x27;s a medium coverage cc cream, evens out my skintone, gets rid of my dark circles, and has a nice lasting power to it as well! I actually bought this product on amazon back when it first came out and when it was listed for $35 but its really worth the amount youre paying(especially now since it&#x27;s decreased in price). The bottle was smaller than i expected but i bought this sometime in the summer and i still have enough to last me for awhile. The shelf life is 12 months but i feel like it would last longer than that tbh :&#x27;D&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt look cakey on your face, i have combination dry and oily skin but it has a sufficent amount of sebum control my face doesnt look dry throughiut the day or oily, it gives off a fresh dewy glow but not too oily looking. It also has whitening so it&#x27;ll help with acne scars! I&#x27;ve seen an improvement and blur of my acnes scars as i have a lot around the temples. All in all i would definitly buy this product again and would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Too light for Medium but covers well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to purchase this cc cream in hopes of it matching my skin tone being that it starts off white but when it came in the mail today and I tried it out, it was completely orange! If you&#x27;re any lighter than an nc20 in mac then this probably won&#x27;t match you. Although it does look very natural and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice and adapts my skin tone so well, that i really dont look like wearing makeup, it gives your skin a natural glow and you dont need to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> High coverage ;) love it ... Not like other cc ream</li>
            <li> I kept watching videos and reading reviews on how wonderful this product is, however, I do not recommend this for oily/combo skin. It gives you a dewy glow (good for dryer skins who chose that look) but for me, it only makes me look greasier. I would definitely say it&#x27;s a more lighter coverage, does take away the redness of the face, but doesn&#x27;t hide blemishes or dark circles under the eyes. I do use this on a daily basis , but only for sunscreen purposes and to brighten the skin a tad more, not for coverage.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this stuff! Awesome coverage for a CC cream and amazing how it comes out as a white  moisturizer, yet changes to match your skin tone as soon as u start blending...gotta use fingers to blend, if u don&#x27;t mind doing that, I highly recommend! Does have a smell ,but I really like it, smells like sun screen.</li>
            <li> Good product, very nice feeling on the face and it smells nice. I like how it evens out my skin tone and provides coverage but I don&#x27;t think it covers redness that well I think it is because it is a color changing product and it changes from white to your skin color and  to be fair i have been sick so I had to conceal around my nose. The formula is a bit liquidity I&#x27;m not sure if it is bulidable it might be but I didn&#x27;t try to build up the coverage. I think it gives light to half medium coverage if that makes sense still very nice. It is a  bit pricey the bottle is a lot smaller when you receive it even when I got it when it was marked down to $17.00. I just wish there was a bit more product or lower price. Over all I do like it. They give free samples as well wonderful customer service on their part.</li>
            <li> . . . I&#x27;m usually NOT a huge fan of BB or CC creams. I&#x27;m 38 years old, so I usually stick to just powder foundations as a rule. Liquids can seep into any fine lines etc. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I really do love it. It&#x27;s not for any major coverage issues you might be focusing on, but it does give a pretty little finish to your skin. It doesn&#x27;t cover up any of my freckles (not my intention). I wanted something with SPF that would also give my skin a pretty finish - this accomplishes it beautifully.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, resulting in a very dewy look after applying. For pale, drier skin types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but for this I have to. I have never used anything comparable to this stuff. This is a CC CREAM, which is usually compared to a tinted moisturizer. It comes out of the pump white and a bit runny like a light moisturizer. BUUUUT when you start applying it, the color changes and blends into your skin. At first after applying it, there&#x27;s a very dewy, shiney look to it. At first it scared me, but it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; quickly and mattifies a bit. Still, I would consider this more &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;. It is SUPER moisturizing! I feel like it&#x27;s nourishing my skin all day long! The only thing I&#x27;m a little disappointed about is that surprisingly, it turned out to be a little too dark for my SUPER pale color! I still love it, just have to blend it with the neck :)</li>
            <li> perfect feel . great all day coverage . no breakouts .  what more could you ask for.  A little smaller than I was expecting so I wish the price was lowet. but overall it is the BEST bb/cc cream I have ever used.  I tend to like a medium to full coverage without looking like I am wearing heavy makeup.  This product delivers . ;-)</li>
            <li> The coverage is nice but it was not my color so I ended up wiping it off and returning it. I have a light to medium complexion with yellow undertones.</li>
