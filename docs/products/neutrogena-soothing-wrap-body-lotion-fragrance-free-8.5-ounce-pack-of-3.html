    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best product of its type on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion out there.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizing cream for the body and hands.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful hand and body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Its not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>Great body lotion.  </li>

            <li>This is a very effective product.  </li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to LOVE?!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>There is this one that contains oatmeal and dimethicone which I LOVE because it has a matte finish and when I use it on my face there is no shine at all!</li>
            <li>Im not a fan of fragrance of almost any kind when it comes to things I put on my body.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture to it.  </li>
            <li>Aquaphor is best for locking in the most moisture after baths, but it is very greasy and therefore not always practical.</li>
            <li>If there were a scent of any kind, I would not be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and this is by far the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li>As for moisturizing, it is perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>Great texture to the lotion, not too much.  </li>
            <li>and I promise you will love it.  </li>
            <li>and my skin can&#x27;t breathe with most lotions.</li>
            <li>Then when you love it like me order the larger size in quantity from Amazon and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li>This is an ok lotion for a guy.</li>
            <li>This particular size is a great value.</li>
            <li>Excellent, hydrating, non-sticky, soothing body lotion in easy to dispense tube is the most efficacious product for dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Soothing Wrap is the next best thing and soaks in quickly so we can go about our day.</li>
            <li>There is a VERY mild scent upon application that disappears within a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy and fragrance free...</li>
            <li>B002BWOY6G Neutrogena Soothing Wrap Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce (</li>
            <li>This one though labeled fragrance free has a hint of perfume to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>make sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li>I have been using Soothing Wrap for a couple of years now (ever since Neutrogena discontinued my favorite moisturizing lotion), and it is an absolute godsend for me and my kids.</li>
            <li>Love how it isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly into skin, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>They tend to stop making nearly all of their products after a time and make a new one siimilar but with some added enticements, not always duplicating the good.</li>
            <li>The only place I can find my favorite fragrance free Neutrogena lotion is on the Internet.  </li>
            <li>I thnk it is cost effective, bought several 3 packs and hope Neutrogena continues to offer this lotion.</li>

            <li>Only wish it were available in stores as well....</li>
            <li>Thanks to their consumer department for their suggestions.</li>
            <li>While the fragrance free version of this product may not smell sweet, i find it sufficiently neutral especially after a short period that lets it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>therefore it feels more greasy like your average</li>
            <li>While represented as \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, it actually does have a scent and that scent is more like an ODOR than the absence of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I found this Neutrogena Soothing Body Wrap a few years ago in Target and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  </li>
            <li>Will try to find it in normal store for that price</li>
            <li>I also am perplexed by the review that stated the product has an unpleasant odor -- as another reviewer stated, there is a slight, light, pleasant odor that disappears within seconds of the product being applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perplexed by the other review stating that this product has an odor.</li>
            <li>However, if your skin is sensitive buy the smaller size first.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I wish the stores near me carried this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging for both products look exactly the same, but what&#x27;s inside is very different.</li>
            <li>I have extrememly dry skin and feel that this product protects it very well.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance free is just that, other than the normal smell of a plain lotion.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena lotion helps her skin to soften, moisturize, and generally heal.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only place I can find my favorite fragrance free Neutrogena lotion is on the Internet.  It&#x27;s light and non-greasy and fragrance free... what&#x27;s not to LOVE?!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this product, Soothing Wrap, instead of the product that I&#x27;d intended to order, Moisture Wrap. The packaging for both products look exactly the same, but what&#x27;s inside is very different. Take care to double-check the label before ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed by the other review stating that this product has an odor. I have been using Soothing Wrap for a couple of years now (ever since Neutrogena discontinued my favorite moisturizing lotion), and it is an absolute godsend for me and my kids. There is a VERY mild scent upon application that disappears within a couple of seconds. If there were a scent of any kind, I would not be able to use it. As for moisturizing, it is perfect for daily use. Aquaphor is best for locking in the most moisture after baths, but it is very greasy and therefore not always practical. Soothing Wrap is the next best thing and soaks in quickly so we can go about our day. We love it!</li>
            <li> Great body lotion.  Not oily, feels great when you put it on.  Keeps skin very moist.  Great texture to the lotion, not too much.  Dries quickly into skin, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Good product... Only wish it were available in stores as well....that&#x27;s where i initially found it.</li>
            <li> I use the fragrance free version of all Neutrogena products, this product included, because the fragrance versions make me ill.  I have moderate asthma and severe allergies such that the fragrance makes it difficult for me to breath and gives me sinus headaches.  While the fragrance free version of this product may not smell sweet, i find it sufficiently neutral especially after a short period that lets it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Excellent, hydrating, non-sticky, soothing body lotion in easy to dispense tube is the most efficacious product for dry, itchy skin.  Does as it says and wraps the skin in a non-sticky, breathable (non-heavy) barrier to keep skin calm, hydrated and relieved of uncomfortable dryness and itchiness.  I Have been stocking up as the product is being discontinued/re-formulated by Neutrogena/J &amp; J and to date it&#x27;s the best product of its type on the market.  Called the manufacturer on their 800 # and they advised ordering off of Amazon.com or drugstore.com.  Thanks to their consumer department for their suggestions. [[ASIN:B002BWOY6G Neutrogena Soothing Wrap Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ll begin by saying being male Im not a fan of fragrance of almost any kind when it comes to things I put on my body. Even the ones supposedly made for men seem to have some sort of fruity or flowery concoction scent to it. NOT FOR ME. I foound this lotion at a marshalls discount store. It was all of 3 bux so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instant it hit my skin, I knew this was for me! like milk, an ink pen or credit card has a smell, yes, even unscented things have a smell. SO if you are kanin like in your sense of smell you will smell SOMETHING. But its the lack of fragrance this product boasts. However it smells like NOTHING to me and that&#x27;s just what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 version of this lotion on shelved. There is this one that contains oatmeal and dimethicone which I LOVE because it has a matte finish and when I use it on my face there is no shine at all! It gives my skin a velvet like look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the NEW formula which has no oatmeal and less dimethicone therefore it feels more greasy like your average lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also the 10.5 ounce bottle with pump labeled clinical strength. This one though labeled fragrance free has a hint of perfume to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it all depends on what you are looking for this lotions to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last all day? For me, yes. My skin felt moisturized and protected from the elements literally ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free, unless you have a dogs sens of smell it smells like nothing. Like milk or water has a smell, this smells like that...nothing. It is however truly FRAGRANCE free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you get the right one. I think They are discontinuing the formula with oatmeal for the one with lanolin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and was disappointed that the company has recently cut back on distribution in some geographic areas. The lotion goes on smoothly and does not have a greasy feeling. I have very dry skin during the winter season and Soothing Wrap relieves the itchy feeling brought on by indoor heating systems. I also am perplexed by the review that stated the product has an unpleasant odor -- as another reviewer stated, there is a slight, light, pleasant odor that disappears within seconds of the product being applied. It is possible that the reviewer who complained about an unpleasant smell may have received a bad batch or an out-of-date product. I do not hesitate to recommend Soothing Wrap.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Soothing Body Lotion, Fragrance Free keeps my body supple.  This is a very effective product.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I found this Neutrogena Soothing Body Wrap a few years ago in Target and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  Do not get confused, there are two different Soothing Wraps that Neutrogena makes.  This one however stops itchiness from dry skin instantly - the one I&#x27;m finding in stores now doesn&#x27;t.  If you need relief from dry itchy skin, please try this and I promise you will love it.  And this is a pack of 3!!  I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and this is by far the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  Just a little mad at myself that it took me two and a half years to think to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> While this is an excellent body lotion (read my review of the product that is NOT fragrance free), the fragrance free product STINKS. While represented as \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, it actually does have a scent and that scent is more like an ODOR than the absence of fragrance. Pew.</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is the best lotion out there.  Frustrated not to be able to buy locally in the unscented.  Love how it isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> Purchase the three pack constantly, very unhappy of the recent increase of nearly $10.00.  Will try to find it in normal store for that price</li>
            <li> This is the real deal -- a wonderfully thick and soothing hand lotion. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies, all citrus, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, pollen, etc...boring... and this product does not bother me in the least. It applies easily, is not greasy so does not soil your clothers or bedding. I apply it before bed in the winter since we have such a dry climate and cold. It stops the ithching and keeps my skin manageable, otherwise it begins to take on reptile tendencies. It is soothing after being in the sun. I thnk it is cost effective, bought several 3 packs and hope Neutrogena continues to offer this lotion. They tend to stop making nearly all of their products after a time and make a new one siimilar but with some added enticements, not always duplicating the good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizing cream for the body and hands.  I have extrememly dry skin and feel that this product protects it very well.  It has a nice texture to it.  I have purchased it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive and difficult product to find. My skin reacts strangely to different &amp;#34;skin care&amp;#34; products. Usually, I feel like I&#x27;m in a casket and my skin can&#x27;t breathe with most lotions. I&#x27;ve used this for years and swear by it. However, I DO NOT USE IT ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;I will  continue to use this product. This particular size is a great value. However, if your skin is sensitive buy the smaller size first. Then when you love it like me order the larger size in quantity from Amazon and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful hand and body lotion.  My skin has never been softer.  I wish the stores near me carried this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena lotion for my 90-year-old mother, who must wear compression stockings.  The skin on her legs was extremely dried out and irritated.  Neutrogena lotion helps her skin to soften, moisturize, and generally heal.</li>
            <li> This is an ok lotion for a guy. Its not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned but it does the job. The fragrance free is just that, other than the normal smell of a plain lotion. It absorbs pretty well, but stayed a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; for me.</li>
