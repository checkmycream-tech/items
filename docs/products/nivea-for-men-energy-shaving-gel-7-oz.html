            <li>In all seriousness, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought from amazon.</li>
            <li>OMG IM 61 AND HAD THE BEST SHAVE OF MY LIFE THIS MORNING</li>
            <li>One of the best.</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I made the mistake of assuming Amazon had the best price on my items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea is the best in the end.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made in Germany which is probably the best thing about it.  </li>

            <li>Great smell that lingers on for a while.  </li>
            <li>The Energy gel smells great, and the label indicates it contains Taurine and Q10 to energize the skin.</li>

            <li>Of course, for the price, this is a great deal and will do if you are on a budget.</li>

            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>This one smells and feels great , got it for my husband</li>
            <li>No nicks, fully moisturizes the scalp, and comes at great price.</li>
            <li>and it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent skin lubrication---considerably better than the air-fluff foam shave lotions.</li>
            <li>This is easily one of the best shaving gels I have used.  </li>
            <li>great product ,great price ,you will love the shave you get .&lt;br /&gt;Stephen</li>
            <li>some not so good</li>
            <li>My husband loved using it.</li>
            <li>I would not call it supreme but is good.</li>
            <li>This is good shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about this gel and wanted to give it a try because all I&#x27;ve been using was the cheapest off the counter shaving gels I could find at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the pack of 3 is good for 9 months and with that price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>That was a good decision.</li>
            <li>it gives a really good shave and</li>
            <li>It uses aluminum for bottling, which is good.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Also, a pack of 3 for so cheap is a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a joke, but it is a good shave gel.</li>
            <li>but it is good</li>
            <li>and I get a good shave from it.</li>
            <li>, i bought them based on their cheaper price, in reality you can find cheaper at CVS but the product is good</li>
            <li>good smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price was good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, i use Barbasol for that&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Loved the bottles also.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave gel, I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nivea and they have not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best shaving cream on the general market and great scent!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who wants a great shave and an awesome scent to go along with it.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the Nivea for Men Q 10.  </li>
            <li>and he is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it was amazing experience.</li>
            <li>Nice gel, good hydration.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good shave that doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical fragrance, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Easy, breasy, beautiful cover girl.</li>
            <li>Great lather, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shaving gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It also gives me a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Nice dispenser too</li>
            <li>Decided to treat myself to some nice shave gel.</li>
            <li>Smells good without being too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Nivea Q10 does a nice moistening job so my skin can wait for a while after I get out of the shower and shave; used to be that I had to run to the face cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know to be honest.</li>
            <li>The gel in this kind is softer and drippier; it&#x27;s got an almost...snotty consistency.</li>
            <li>Couple this with a nice razor</li>
            <li>and it mixes into a nice thickness.</li>
            <li>it is nice on skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome scent, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for a smooth clean shave and no irretation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, smells good, works really well and is the best shaving cream he has ever used.</li>
            <li>The gel spreads very easily and provides a slippery surface to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li>I cut very easily and this limits those to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fine after using so good buy.</li>
            <li>The gel is economical, provides excellent lather, and has a clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By far the best shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 10 years and this is by far the best shaving gel I&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, smells good and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>smells nice and smells stays for a while love it</li>
            <li>Its kind of a lemony refreshing smell that wakes you up but for me I use cologne and I like to smell the cologne I am wearing and with this until the smell fades it</li>
            <li>Excellent Gel and gives pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very light fresh, clean scent, and provides excellent moisture.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it amazing, but after the 5-6 different brands of shaving creams/gels I&#x27;ve found this the best.</li>
            <li>All of this amounts to a very comfortable and relaxed shave that softened my beard and made shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>Gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>so you need to use more product than you should</li>
            <li>I needed a boost to try to get a better shave.</li>
            <li>This is much better than Gillette Fusion shave gel.  </li>
            <li>And if you give it 2 or 3 minutes to soak in it really works great.</li>
            <li>I get an incredibly close shave, the price is reasonable, and my face feels much more comfortable for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I will be ording more</li>
            <li>so I am using more of this than more people would use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is  okay.  </li>
            <li>Interesting marketing.</li>
            <li>This is better than Edge.</li>
            <li>This is a GEL not a cream, which is much better in my view.</li>
            <li>This seems to have alleviated this problem and my skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say this is my favorite of all shaving gels I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>What more do they want you to say?  </li>
            <li>Better than going to the store</li>
            <li>Shaving against the grain is easier because it seems to have either more or better lubricants.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make shaving any more luxurious --</li>
            <li>Definitely the best shaving cream/gel on the market.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette&#x27;s shaving foam, and this product is definitely better.  </li>
            <li>more for my dad as well.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>Seriously glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>and though I doubt the claims of &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; haha, it really is a great shaving lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They claim there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one though, since, when I bought it, it was a better deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Well, OK, that might be overstating it a bit...</li>
            <li>more tissue squares populating your face.</li>
            <li>it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting the outstanding performance of this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>On reaching home I discovered that the nozzle part at the top had come off even though the cap was still on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a rotary razor for years - and been pleased.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried every shaving cream/gel but have tried many.</li>
            <li>I will not be able to smell it ...</li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves my skin very nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but this stuff certainly makes it a significantly more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>I was reading about this on r/wicked_edge and it was highly rated and a great price.  </li>
            <li>pretty good product</li>
            <li>The price from amazing is great, and I know that I only have to buy maybe 2 times a year.</li>
            <li>Nice mild Fragrance.</li>
            <li>The gel tends to cluster up and does not have a refreshing or clean feel to it - I would recommend spending more for quality and looking at Proraso shave creams.</li>
            <li>The shave is smoother and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]] which works great.</li>
            <li>It makes my shaving experience alot more comfortable and it feels like it revives my skin in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not take much lotion for a good shave.</li>
            <li>The gel is not scented and very slippery, allowing for a good shave.</li>
            <li>Has nice smell and does the job, I get all the women now, the power of this product is quite enlightening</li>
            <li>Works really well, and it seems to be a good deal for the cost.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, this, and a real close</li>
            <li>best part was after every use it didn&#x27;t continue to drop or foam at the spray nozzle, an annoyance experienced quite frequently with other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li>use it too shave in the morning for a easy, and awaking shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are not a fan of strong smelling product then this would not be for you.</li>
            <li>For this price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B004E3ION4 Bic Comfort 3 Advance Disposable Razor for Men,  4-Count]]I have used high quality razors all my life some were good</li>
            <li>but honestly, the reviews about it are not wrong</li>
            <li>Kind of funny that every time I visit Walmart and look for Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles, there are always out.</li>
            <li>The shaving gel is fine.  </li>
            <li>and I get full coverage with great protection during the shave, even with old beat up blades.  </li>
            <li>My husband said that the product itself is just fine, but he does not like the smell</li>
            <li>If you like a musk odor or use musky cologne, this gel should be fine, but for me, it was off-</li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase more when finished with this first pack.</li>
            <li>, so some people might also agree this is a fine shaving cream.</li>
            <li>but works fine.</li>
            <li>This one did it and leaves my face so smooth.  </li>
            <li>triple blade smooth no pull .</li>
            <li>and I did need a gel that provides a closer but comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It may sound petty, but the stuff is a pain to get out of the can.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave -</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the way the can looks sitting on my counter.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap 99 cent can of Barbasol</li>
            <li>It leaves his skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels substantial and I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>it is a fresh scent and you will be able to smell it for atleast a couple of hours...</li>
            <li>Foamy and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>The lather is fantastic and smooth and a can lasts me a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>So amazing price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>softens the hair, and makes shaving easy and quick.</li>
            <li>it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, either, but it works just fine, and it&#x27;s definitely superior to some of the other brands out there.</li>
            <li>Shaves clean.</li>
            <li>Lats forever, helps you get a close clean shave, and with the price on the three pack, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different gels and this is, by far, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Nivea does have a slight pleasant smell to it and the moisturizer built in is probably better for your skin than cheap foam.  </li>
            <li>Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this like so many other good things I find.</li>
            <li>Cool and clean smell.</li>
            <li>When I bought this gel I was trying to cut costs on replacing gel for my Norelco Cool Skin Razor with gel conditioner dispenser ([[ASIN:B000UJZIEY Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System]])     </li>
            <li>I love this gel thanks.</li>
            <li>I like it better but can&#x27;t really provide a tangible reason as to why....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked this gel so far.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when I figured that out, because I love the smell of the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>The shaving gel overall is good, I use it to shave my head</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>and like it a lot better than the Energy shaving gel because it has more natural ingredients, is (IMO) better for my skin, and goes on clear so you can see what you are shaving.  </li>
            <li>For the same amount dispensed on both products, Nivea foams quite a bit more, and the foam seems to be more dense compared to Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin being more energized than normal??  </li>
            <li>To me this is the best out there, that I have tried at least!</li>
            <li>Honestly, gone through a lot of different shaving products, and this helps tremendously with razor burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a great shave with little irritation using this gel along with Dorco Pace 3 razor and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not to try something besides the cheapest available shaving cream, absolutely try this.</li>
            <li>GEL IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING WISH</li>
            <li>A very think gel thank keeps your face smooth and hydrated as you shave.</li>
            <li>really well keeping my skin intact and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly, I was able to shave using my shaving system.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, isn&#x27;t harsh, and is easily to shave and clean with.</li>
            <li>A better deal could have been had directly from Dorco.</li>
            <li>I rarely nick my face when using this shaving cream</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>The powerful, musky scent was intolerable to me and my wife.</li>
            <li>The cheap stuff actually gave me a better closer shave.  </li>
            <li>The can says something about supplying one&#x27;s skin with &amp;#34;new energy&amp;#34; or some such, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve noticed nothing of the kind.</li>
            <li>I felt made a good compromise between close shave, and minimal &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pressing on the top gives you a pump action to push the gel out.</li>
            <li>Great product - produces a rich and thick foam that results in smoother and cleaner shaves.  </li>
            <li>right? -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different types of shaving creams/gels and never really got a good shave out of them.</li>
            <li>3 bottles for the 10 bucks is a great price, just be ready to buy an after shave cream because it leave the skin really tight after the cream is remove.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it dries kind of fast on my head.  </li>
            <li>The pricing is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I had previously tried the Nivea Sensitive Skin shaving gel and loved it rich body.</li>
            <li>A can will last more than a month.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first can of this Nivea Q10 Energy Shaving Gel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it makes me look younger or if its the best etc.</li>
            <li>Does it do a better job than regular Gilette?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea shaving gel for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the CoQ10 one -</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT - this is like using shaving cream and a blade, only with a plug - and it&#x27;s sure a lot messier than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>This product totally turned me into a Nivea for Men fanboy - I use so many of their products I should buy stock, if it existed.</li>
            <li>Leaves a minimal cooling sensation which is nice as well</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried Nivea breaking off from Gillette.</li>
            <li>My journey of shaving gels started many years ago with Edge and later Gillette gels.  </li>
            <li>But at least the luggage smells very nice now.</li>
            <li>This gel is not as rich but does the job as well as the Sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave, don&#x27;t have to wait as long for some of the others before it has softened up the face hair enough to shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the old kind.</li>
            <li>Since I have thick hair, some spots I have to go over with the razor more than once and most gels/foams need reapplication, but this one doesn&#x27;t and leaves no razor burns or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not to be less than manly, but I love the q10 products get them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought it was the nicest, most comfortable shave of the various big brands.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so much better than the cheap stuff I used in the past.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream has a great smell and it produces a slightly thicker lather than the Gillette gel that i had used prior.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin super soft, and I get a really close shave with my Profusion Power razor.</li>
            <li>especially the 2 in 1 balm, you can use it on your whole face as lotion which is great in the winter when guys need to use lotion but don&#x27;t because putting on lotion is less than manly and it takes another step.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very dry skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Best of all, because it only takes a little, the cans last forever.  </li>
            <li>Great shaving gel, works well with a few different razors that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The fragrance stands out as well; it is very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>About time I get pampered with some real shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I always use a Norelco, and the Energy shaving gel seems to provide a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>He has very senstive skin</li>
            <li>A triple pack lasts me a whole year.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real plus.</li>
            <li>Hubby really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>I like so much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>This shave gel lathers really well</li>
            <li>so you need very little.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>the razor glides very well.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely feel the difference between this and really cheap shaving cream...</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but  just seems to make the blade float over the whiskers for me, but son lives it and wants to reorder</li>
            <li>This works very well and somehow manages to prevent any razor burn at all.</li>
            <li>Very close, smoothe saves too..</li>
            <li>and I am quite surprised that the right shaving gel makes a large difference.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shaving gel, with the Nivea Sensitive Skin as a close second.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream does not irritate my skin, and provides a smother shave than most other types I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>He says it is great, wakes you up, gives immediate energy to your face and morning focus, just not good to eat!</li>
            <li>I have to shave every day to maintain a clean look, but I&#x27;m unlucky in that I don&#x27;t grow enough facial hair to make it a comfortable shaving experience if I shave after only 24 hours with a few other shaving gels (waiting two days is best for me).</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast, so that was a big plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use less of it than other gels, and it&#x27;s more concentrated and richer in moisturizers than what I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced, which is a plus, and it rinses easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>After using it ( with a full grown beard, scruff and a next day shave )</li>
            <li>Over the years both of those products seem to have become more watered down and</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s what I am sure of: this Nivea gel softens a tough beard and lets the razor move closely and smoothly over your face.</li>
            <li>I lost more than half of the gel in the can.</li>
            <li>Its mild scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, and afterwards my shave feels as close as it ever has with my regular gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it is similar to the sensitive version just not as comfortable...</li>
            <li>My main problem with it is the sent it is for people who shave in the morning</li>
            <li>Really high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend these to anyone and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of steam and wetness so that it does not dry out.  </li>
            <li>These are a great deal, the 3 pack will last me about half a year with daily shaves.</li>
            <li>this gel covers thicker and more of your face with just a little bit of cream.</li>
            <li>Even if I let it grow a few more days, it always felt like I was shaving with a rusty lawnmower</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost in my opion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m sold on this new line and highly recommend trying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Occasionally, there might be some gel left, but it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, and this gel works remarkably.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using shaving cream to begin with, but when I saw this new line in the Nivea for Men shaving care products I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Glacial\\&quot; defines my pace of change when it comes to trying new shaving products.</li>
            <li>The three pack will probably last me years, but at least it was a good price.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of the Nivea shaving gels and my main go to gel is the sensitive version of this I saw this on sale and decided to pick it up.....</li>
            <li>It produces foam, so it&#x27;s not much different from Gillette&#x27;s foaming gel, but very different from the original gel conditioner for the Norelco CoolSkin system.     </li>
            <li>More expensive than others--but WORTH it!</li>
            <li>With the same blades, a significant difference between the Nivea Q10 and the Nivea shaving cream (regular)</li>
            <li>I have tried other gel shaving creams, such as those made by  Gillette and Schick, in an attempt to find one that worked better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, give this a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than other mainstream brands I&#x27;ve used such as Gillette and Edge.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no better shave cream for my face, but my face is so dang sensitive that I have to apply face cream after shaving so my face doesn&#x27;t turn into something more closely resembling a dandruff-laden face than one that is presentable.  </li>
            <li>I am the lucky recipient of facial hair that is as hard to shave as steel wire, but doesn&#x27;t grow in enough to have a respectable beard.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought a single bottle of these at my local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Much smoother that American products.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the sensitive skin one, it is not.</li>
            <li>Believe me at 67 years old I&#x27;ve used a lot of combinations of razors &amp; shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this Nivea product and have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>you want a more delicate scent, I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Bought for my 17 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>My face looks soft and uniformly shaven all the time.</li>
            <li>this is is a pump action one though.</li>
            <li>Recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and wow what a shave.</li>
            <li>(So far)</li>
            <li>I have been using from the same can for over 5 weeks and probably still have enough left in the can for several more weeks.</li>
            <li>just a small dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Product also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>One bottle has lasted several months of daily shaving, and the lather is nice and firm.</li>
            <li>I was tired with Gillette and thus wanted to try out a different brand and found this to be good.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shaving cream since it is thick and leaves my skin revitalized.  </li>
            <li>The shaving gel might be quite nice but the can is poorly constructed.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea shaving cream, this shaving cream feels thick in my hand.</li>
            <li>Other companies charge more for their creams and gels and they aren&#x27;t half as good or last half as long.</li>
            <li>I currently use a Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor, which was in need of a new razor blade; however, when I used it with Nivea, the old blade worked as if it were new.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Not as thick as the other name brands, but works as good.</li>
            <li>A little too thick to apply and dries out too quickly before I am able to shave.</li>
            <li>I just replaced an older Norelco with an AT 810 with the intent of using the Nivea Gel with it - big mistake.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about CoQ10 giving more &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve shaved my head every other day for 10 + years straight</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, the gentleman who uses this commented that you only need to pump a little becuase it foams up really big like magic</li>
            <li>gel seems like any other gel to me, but it matches all my other Nivea products, and is the reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my entire face, it has no odor and it allows me to cleanly shave without problems.</li>
            <li>I had been using Gillete&#x27;s gel and even regular shaving cream, but my face was so sensitive that it would break out after shaving.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a regular old shaving gel,</li>
            <li>i still have some of my old stuff left.  </li>
            <li>This gel is smooth and thick......</li>
            <li>It leaves your face smelling fresh for hours, without the heavy after-shave smell.</li>
            <li>Top plastic lid cover was broken in two bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Even if you&#x27;re slow to adopt (or even consider) new grooming products, this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li>This gel is imported from Germany, which may explain the higher cost compared to other domestic shaving gels.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels exactly the same after shaving with this as with any other shaving</li>
            <li>was a little priced, but price is more than offset by how far a small amount of the Nivea gel goes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce as much foam as some other brands, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to diminish the shave that it helps result in.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this product is that the can is over pressurized and tends to release more than needed for a single use.</li>
            <li>My only real complaint is that it smells kind of strange and the scent lasts.</li>

            <li> Of course, for the price, this is a great deal and will do if you are on a budget.</li>

            <li> great product ,great price ,you will love the shave you get .&lt;br /&gt;Stephen</li>
            <li> some not so good</li>
            <li> My husband loved using it.</li>
            <li> I would not call it supreme but is good.</li>
            <li> This is good shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about this gel and wanted to give it a try because all I&#x27;ve been using was the cheapest off the counter shaving gels I could find at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the pack of 3 is good for 9 months and with that price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> That was a good decision.</li>
            <li> it gives a really good shave and</li>
            <li> It uses aluminum for bottling, which is good.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Also, a pack of 3 for so cheap is a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a joke, but it is a good shave gel.</li>
            <li> but it is good</li>
            <li> and I get a good shave from it.</li>
            <li> , i bought them based on their cheaper price, in reality you can find cheaper at CVS but the product is good</li>
            <li> good smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price was good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, i use Barbasol for that&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Loved the bottles also.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave gel, I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nivea and they have not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best shaving cream on the general market and great scent!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who wants a great shave and an awesome scent to go along with it.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Nivea for Men Q 10.  </li>
            <li> and he is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it was amazing experience.</li>
            <li> Nice gel, good hydration.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good shave that doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical fragrance, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Easy, breasy, beautiful cover girl.</li>
            <li> Great lather, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice shaving gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li> It also gives me a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Nice dispenser too</li>
            <li> Decided to treat myself to some nice shave gel.</li>
            <li> Smells good without being too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Nivea Q10 does a nice moistening job so my skin can wait for a while after I get out of the shower and shave; used to be that I had to run to the face cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know to be honest.</li>
            <li> The gel in this kind is softer and drippier; it&#x27;s got an almost...snotty consistency.</li>
            <li> Couple this with a nice razor</li>
            <li> and it mixes into a nice thickness.</li>
            <li> it is nice on skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for a smooth clean shave and no irretation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, smells good, works really well and is the best shaving cream he has ever used.</li>
            <li> The gel spreads very easily and provides a slippery surface to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> I cut very easily and this limits those to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fine after using so good buy.</li>
            <li> The gel is economical, provides excellent lather, and has a clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By far the best shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 10 years and this is by far the best shaving gel I&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, smells good and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> smells nice and smells stays for a while love it</li>
            <li> Its kind of a lemony refreshing smell that wakes you up but for me I use cologne and I like to smell the cologne I am wearing and with this until the smell fades it</li>
            <li> Excellent Gel and gives pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very light fresh, clean scent, and provides excellent moisture.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it amazing, but after the 5-6 different brands of shaving creams/gels I&#x27;ve found this the best.</li>
            <li> All of this amounts to a very comfortable and relaxed shave that softened my beard and made shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> so you need to use more product than you should</li>
            <li> I needed a boost to try to get a better shave.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Gillette Fusion shave gel.  </li>
            <li> And if you give it 2 or 3 minutes to soak in it really works great.</li>
            <li> I get an incredibly close shave, the price is reasonable, and my face feels much more comfortable for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I will be ording more</li>
            <li> so I am using more of this than more people would use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is  okay.  </li>
            <li> Interesting marketing.</li>
            <li> This is better than Edge.</li>
            <li> This is a GEL not a cream, which is much better in my view.</li>
            <li> This seems to have alleviated this problem and my skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say this is my favorite of all shaving gels I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> What more do they want you to say?  </li>
            <li> Better than going to the store</li>
            <li> Shaving against the grain is easier because it seems to have either more or better lubricants.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make shaving any more luxurious --</li>
            <li> Definitely the best shaving cream/gel on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s shaving foam, and this product is definitely better.  </li>
            <li> more for my dad as well.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> Seriously glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> and though I doubt the claims of &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; haha, it really is a great shaving lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They claim there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one though, since, when I bought it, it was a better deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Well, OK, that might be overstating it a bit...</li>
            <li> more tissue squares populating your face.</li>
            <li> it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting the outstanding performance of this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> On reaching home I discovered that the nozzle part at the top had come off even though the cap was still on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary razor for years - and been pleased.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every shaving cream/gel but have tried many.</li>
            <li> I will not be able to smell it ...</li>
            <li> It smells nice and leaves my skin very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> but this stuff certainly makes it a significantly more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I was reading about this on r/wicked_edge and it was highly rated and a great price.  </li>
            <li> pretty good product</li>
            <li> The price from amazing is great, and I know that I only have to buy maybe 2 times a year.</li>
            <li> Nice mild Fragrance.</li>
            <li> The gel tends to cluster up and does not have a refreshing or clean feel to it - I would recommend spending more for quality and looking at Proraso shave creams.</li>
            <li> The shave is smoother and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]] which works great.</li>
            <li> It makes my shaving experience alot more comfortable and it feels like it revives my skin in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not take much lotion for a good shave.</li>
            <li> The gel is not scented and very slippery, allowing for a good shave.</li>
            <li> Has nice smell and does the job, I get all the women now, the power of this product is quite enlightening</li>
            <li> Works really well, and it seems to be a good deal for the cost.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, this, and a real close</li>
            <li> best part was after every use it didn&#x27;t continue to drop or foam at the spray nozzle, an annoyance experienced quite frequently with other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li> use it too shave in the morning for a easy, and awaking shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are not a fan of strong smelling product then this would not be for you.</li>
            <li> For this price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004E3ION4 Bic Comfort 3 Advance Disposable Razor for Men,  4-Count]]I have used high quality razors all my life some were good</li>
            <li> but honestly, the reviews about it are not wrong</li>
            <li> Kind of funny that every time I visit Walmart and look for Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles, there are always out.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel is fine.  </li>
            <li> and I get full coverage with great protection during the shave, even with old beat up blades.  </li>
            <li> My husband said that the product itself is just fine, but he does not like the smell</li>
            <li> If you like a musk odor or use musky cologne, this gel should be fine, but for me, it was off-</li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase more when finished with this first pack.</li>
            <li> , so some people might also agree this is a fine shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but works fine.</li>
            <li> This one did it and leaves my face so smooth.  </li>
            <li> triple blade smooth no pull .</li>
            <li> and I did need a gel that provides a closer but comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It may sound petty, but the stuff is a pain to get out of the can.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave -</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the way the can looks sitting on my counter.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap 99 cent can of Barbasol</li>
            <li> It leaves his skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels substantial and I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> it is a fresh scent and you will be able to smell it for atleast a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> Foamy and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> The lather is fantastic and smooth and a can lasts me a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> So amazing price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> softens the hair, and makes shaving easy and quick.</li>
            <li> it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, either, but it works just fine, and it&#x27;s definitely superior to some of the other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Shaves clean.</li>
            <li> Lats forever, helps you get a close clean shave, and with the price on the three pack, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different gels and this is, by far, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Nivea does have a slight pleasant smell to it and the moisturizer built in is probably better for your skin than cheap foam.  </li>
            <li> Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this like so many other good things I find.</li>
            <li> Cool and clean smell.</li>
            <li> When I bought this gel I was trying to cut costs on replacing gel for my Norelco Cool Skin Razor with gel conditioner dispenser ([[ASIN:B000UJZIEY Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System]])     </li>
            <li> I love this gel thanks.</li>
            <li> I like it better but can&#x27;t really provide a tangible reason as to why....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked this gel so far.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when I figured that out, because I love the smell of the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel overall is good, I use it to shave my head</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> and like it a lot better than the Energy shaving gel because it has more natural ingredients, is (IMO) better for my skin, and goes on clear so you can see what you are shaving.  </li>
            <li> For the same amount dispensed on both products, Nivea foams quite a bit more, and the foam seems to be more dense compared to Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin being more energized than normal??  </li>
            <li> To me this is the best out there, that I have tried at least!</li>
            <li> Honestly, gone through a lot of different shaving products, and this helps tremendously with razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a great shave with little irritation using this gel along with Dorco Pace 3 razor and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not to try something besides the cheapest available shaving cream, absolutely try this.</li>
            <li> GEL IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING WISH</li>
            <li> A very think gel thank keeps your face smooth and hydrated as you shave.</li>
            <li> really well keeping my skin intact and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly, I was able to shave using my shaving system.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, isn&#x27;t harsh, and is easily to shave and clean with.</li>
            <li> A better deal could have been had directly from Dorco.</li>
            <li> I rarely nick my face when using this shaving cream</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> The powerful, musky scent was intolerable to me and my wife.</li>
            <li> The cheap stuff actually gave me a better closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The can says something about supplying one&#x27;s skin with &amp;#34;new energy&amp;#34; or some such, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve noticed nothing of the kind.</li>
            <li> I felt made a good compromise between close shave, and minimal &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pressing on the top gives you a pump action to push the gel out.</li>
            <li> Great product - produces a rich and thick foam that results in smoother and cleaner shaves.  </li>
            <li> right? -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of shaving creams/gels and never really got a good shave out of them.</li>
            <li> 3 bottles for the 10 bucks is a great price, just be ready to buy an after shave cream because it leave the skin really tight after the cream is remove.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it dries kind of fast on my head.  </li>
            <li> The pricing is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Nivea Sensitive Skin shaving gel and loved it rich body.</li>
            <li> A can will last more than a month.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first can of this Nivea Q10 Energy Shaving Gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes me look younger or if its the best etc.</li>
            <li> Does it do a better job than regular Gilette?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea shaving gel for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the CoQ10 one -</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT - this is like using shaving cream and a blade, only with a plug - and it&#x27;s sure a lot messier than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> This product totally turned me into a Nivea for Men fanboy - I use so many of their products I should buy stock, if it existed.</li>
            <li> Leaves a minimal cooling sensation which is nice as well</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Nivea breaking off from Gillette.</li>
            <li> My journey of shaving gels started many years ago with Edge and later Gillette gels.  </li>
            <li> But at least the luggage smells very nice now.</li>
            <li> This gel is not as rich but does the job as well as the Sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave, don&#x27;t have to wait as long for some of the others before it has softened up the face hair enough to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the old kind.</li>
            <li> Since I have thick hair, some spots I have to go over with the razor more than once and most gels/foams need reapplication, but this one doesn&#x27;t and leaves no razor burns or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not to be less than manly, but I love the q10 products get them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought it was the nicest, most comfortable shave of the various big brands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so much better than the cheap stuff I used in the past.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has a great smell and it produces a slightly thicker lather than the Gillette gel that i had used prior.  </li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin super soft, and I get a really close shave with my Profusion Power razor.</li>
            <li> especially the 2 in 1 balm, you can use it on your whole face as lotion which is great in the winter when guys need to use lotion but don&#x27;t because putting on lotion is less than manly and it takes another step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Best of all, because it only takes a little, the cans last forever.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving gel, works well with a few different razors that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The fragrance stands out as well; it is very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About time I get pampered with some real shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I always use a Norelco, and the Energy shaving gel seems to provide a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> He has very senstive skin</li>
            <li> A triple pack lasts me a whole year.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a real plus.</li>
            <li> Hubby really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> I like so much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> This shave gel lathers really well</li>
            <li> so you need very little.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> the razor glides very well.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely feel the difference between this and really cheap shaving cream...</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but  just seems to make the blade float over the whiskers for me, but son lives it and wants to reorder</li>
            <li> This works very well and somehow manages to prevent any razor burn at all.</li>
            <li> Very close, smoothe saves too..</li>
            <li> and I am quite surprised that the right shaving gel makes a large difference.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shaving gel, with the Nivea Sensitive Skin as a close second.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream does not irritate my skin, and provides a smother shave than most other types I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> He says it is great, wakes you up, gives immediate energy to your face and morning focus, just not good to eat!</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day to maintain a clean look, but I&#x27;m unlucky in that I don&#x27;t grow enough facial hair to make it a comfortable shaving experience if I shave after only 24 hours with a few other shaving gels (waiting two days is best for me).</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast, so that was a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use less of it than other gels, and it&#x27;s more concentrated and richer in moisturizers than what I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced, which is a plus, and it rinses easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> After using it ( with a full grown beard, scruff and a next day shave )</li>
            <li> Over the years both of those products seem to have become more watered down and</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s what I am sure of: this Nivea gel softens a tough beard and lets the razor move closely and smoothly over your face.</li>
            <li> I lost more than half of the gel in the can.</li>
            <li> Its mild scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, and afterwards my shave feels as close as it ever has with my regular gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it is similar to the sensitive version just not as comfortable...</li>
            <li> My main problem with it is the sent it is for people who shave in the morning</li>
            <li> Really high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend these to anyone and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of steam and wetness so that it does not dry out.  </li>
            <li> These are a great deal, the 3 pack will last me about half a year with daily shaves.</li>
            <li> this gel covers thicker and more of your face with just a little bit of cream.</li>
            <li> Even if I let it grow a few more days, it always felt like I was shaving with a rusty lawnmower</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost in my opion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m sold on this new line and highly recommend trying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Occasionally, there might be some gel left, but it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, and this gel works remarkably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using shaving cream to begin with, but when I saw this new line in the Nivea for Men shaving care products I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Glacial\\&quot; defines my pace of change when it comes to trying new shaving products.</li>
            <li> The three pack will probably last me years, but at least it was a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of the Nivea shaving gels and my main go to gel is the sensitive version of this I saw this on sale and decided to pick it up.....</li>
            <li> It produces foam, so it&#x27;s not much different from Gillette&#x27;s foaming gel, but very different from the original gel conditioner for the Norelco CoolSkin system.     </li>
            <li> More expensive than others--but WORTH it!</li>
            <li> With the same blades, a significant difference between the Nivea Q10 and the Nivea shaving cream (regular)</li>
            <li> I have tried other gel shaving creams, such as those made by  Gillette and Schick, in an attempt to find one that worked better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, give this a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than other mainstream brands I&#x27;ve used such as Gillette and Edge.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better shave cream for my face, but my face is so dang sensitive that I have to apply face cream after shaving so my face doesn&#x27;t turn into something more closely resembling a dandruff-laden face than one that is presentable.  </li>
            <li> I am the lucky recipient of facial hair that is as hard to shave as steel wire, but doesn&#x27;t grow in enough to have a respectable beard.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a single bottle of these at my local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Much smoother that American products.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the sensitive skin one, it is not.</li>
            <li> Believe me at 67 years old I&#x27;ve used a lot of combinations of razors &amp; shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this Nivea product and have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> you want a more delicate scent, I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Bought for my 17 year old grandson.</li>
            <li> My face looks soft and uniformly shaven all the time.</li>
            <li> this is is a pump action one though.</li>
            <li> Recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and wow what a shave.</li>
            <li> (So far)</li>
            <li> I have been using from the same can for over 5 weeks and probably still have enough left in the can for several more weeks.</li>
            <li> just a small dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Product also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted several months of daily shaving, and the lather is nice and firm.</li>
            <li> I was tired with Gillette and thus wanted to try out a different brand and found this to be good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shaving cream since it is thick and leaves my skin revitalized.  </li>
            <li> The shaving gel might be quite nice but the can is poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea shaving cream, this shaving cream feels thick in my hand.</li>
            <li> Other companies charge more for their creams and gels and they aren&#x27;t half as good or last half as long.</li>
            <li> I currently use a Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor, which was in need of a new razor blade; however, when I used it with Nivea, the old blade worked as if it were new.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as the other name brands, but works as good.</li>
            <li> A little too thick to apply and dries out too quickly before I am able to shave.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an older Norelco with an AT 810 with the intent of using the Nivea Gel with it - big mistake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about CoQ10 giving more &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve shaved my head every other day for 10 + years straight</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the gentleman who uses this commented that you only need to pump a little becuase it foams up really big like magic</li>
            <li> gel seems like any other gel to me, but it matches all my other Nivea products, and is the reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my entire face, it has no odor and it allows me to cleanly shave without problems.</li>
            <li> I had been using Gillete&#x27;s gel and even regular shaving cream, but my face was so sensitive that it would break out after shaving.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it&#x27;s not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a regular old shaving gel,</li>
            <li> i still have some of my old stuff left.  </li>
            <li> This gel is smooth and thick......</li>
            <li> It leaves your face smelling fresh for hours, without the heavy after-shave smell.</li>
            <li> Top plastic lid cover was broken in two bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re slow to adopt (or even consider) new grooming products, this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li> This gel is imported from Germany, which may explain the higher cost compared to other domestic shaving gels.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels exactly the same after shaving with this as with any other shaving</li>
            <li> was a little priced, but price is more than offset by how far a small amount of the Nivea gel goes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce as much foam as some other brands, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to diminish the shave that it helps result in.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that the can is over pressurized and tends to release more than needed for a single use.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it smells kind of strange and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly long lasting.</li>
            <li> last so long before</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t emphasize how long they seem to last.</li>
            <li> well, since Edge was introduced long ago in the 20th century:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t feel a sudden blast of energy while using the gel, I did need a gel that didn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
            <li> I usually buy whatever gel looks cheapest and is decent in the store.</li>
            <li> No need to go crazy looking for something exotic.  </li>
            <li> usually I get the sensitive skin gel that comes in the white can.</li>
            <li> I have used and counted on Edge for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> 3 bottles goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just prep your beard with a hand towel and hot water, then apply cream, taking time to cover areas deeply, adding a bit of water to thin, and shave with the grain, and you will get the smoothest face you&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> i usually just purchase plain shaving cream but this gel is actually worth it.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used shaving soap, but it dried my skin too much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a blade very often due to irritation and excessive blood donation when i do so.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use less of the Nivea to get the same results as I did with Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re not satisfied with your current shaving gel, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> (oh, and a 3 pack of this will last a very long time since it takes so little).</li>
            <li> It does, the can is made differently, but I also get a closer shave and need even less product than with Edge, neither of which I expected.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little to cover</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy, so it take me months to use up a can of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> but not as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I used to get pretty bad irratation on my neck from shaving and this stuff has almost completely knock that out.</li>
            <li> FYI a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Been useing gillette foamy in the past and will not go back.  </li>
            <li> Only need a small amount and like the closeness that I get with my Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li> After using other shaving gels for years, I decided to give Nivea a try.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day.  </li>
            <li> It was noticeably thicker than any of the other gel shaving creams when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Does not leak through the nozzle as much as other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what either the Q10 or the \\&quot;double</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll throw the other stuff away</li>
            <li> In a pinch I use it at the sink, but found it dry&#x27;s out a little</li>
            <li> Anyway, just a little bit of this stuff expands up into a thick foam and completely covers my face.</li>
            <li> dispenser button is hard to manipulate, especially with wet hands.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long ways!  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of Nivea to cover your face, much less than any of the other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, really, but I think when I&#x27;m out</li>
            <li> It is almost like there is not enough pressure in the can to propel the thick gel.  </li>
            <li> the entire face and shaving is much smoother, less painful, and closer.  </li>
            <li> I have always used the typical shaving lather but decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Barbosol shaving cream for years because it worked and was less than $1.00 per can</li>
            <li> but it is less viscous than the gel I&#x27;m used to.)</li>
            <li> This shaving cream did the job, but i just thought it smelled odd</li>
            <li> Leaves less mess after using.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya.....</li>
            <li> I have a mustache and a little beard on my chin.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and if I don&#x27;t shave on weekends&lt;br /&gt;Come</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette&#x27;s dispenser is also a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream is not smooth as Schick or gillette.</li>
            <li> The smell is also ok)&lt;br /&gt;It beat other products by the price, at least this time for me).</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong at all</li>
            <li> Anyone who is expecting double action from this stupid can of foam needs to get their head examined.</li>
            <li> so good,,,,,,,It takes very little to shave my face,,,,,,It</li>
            <li> placed a reorder immediately fearful that they may not be available .</li>
            <li> with that small gripe, I will buy again when these 3 cans run out.</li>
            <li> the past, even with shaving gel, I would cut myself every now and then with my razor.</li>
            <li> Lathers up a lot for a small squeeze -</li>
            <li> With my past Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used a pre shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser was extremely hard to use on my bottle.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Or at least one of them had a manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> At least 3 times I looked and they are all gone</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not has thick</li>
            <li> Monday morning my beard is rather thick .</li>
            <li> While other products often cause his skin to breakout if shaving everyday, this did not do it AS bad.</li>
            <li> However, the shaving comfort is not remarkable with this gel.  </li>
            <li> B001E5E240 Gillette Fusion Tough Beard Shave Gel 7 Oz</li>
            <li> But the gel itself is so watery that the foam is thin and won&#x27;t stay on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was always difficult to get a close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite the fan of this stuff, though I will say the caps have a disturbing tendency to get lost.</li>
            <li> I was using Edge Gel but eventually the bottom of the can would fail and the gel would foam out.  </li>
            <li> I use Gillette fusion pro-glide (4 blades) and have always had a problem with getting ingrown hairs (looks like acne) around my jawline because of what a weird angle it is to shave at.</li>
            <li> ..dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I shave using cold water before I shower and don&#x27;t apply soap underneath the gel.</li>
            <li> The can was badly damaged and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Before the Nivea gel, it was always a painful process.  </li>
            <li> he used twice and stop using it...:(</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping for some sort of miraculous glow from the CoQ10, though, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed -</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as expected and the price was right. No need to go crazy looking for something exotic.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I&#x27;ve always thought it was the nicest, most comfortable shave of the various big brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best shaving cream on the general market and great scent!! I stopped buying gillette shaving cream it&#x27;s not has thick so you need to use more product than you should</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3 pack of this but they sent only one can of the Nivea shaving gel. The can was badly damaged and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> not to be less than manly, but I love the q10 products get them! it is worth it! especially the 2 in 1 balm, you can use it on your whole face as lotion which is great in the winter when guys need to use lotion but don&#x27;t because putting on lotion is less than manly and it takes another step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using shaving cream to begin with, but when I saw this new line in the Nivea for Men shaving care products I thought I would give it a try. I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, and this gel works remarkably. Taking a look at the ingredients: there is no alcohol, there IS glycerin, mineral oil, and, of course, Coenzyme q10. All of this amounts to a very comfortable and relaxed shave that softened my beard and made shaving a breeze. The fragrance stands out as well; it is very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m sold on this new line and highly recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a great shave cream or gel to use with my ES8249 Panasonic.  I needed a boost to try to get a better shave. This one did it and leaves my face so smooth.  I just could not believe it. Great smell that lingers on for a while.  Been useing gillette foamy in the past and will not go back.  Use it in the shower after washing and with my anti fog mirror.  Just the right amount of steam and wetness so that it does not dry out.  In a pinch I use it at the sink, but found it dry&#x27;s out a little so I rather use in the shower.  Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this like so many other good things I find.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Gillette Fusion shave gel.  I feel like I have to use less of the Nivea to get the same results as I did with Gillette.  And if you give it 2 or 3 minutes to soak in it really works great.</li>
            <li> Easy, breasy, beautiful cover girl.</li>
            <li> About time I get pampered with some real shaving gel.</li>
            <li> As a guy who had only used the gillette shaving cream or the 1 dollar cvs bottles of shaving cream, I decided to try this based on the reviews online. It was always difficult to get a close shave no matter what I did and then I would end up with razor burn. In all seriousness, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought from amazon. I get an incredibly close shave, the price is reasonable, and my face feels much more comfortable for the rest of the day. If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not to try something besides the cheapest available shaving cream, absolutely try this. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya.....this gel covers thicker and more of your face with just a little bit of cream. Much smoother that American products. Leaves your face like you just used some moisturizer on it. Shaves clean. Once you use this you won&#x27;t use Fusion or Gillette gels any longer...</li>
            <li> OMG IM 61 AND HAD THE BEST SHAVE OF MY LIFE THIS MORNING THIS SHAVE GEL IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING WISH I KNEW ABOUT IT SOONER</li>
            <li> Quality product for shaving. One of the best.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004E3ION4 Bic Comfort 3 Advance Disposable Razor for Men,  4-Count]]I have used high quality razors all my life some were good some not so good but this razor is the best . triple blade smooth no pull . I have a heavy beard and if I don&#x27;t shave on weekends&lt;br /&gt;Come Monday morning my beard is rather thick . this razor combined with nivea gel shaving creame gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve been shaving for 45 years .&lt;br /&gt;I placed a reorder immediately fearful that they may not be available . great product ,great price ,you will love the shave you get .&lt;br /&gt;Stephen</li>
            <li> My husband loved using it. While other products often cause his skin to breakout if shaving everyday, this did not do it AS bad. I will be ording more</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaving gel. I would not call it supreme but is good. I was tired with Gillette and thus wanted to try out a different brand and found this to be good.</li>
            <li> I bought three for my bf...he used twice and stop using it...:(</li>
            <li> I was reading about this on r/wicked_edge and it was highly rated and a great price.  I bought a 3 pack in the middle of May and here it is August 1st and I still feel like I can get another month out of it based on the weight of the canister.  Oh, did I mention I don&#x27;t just shave my face?  I have a bald head too so I am using more of this than more people would use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells nice.  My only gripe is that it dries kind of fast on my head.  That may be because I have a big head and it takes a while to shave it all, but regardless, I have to sprinkle water on my head with my finger tips to re-wet it when I get to that area to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that small gripe, I will buy again when these 3 cans run out.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly long lasting. I&#x27;m quite the fan of this stuff, though I will say the caps have a disturbing tendency to get lost. They&#x27;re larger than you&#x27;d think, so don&#x27;t use these for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy, so it take me months to use up a can of shaving cream.  I was using Edge Gel but eventually the bottom of the can would fail and the gel would foam out.  I got this in hopes it would fix the problem.  It does, the can is made differently, but I also get a closer shave and need even less product than with Edge, neither of which I expected.  The three pack will probably last me years, but at least it was a good price.</li>
            <li> This cream has parabens. I thought things made in Germany do not have it. These chemicals cause cancer. I do not recommend it. I will call the company.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has a great smell and it produces a slightly thicker lather than the Gillette gel that i had used prior.  The smell is  okay.  But why do they advertise that this product will provide your skin with energy??  I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin being more energized than normal??  Interesting marketing.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day to maintain a clean look, but I&#x27;m unlucky in that I don&#x27;t grow enough facial hair to make it a comfortable shaving experience if I shave after only 24 hours with a few other shaving gels (waiting two days is best for me). I originally bought a single bottle of these at my local Wal-Mart. This gel is imported from Germany, which may explain the higher cost compared to other domestic shaving gels. Overall, if you&#x27;re not satisfied with your current shaving gel, give this one a try. Nivea makes quality products in my experience.</li>
            <li> When I bought this gel I was trying to cut costs on replacing gel for my Norelco Cool Skin Razor with gel conditioner dispenser ([[ASIN:B000UJZIEY Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System]])     This shaving gel is NOT the same thing as this [[ASIN:B002GJTYDW Philips Norelco HS803/14 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner and Replacement Cartridge (Pack of 3)]] or this [[ASIN:B001E96V0O Philips Norelco HS800 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner (Pack of 3)]].     It produces foam, so it&#x27;s not much different from Gillette&#x27;s foaming gel, but very different from the original gel conditioner for the Norelco CoolSkin system.     Unexpectedly, I was able to shave using my shaving system.  (I don&#x27;t know if this will reduce the life of my razor blades, though).</li>
            <li> Nivea Energy Shaving Gel, Q10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser button is hard to manipulate, especially with wet hands. The gel spreads very easily and provides a slippery surface to prevent razor burn. I always use a Norelco, and the Energy shaving gel seems to provide a much closer shave. The Energy gel smells great, and the label indicates it contains Taurine and Q10 to energize the skin. While I didn&#x27;t feel a sudden blast of energy while using the gel, I did need a gel that didn&#x27;t dry out my face and I did need a gel that provides a closer but comfortable shave. The Nivea Energy gel did the trick. I had been using Gillete&#x27;s gel and even regular shaving cream, but my face was so sensitive that it would break out after shaving. I didn&#x27;t notice any of these symptoms with the Energy shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5 out of 5 stars, lets me get a closer shave using a Norelco without any irritation. The dispenser was extremely hard to use on my bottle.</li>
            <li> By far the best shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent skin lubrication---considerably better than the air-fluff foam shave lotions. More expensive than others--but WORTH it!</li>
            <li> So happy to find this. It is the only thing my husband likes to use and none of our local stores carry it now.</li>
            <li> A very think gel thank keeps your face smooth and hydrated as you shave. This is better than Edge. The smell is not strong at all I love this gel thanks.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the sensitive skin one, it is not. Amazon does not allow returns on products in aerosol cans.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount and like the closeness that I get with my Proglide Power.  Cool and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent Gel and gives pretty smooth shave. Forms a lot of lather with just pea size gel. Nice mild Fragrance. Gives close shave with my Gillete Mach3 Razor. Before this I used Gillete Shave Gel, and compared to it, I would prefer this.</li>
            <li> I use the Panasonic ES-LV61 Electric Razor Arc MUltiflex Pivoting Head in the shower &amp; the two paired together give me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Believe me at 67 years old I&#x27;ve used a lot of combinations of razors &amp; shaving cream.</li>
            <li> He has very senstive skin and this is the only product he will use. He has tried others, but comes back to this.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!! It&#x27;s smooth, smells good, works really well and is the best shaving cream he has ever used. Buy this for yourself, or for your man!</li>
            <li> Good quality shaving gel and an excellent price.  Not as thick as the other name brands, but works as good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette products for years, and switched Nivea shave cream. It is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get some irritation in my ears with Gillette and have not had any issues with Nivea. It does not take much lotion for a good shave. A can will last more than a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a blade very often due to irritation and excessive blood donation when i do so. I thought I would try this and see if it would help. Works really well keeping my skin intact and smooth. Great lather, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Lats forever, helps you get a close clean shave, and with the price on the three pack, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is expecting double action from this stupid can of foam needs to get their head examined. I have bought literally hundreds of these things and haven&#x27;t even gotten laid once. What a crock. Next.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it amazing, but after the 5-6 different brands of shaving creams/gels I&#x27;ve found this the best. This is a GEL not a cream, which is much better in my view. I use Gillette fusion pro-glide (4 blades) and have always had a problem with getting ingrown hairs (looks like acne) around my jawline because of what a weird angle it is to shave at. This seems to have alleviated this problem and my skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am the lucky recipient of facial hair that is as hard to shave as steel wire, but doesn&#x27;t grow in enough to have a respectable beard.  So off it must go every day or two.  Before the Nivea gel, it was always a painful process.  Even if I let it grow a few more days, it always felt like I was shaving with a rusty lawnmower blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Nivea Shaving Gel.  This stuff is awesome!  It only takes a little to cover the entire face and shaving is much smoother, less painful, and closer.  Best of all, because it only takes a little, the cans last forever.  I purchased this 3-pack 7 months ago and I only recently broke open can #2.  And I shave all the time.  Other companies charge more for their creams and gels and they aren&#x27;t half as good or last half as long.</li>
            <li> I must say this is my favorite of all shaving gels I&#x27;ve ever used.  The smell is amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants a great shave and an awesome scent to go along with it.</li>
            <li> This is good shaving gel. It smells nice and leaves my skin very nice and soft. It also gives me a nice shave. It doesn&#x27;t produce as much foam as some other brands, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to diminish the shave that it helps result in.</li>
            <li> Great shaving gel, works well with a few different razors that I&#x27;ve used. Has a nice smell, isn&#x27;t harsh, and is easily to shave and clean with. This shaving gel is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> This gel is smooth and thick......just a small dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Product also has a nice smell.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> A triple pack lasts me a whole year. The gel is not scented and very slippery, allowing for a good shave. Nice dispenser too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dollar Shave Club shave butter and like it a lot better than the Energy shaving gel because it has more natural ingredients, is (IMO) better for my skin, and goes on clear so you can see what you are shaving.  Of course, for the price, this is a great deal and will do if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first can of this Nivea Q10 Energy Shaving Gel and I am quite surprised that the right shaving gel makes a large difference. I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about this gel and wanted to give it a try because all I&#x27;ve been using was the cheapest off the counter shaving gels I could find at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, even with shaving gel, I would cut myself every now and then with my razor. After using Nivea Q10, the only word that can describe my shaving experience is \\&quot;smooth.\\&quot; I only have to go through areas once and my face would be looking baby cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sounds like I&#x27;m advertising the shaving gel but honestly, the reviews about it are not wrong and I will be continuing to buy this shaving gel unless I&#x27;m convinced otherwise. 1 can can last me about 3 months so the pack of 3 is good for 9 months and with that price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I was buying this product from another store, then one day it occurred to me to buy it on Amazon. It&#x27;s a great price for a pack of 3. I shave my entire head every 2 days, Nivea feels luxurious and the shaving gel doesn&#x27;t slide off my face and head. That&#x27;s a real plus. It&#x27;s a great price for the pack of 3. It feels invigorating.</li>
            <li> Hubby really likes this product.  What more do they want you to say?  Will buy again.  &amp;#34;Good stuff&amp;#34; it is.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel is fine.  It may sound petty, but the stuff is a pain to get out of the can.  It is almost like there is not enough pressure in the can to propel the thick gel.  It is a pain.  Cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and spreads evenly with my brush.  One of the best shave gels I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Just like the package says..Better than going to the store</li>
            <li> I like so much I recommend 100%😀😀😀😀😀</li>
            <li> Received on time.  Makes shaving easy.  Good quality. Thanks</li>
            <li> This works very well.  Lathers up a lot for a small squeeze - I have been using only a nickel sized gel droplet on my hand before foaming it up and lathering up my face and I get full coverage with great protection during the shave, even with old beat up blades.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> After using other shaving gels for years, I decided to give Nivea a try. That was a good decision. I&#x27;m able to use less of it than other gels, and it&#x27;s more concentrated and richer in moisturizers than what I&#x27;ve been used to. Shaving against the grain is easier because it seems to have either more or better lubricants. It doesn&#x27;t make shaving any more luxurious -- c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s still shaving, and it&#x27;s a pain to have to do it every day - but this stuff certainly makes it a significantly more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shaving gel, with the Nivea Sensitive Skin as a close second. It leaves your face smelling fresh for hours, without the heavy after-shave smell. I use it with my Norelco SensoTouch 3D, and it works great with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 10 years and this is by far the best shaving gel I&#x27;ve encountered. Great price. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this Nivea product and have been pleasantly surprised. This shave gel lathers really well so you need very little.&lt;br /&gt;3 bottles will last me 2 years I bet. I have a mustache and a little beard on my chin. This Nivea product and a good blade will give your face the smoothness you desire with incredible ease.</li>
            <li> Has nice smell and does the job, I get all the women now, the power of this product is quite enlightening</li>
            <li> Excellent shave gel, I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nivea and they have not disappointed with this product. One bottle has lasted several months of daily shaving, and the lather is nice and firm. I especially like that it&#x27;s not heavily scented. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have always used the typical shaving lather but decided to try this.  it gives a really good shave and the razor glides very well.  it even helps prevent skin from drying out after a shave.</li>
            <li> Switched back to a blade shaver after using an electric for a couple of decades. Decided to treat myself to some nice shave gel. This stuff is so much better than the cheap stuff I used in the past. I shave using cold water before I shower and don&#x27;t apply soap underneath the gel. I&#x27;m getting a great shave with little irritation using this gel along with Dorco Pace 3 razor and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I made the mistake of assuming Amazon had the best price on my items. They didn&#x27;t. A better deal could have been had directly from Dorco. [...]</li>
            <li> I am not a shaving cream expert but I used it and it worked. Skin feels fine after using so good buy.</li>
            <li> Really high quality shaving cream. Gives a very smooth shave. With the same blades, a significant difference between the Nivea Q10 and the Nivea shaving cream (regular)</li>
            <li> Great product - produces a rich and thick foam that results in smoother and cleaner shaves.  Definitely the best shaving cream/gel on the market.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shaving cream since it is thick and leaves my skin revitalized.  I rarely nick my face when using this shaving cream</li>
            <li> 3 bottles for the 10 bucks is a great price, just be ready to buy an after shave cream because it leave the skin really tight after the cream is remove.</li>
            <li> These are a great deal, the 3 pack will last me about half a year with daily shaves. Also, as I shave in the shower, I appreciate that the cans do not rust.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day.  I have been using Gillette&#x27;s shaving foam, and this product is definitely better.  For the same amount dispensed on both products, Nivea foams quite a bit more, and the foam seems to be more dense compared to Gillette&#x27;s.  As I rub the foam across my scalp, I can feel my fingers glide smoother too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette&#x27;s dispenser is also a bit messy. After dispensing the gel, the bottle will continue to leak some gel.  If I do not wash off the gel, it dries up and sticks to the dispenser.  Nivea&#x27;s dispenser is resistant to leak.  Occasionally, there might be some gel left, but it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave - it&#x27;s a regular old shaving gel, right? - with the added &#x27;kick&#x27;, placebo effect or no, of caffeine. I also enjoy the way the can looks sitting on my counter.</li>
            <li> Honestly, gone through a lot of different shaving products, and this helps tremendously with razor burn. 3rd time buying the three pack.</li>
            <li> My husband said that the product itself is just fine, but he does not like the smell and you can smell it on you for three hours after. If you are not a fan of strong smelling product then this would not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have this as a subscribe and save item. Works great and will continue using it. FYI a little bit goes a long way. Very light fresh, clean scent, and provides excellent moisture.</li>
            <li> I have used and counted on Edge for as long as I can remember. I have tried other gel shaving creams, such as those made by  Gillette and Schick, in an attempt to find one that worked better. None performed as well as Edge. Finally, about a month ago, I purchased Nivea for Men Q10. It was noticeably thicker than any of the other gel shaving creams when I put it on my face. I currently use a Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor, which was in need of a new razor blade; however, when I used it with Nivea, the old blade worked as if it were new. I continue to use that \\&quot;old\\&quot; blade, and it still works well. You only need a small amount of Nivea to cover your face, much less than any of the other brands. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> This Nivea gel gets me incredibly close shaves.  It isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced, which is a plus, and it rinses easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  I prefer this to the Edge, Gilette, and Fusion gels I&#x27;ve tried.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good shave that doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical fragrance, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 4 months now (twice a week). Still not one down.&lt;br /&gt;Took more for my dad as well.&lt;br /&gt;High recommended</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the gentleman who uses this commented that you only need to pump a little becuase it foams up really big like magic and it smells very nice.</li>
            <li> To me this is the best out there, that I have tried at least! The price from amazing is great, and I know that I only have to buy maybe 2 times a year. It always leaves my skin super soft, and I get a really close shave with my Profusion Power razor.</li>
            <li> Seriously glad I purchased these. I usually buy whatever gel looks cheapest and is decent in the store. I&#x27;ve never had a can of gel last so long before and though I doubt the claims of &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; haha, it really is a great shaving lather.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend these to anyone and will continue to buy. Can&#x27;t emphasize how long they seem to last.</li>
            <li> I tried [[ASIN:B001E5E240 Gillette Fusion Tough Beard Shave Gel 7 Oz (Pack of 6)]], but it uses an iron bottle that rusts and leaves a brown ring on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]]. It uses aluminum for bottling, which is good. But the gel itself is so watery that the foam is thin and won&#x27;t stay on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is the best in the end.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Good quality.  Smells good without being too overwhelming.  Does not leak through the nozzle as much as other products.</li>
            <li> To me, shaving gel is shaving gel. I have never been picky and will use almost anything to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel seems like any other gel to me, but it matches all my other Nivea products, and is the reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my entire face, it has no odor and it allows me to cleanly shave without problems. I will probably stick with this shaving gel as it works for my needs. Also, a pack of 3 for so cheap is a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Barbosol shaving cream for years because it worked and was less than $1.00 per can but after using Nivea Q10 Gel I may never go back. The shave is smoother and more comfortable. Worth the extra cost in my opion.</li>
            <li> Nice gel, good hydration. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This gel works but not as I had expected.  A little too thick to apply and dries out too quickly before I am able to shave. Still works!</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best shaving gels I have used.  It works perfectly, smells good and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s a no brainer at this price.</li>
            <li> As advertized.  Works really well, and it seems to be a good deal for the cost.  I think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better shave cream for my face, but my face is so dang sensitive that I have to apply face cream after shaving so my face doesn&#x27;t turn into something more closely resembling a dandruff-laden face than one that is presentable.  Nivea Q10 does a nice moistening job so my skin can wait for a while after I get out of the shower and shave; used to be that I had to run to the face cream.  Good stuff, this, and a real close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Co-enzyme they&#x27;re talking about, well, it&#x27;s not on the list of ingredients and I think it&#x27;s a joke, but it is a good shave gel.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Glacial\\&quot; defines my pace of change when it comes to trying new shaving products. I seldom stray from the gel I&#x27;ve been using for...well, since Edge was introduced long ago in the 20th century:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what either the Q10 or the \\&quot;double action\\&quot; refer to, but here&#x27;s what I am sure of: this Nivea gel softens a tough beard and lets the razor move closely and smoothly over your face. Its mild scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, and afterwards my shave feels as close as it ever has with my regular gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re slow to adopt (or even consider) new grooming products, this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li> this is the only shaving gel that the 3 men in my family can use without suffering afterwards. They claim there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> The powerful, musky scent was intolerable to me and my wife. It does not state anywhere on the bottle or the Amazon listing that this gel has a musk odor. If you like a musk odor or use musky cologne, this gel should be fine, but for me, it was off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication and functional ability of this Nivea gel is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a more delicate scent, I recommend [[ASIN:B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]] which works great.</li>
            <li> This is shaving cream. It works. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes me look younger or if its the best etc. but it is good and I get a good shave from it. I can definitely feel the difference between this and really cheap shaving cream... Does it do a better job than regular Gilette? I don&#x27;t know to be honest. I like it better but can&#x27;t really provide a tangible reason as to why....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving gel. This is the best I have found so far. I use a safety razor and the only blades I&#x27;ve found that can get through my stubble are the Feather blades and they require some caution to keep away the cuts. Previously, I used shaving soap, but it dried my skin too much so I decided to move onto a gel. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different gels and this is, by far, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I cut very easily and this limits those to a minimum. The pricing is also very reasonable. If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Nivea for Men Q 10.  The gel is economical, provides excellent lather, and has a clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> pretty good product, i bought them based on their cheaper price, in reality you can find cheaper at CVS but the product is good</li>
            <li> BUT; for what it is this gel is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made in Germany which is probably the best thing about it.  They actually care about quality control and the end product over there.  However, the shaving comfort is not remarkable with this gel.  In fact, it kind of coats your skin with a slippery layer that adds comfort but impedes the blade from cutting your hair.  On a trip away from home I bought a cheap 99 cent can of Barbasol shave foam.  The cheap stuff actually gave me a better closer shave.  Nivea does have a slight pleasant smell to it and the moisturizer built in is probably better for your skin than cheap foam.  This is not a bad product but I will probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea shaving gel for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the CoQ10 one - usually I get the sensitive skin gel that comes in the white can. I decided to try this one though, since, when I bought it, it was a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, really, but I think when I&#x27;m out I&#x27;m going back to the old kind. The gel in this kind is softer and drippier; it&#x27;s got an almost...snotty consistency. (Well, OK, that might be overstating it a bit...but it is less viscous than the gel I&#x27;m used to.) The fragrance is different, too, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoQ10 has a number of health benefits, but I have my doubts as to whether any of them can be delivered through the skin. The can says something about supplying one&#x27;s skin with &amp;#34;new energy&amp;#34; or some such, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve noticed nothing of the kind. My skin looks and feels exactly the same after shaving with this as with any other shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not bad. Not my favorite, either, but it works just fine, and it&#x27;s definitely superior to some of the other brands out there. If you&#x27;re hoping for some sort of miraculous glow from the CoQ10, though, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed - I can&#x27;t believe that that&#x27;s anything but marketing hype.</li>
            <li> This gel makes shaving feel great,,,,It makes my skin feel so good,,,,,,,It takes very little to shave my face,,,,,,It softens the hair, and makes shaving easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream does not irritate my skin, and provides a smother shave than most other types I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s much better than other mainstream brands I&#x27;ve used such as Gillette and Edge.  For this price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream did the job, but i just thought it smelled odd</li>
            <li> Top plastic lid cover was broken in two bottles.&lt;br /&gt; Shaving cream is not smooth as Schick or gillette.I will not consider for second purchase</li>
            <li> Bought for my 17 year old grandson. He says it is great, wakes you up, gives immediate energy to your face and morning focus, just not good to eat!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Face and skin feels healthier than before shaving.  Almost want to use it as a moisturizer.  Since I have thick hair, some spots I have to go over with the razor more than once and most gels/foams need reapplication, but this one doesn&#x27;t and leaves no razor burns or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no more tissue squares populating your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of shaving creams/gels and never really got a good shave out of them. Others I may have gotten a closer shave without the burn, but it smelled way too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q10 I felt made a good compromise between close shave, and minimal &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was after every use it didn&#x27;t continue to drop or foam at the spray nozzle, an annoyance experienced quite frequently with other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Designed to be used with an electric razor that can be cleaned with water.  Just spread the jell on your face and shave with your electric razor.</li>
            <li> I know the brand NIVEA and I was expecting the outstanding performance of this product. My face looks soft and uniformly shaven all the time. I love it and will purchase more when finished with this first pack.</li>
            <li> Nivea  is the best cream out there and this is a bargain  at the price.</li>
            <li> felt comparable to the gillette one. this is is a pump action one though. pressing on the top gives you a pump action to push the gel out.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave with no irritation. Combined with Nivea after shave balm this shaving gel&lt;br /&gt;works great. Recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for over a year, it leaves my faces in great shape I look forward now  to shaving. You should use this shaving gel</li>
            <li> We purchased this 3 pack one year ago, and my son and I are impressed. A little goes a long way. Just prep your beard with a hand towel and hot water, then apply cream, taking time to cover areas deeply, adding a bit of water to thin, and shave with the grain, and you will get the smoothest face you&#x27;ve had in years. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Nivea Sensitive Skin shaving gel and loved it rich body. This gel is not as rich but does the job as well as the Sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave, don&#x27;t have to wait as long for some of the others before it has softened up the face hair enough to shave.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel might be quite nice but the can is poorly constructed. Or at least one of them had a manufacturing defect. I was carrying it in my checked in luggage on a flight. On reaching home I discovered that the nozzle part at the top had come off even though the cap was still on. The gel had oozed out in abundance and left my clothes foamy. Not a big deal since the clothes could be washed. I lost more than half of the gel in the can. But at least the luggage smells very nice now.</li>
            <li> i havent had a chance to try it yet.  i still have some of my old stuff left.  merry christmas.</li>
            <li> It makes my shaving experience alot more comfortable and it feels like it revives my skin in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it too shave in the morning for a easy, and awaking shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would Recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary razor for years - and been pleased.  I just replaced an older Norelco with an AT 810 with the intent of using the Nivea Gel with it - big mistake.  With my past Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used a pre shave lotion.  I thought this might be similar - IT&#x27;S NOT - this is like using shaving cream and a blade, only with a plug - and it&#x27;s sure a lot messier than I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;ll probably return the Nivea - and maybe the razor, too.</li>
            <li> The foam is too oily if that makes any sense... good smell but  just seems to make the blade float over the whiskers for me, but son lives it and wants to reorder</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every shaving cream/gel but have tried many. This stuff is the best shaving cream/gel I have ever used. This product totally turned me into a Nivea for Men fanboy - I use so many of their products I should buy stock, if it existed. Anyway, just a little bit of this stuff expands up into a thick foam and completely covers my face. Couple this with a nice razor and wow what a shave. I used to get pretty bad irratation on my neck from shaving and this stuff has almost completely knock that out. Every once in a while it&#x27;ll flare up but a dab of post-shave balm (Nivea of course) nipps that in the bud. Go ahead and get the 3 pack...if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll throw the other stuff away (oh, and a 3 pack of this will last a very long time since it takes so little).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked this gel so far. A little bit goes a long way and it mixes into a nice thickness. Leaves a minimal cooling sensation which is nice as well</li>
            <li> it is nice on skin. it also foams normally&lt;br /&gt;the price was good. The smell is also ok)&lt;br /&gt;It beat other products by the price, at least this time for me).</li>
            <li> If you look closely the description and the picture do not match up. I was really upset when I figured that out, because I love the smell of the one in the picture. It shipped super fast, so that was a big plus. Once we did get it, turns out the smell is just the same! So amazing price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The best I found, and very glad I started using this product. Kind of funny that every time I visit Walmart and look for Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles, there are always out. At least 3 times I looked and they are all gone, so some people might also agree this is a fine shaving cream. I agree and I am very happy that Amazon carries it, even though I must admit Walmart.com also does. A very nice buy! 4.5 Stars!</li>
            <li> The shaving gel overall is good, I use it to shave my head but i still think I&#x27;m going back to the pinaud shaving cream. Im just use to that and it what the barbers use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Lasts a long time and smells great. 3 bottles goes a long way. We bought these in May of 2013 and I think my husband has only gone through one. It leaves his skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> This one smells and feels great , got it for my husband and he is very satisfied. Definately a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> smells nice and smells stays for a while love it</li>
            <li> This works very well and somehow manages to prevent any razor burn at all. (So far) Unlike airy shaving creams I actually have to press on the razor a bit to get a close shave... but works fine. My only real complaint is that it smells kind of strange and the scent lasts. The aftershave I got is also by Nivea and it&#x27;s scent fades after an hour or so, so i am left with this gel&#x27;s scent. I recommend using an aftershave with a lasting scent if you are going to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea shaving cream, this shaving cream feels thick in my hand. It feels substantial and I really enjoy using it. I do not only use it on my face, but on my head. It works perfect for shaving your head! So all of my bald guys, this is the shaving cream for you.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that the can is over pressurized and tends to release more than needed for a single use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about CoQ10 giving more &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve shaved my head every other day for 10 + years straight so I know my gels, and this one works JUST AS WELL as the more expensive FUSION gels etc. No nicks, fully moisturizes the scalp, and comes at great price.</li>
            <li> I use this sparingly and only buy when on sale.  Otherwise, i use Barbasol for that&#x27;s good stuff.  But this, i like when i need to do my chest or pits.  It&#x27;s excellent for a smooth clean shave and no irretation.</li>
            <li> i usually just purchase plain shaving cream but this gel is actually worth it.  it gives me a closer shave because the razor can get closer to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of the Nivea shaving gels and my main go to gel is the sensitive version of this I saw this on sale and decided to pick it up.....After using it ( with a full grown beard, scruff and a next day shave ) I found that it is similar to the sensitive version just not as comfortable...just a tad bit..dont get me wrong this is a EXCELLENT shaving gel and I will be using it till all 3 of my bottles are finished...My main problem with it is the sent it is for people who shave in the morning it is a fresh scent and you will be able to smell it for atleast a couple of hours...Its kind of a lemony refreshing smell that wakes you up but for me I use cologne and I like to smell the cologne I am wearing and with this until the smell fades it I will not be able to smell it ...</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product. The gel tends to cluster up and does not have a refreshing or clean feel to it - I would recommend spending more for quality and looking at Proraso shave creams.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Nivea breaking off from Gillette. Surprisingly it was amazing experience. Greenish color gel! Foamy and smooth shaving. Loved the bottles also. Leaves less mess after using. No problem on skin, no itching/irritation. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nivea shave gel from Amazon was a little priced, but price is more than offset by how far a small amount of the Nivea gel goes. I have been using from the same can for over 5 weeks and probably still have enough left in the can for several more weeks. Very close, smoothe saves too..</li>
            <li> My journey of shaving gels started many years ago with Edge and later Gillette gels.  Over the years both of those products seem to have become more watered down and chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Nivea shaving gel about two years ago and could not be happier.  The lather is fantastic and smooth and a can lasts me a couple of months.  A little goes a very long ways!  Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
