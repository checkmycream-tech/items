            <li>I had a Sonic toothbrush before and it was great!  </li>
            <li>My dentist said the Sonicare is the best for the teeth and gums, and I agree.</li>

            <li>2 minute timing feature is great also.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about quality, as the price was lower than I had paid for the one that died, but the quality is great.    </li>
            <li>I decided against getting a newer model Sonicare, as it seems  all they did was add frills to spruce up an already great power toothbrush and raise the price as well.</li>
            <li>Gives great value compared to the models with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>It is great for improving the gums and was recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 4 years and it keep my teeth in great condition.</li>
            <li>But my dental checkups have improved greatly.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Product works great.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve gotten great dental check-ups and haven&#x27;t needed \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; since i&#x27;ve used the sonicare 4100.  </li>
            <li>I felt that that feature added a great deal to the effectiveness of the instrument and emailed Philips.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush which I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of owning for about 18 months......and now for the warning......</li>
            <li>I think Sonicare is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The power toothbrush is a great product.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So I bought one from Walmart with a great deal.</li>
            <li>toothbrush worked great for 2.5 years, then the battery started dying.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>(Bonus tip - if you brush twice a day with a Sonicare, you don&#x27;t need to floss, and you STILL get great checkups.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value.</li>
            <li>My son is using this one now in his own bathroom and is very happy with it.  </li>

            <li>Mine worked great for about 4 years, then one of the two handles stopped holding a charge.</li>

            <li>I had been hearing lots of good things about the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes, and my dentist recommended getting a Sonicare specifically, so when I saw this on sale, I had to jump on it.    </li>

            <li>My wife and I have our own Advance Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>(I also own the [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Elite]]</li>
            <li>I own both the Sonicare Advance and the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li>you could replace your own batteries in twenty minutes.......    </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I would give a 5 if it had a Quad pacer that alerts you every 30 seconds, but otherwise this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>But no problem, I can figure this out on my own.</li>
            <li>One nice feature of the Sonicare PS-1</li>
            <li>I never realized how handy it was until I got this unit without the feature.</li>
            <li>The 30-second spacer during a 2-min use is another handy feature.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush is absolutely the best automated toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go out and buy my own</li>
            <li>The 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush is quite effective in giving my teeth and gums that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling (and at preventing gingivitis).    </li>
            <li>Teeth will honestly get cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li>My checkup proved that her recommendation was a good one, because my gums are healthy, no gingivitis</li>
            <li>But now I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It works great and keeps my teeth clean and shiny between visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li>then I have always had a great checkup and my gums are healthy and teeth stay clean.</li>
            <li>Of the three I&#x27;ve used, the braun pulsating is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>As far as how the toothbrush works,  I think it is EXCELLENT.....</li>
            <li>I thought for the money that the Sonex was good too, but they are no longer available, so I&#x27;ve returned to Sonicare with this model.    </li>
            <li>I have had Sonicare for years and they are by far the best electric tooth brush on the market.</li>
            <li>The sonic waves from this toothbrush with sonic waves seem much more effective than the OralBs which just spin.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning thoroughly your teeth and the timer is excellent because I never know how long I should be brushing my teeth for.</li>
            <li>The timer on here is very useful in maintaining a good brushing routine.</li>
            <li>This is a great value, priced right for the quality received.  </li>
            <li>System is a very fine system.  </li>
            <li>It may have been a good time for me to upgrade to the newer model, but I had just purchased two packages of the replacement heads that went with my original model.  </li>
            <li>It would be a very good brush, if it had a more modern rechargable battery.</li>
            <li>I loved how clean my teeth felt afterwords.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and reliable and does a good job of getting your teeth clean and messaging your gums.</li>
            <li>At first, this product was great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the perfect way to introduce tweens to a toothbrush that&#x27;s going to keep their teeth happy, clean and healthy for as long as they need to bite and chew things.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to take care of, and best of all it really does help keep your mouth cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, easy to travel with, and so effective.  </li>
            <li>received quickly,  works good</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of easy to put that off).  </li>
            <li>This a great toothbrush, and really helps to clean teeth well, stimulate gums for good health, get between the teeth and everything you want in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would like the brush to have more movement though.</li>
            <li>(the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush).</li>
            <li>I say more?</li>
            <li>I say more?</li>
            <li>Get the Sonicare Power Toothbrush and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!</li>
            <li>I was able to buy two products instead of one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush and getting it through Amazon was cheaper, faster and easier than going to the store.  </li>

            <li>Love it for traveling also since it keeps</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare and have recommended them to many people over the years and purchased them as gifts for family.     </li>
            <li>Being able to replace batteries with standard cells would have made this toothbrush perfect.    </li>
            <li>and I enjoyed using it all the time.</li>
            <li>Before moving up to the sonicare, I used Braun, but the sonicare is definitely better.</li>
            <li>We enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>Excellent basic oral care.</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush better than braun.</li>

            <li>I have used the Sonicare for many years &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Arizona satisfied</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only been using the 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush for a couple of weeks, I am totally impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>This does not affect the performance of the toothbrush and I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li>I should charge it more often, but I often forget to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the basic Sonicare model and it takes care of your teeth and gums perfectly with no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>(love the quadrapacer feature on my model).</li>
            <li>My wife and I have gotten many of our friends and family using the Sonic brush.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare brush and have for about 3 years</li>

            <li>For more information on model differences and benefits, call Sonicare at 1-800-682-7664</li>
            <li>Make sure the toothbrush is turned off before taking it out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>It shuts off after 2 minutes and I&#x27;m putting effort into making sure</li>
            <li>I have found that my teeth have had fewer cavities and my gums have been healthy while using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>otherwise okay.  </li>
            <li>- I used it most every day, so it received a lot of use.  </li>
            <li>LOVE brushing my teeth with this thing.</li>
            <li>We just love this product and see the benefits of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>OK, I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;idiot\\&quot; warnings to know to move to another quadrant.  </li>
            <li>we can&#x27;t remember how many years.  </li>
            <li>Take good care of your pearly whites and they will take care of your smile.  </li>
            <li>I think think my dentist will be pleased</li>
            <li>I am looking for a better unit as I love the performance of an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Have gotten them for many family members.</li>
            <li>You just hold it in place and let the brush do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It has many Pros.</li>
            <li>I am not doing any more tooth pickings.</li>
            <li>And one more Con, you don&#x27;t know when the battery charge will go away.</li>
            <li>I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REASONABLY-PRICED THAT WOULD DO A BETTER, MORE THOROUGH JOB OF CLEANING MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li>This sonic toothbrush provides the best cleaning possible!!!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you replace the heads when they wear out in order to maintain maximum cleaning power</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>That makes it even better.</li>
            <li>and it does a progressively better job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>My oder was received at record speed and I am completely satisfied witht the product.</li>
            <li>Stuck it back on and it worked perfectly;</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare Advance but as my dentist said, I still need to floss.</li>
            <li>they are more then just the brush as they have the magnet part in it also</li>
            <li>I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have just ordered 2 more for my kids.</li>
            <li>Li-Ion and Li-Poly cells require sophisticated charging and discharging circuitry.  </li>
            <li>The two minute timer is an excellent way to make sure your teeth are brushed as recommended by your dentist or hygentist.</li>
            <li>Love this Sonic Care Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes are the most recommended by dentists.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was time to start taking better care of  my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It keeps my gums healthy and lessens the plaque removal by my hygenist.</li>
            <li>I was so satisfied with it that I bought another one just like it.</li>
            <li>I then ordered a Braun which works OK.</li>
            <li>At my mom&#x27;s urging I purchased one of these just to be sure I&#x27;m brushing well.  </li>
            <li>i am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I just love the invigorating feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>Another plus of the Sonicare is better check up reports from our dentist.</li>
            <li>It cleans better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li>but now I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>My trips to the Dentist have been much More of A Pleasure to go to the Dentist.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I made the change.  </li>
            <li>and when I finally went, they said my teeth and gums were perfect!</li>
            <li>You will love it too.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to use an electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>Love how this works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I use it</li>
            <li>Have used the sonicare since 1997 - could not ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>I love this Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I found my gums don&#x27;t get sore any more as a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace the one I had for many years.</li>
            <li>four co-workers have purchased them and all of them are as pleased with it as I am.  </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended Sonic Care Toothbrush and my gums have been healthy ever since.</li>
            <li>My dental health has never been better than when I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and I have had many cavities in my lifetime.     </li>
            <li>They love them too.</li>
            <li>I get better results with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon.com for DVDs and books and now appliances.</li>
            <li>teeth and gums never felt better.</li>
            <li>I just purchased 3 more to give to my nieces for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>i have used this company&#x27;s product for many years and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The head is thinner and more flimsy.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still enjoying using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not ever sure it was the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>doubt Phillips has built some planned obsolesce into their latest models, but I will be replacing my Sonicare with another Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li>It was built to last and works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush works great - much more power than the older version it replaced -</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older model and am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am just thankful they still offer the Sonicare 4100, as it does exactly what they originally designed it to do, clean teeth remarkable well, and provide a power toothbrush that lasts!</li>
            <li>I did purchase a new Sonicare because this is a great way keep your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought Sonicare for the first time 4 years ago and I loved it.</li>
            <li>It took a week or two for me to get used to brushing with this new brush, but once I did its been great.  </li>
            <li>new one is great</li>
            <li>had the beginning stages of gingavitis in many of my teeth and some more advanced in others.)Since</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and</li>
            <li>Every time I get my teeth cleaned, the dental assistant raves about how clean my teeth are!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know what a clean mouth is until you use a SONICARE toothbrush!</li>
            <li>so they feel clean!  </li>
            <li>The older ones are great, the newer models are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a very good electrical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to all to maintain healthy gums, teeth and good dental checkups.</li>
            <li>I started noticing my teeth becoming whiter as well after 3 weeks of using it</li>
            <li>Our old Sonicare has been working great for -</li>
            <li>Re-purchased my old model and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits, this brush will definitely help you out; and if you already have great dental hygiene, this is only a bonus!</li>
            <li>Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who wants good teeth.</li>
            <li>The whole unit is fairly compact.</li>
            <li>It shuts off after two minutes, sits nicely on my vanity, and after filling out the registration I&#x27;m getting 27.99 worth of coupons</li>
            <li>This new combination provides me with a more superior brushing performance to remove plaque.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, and the diabolically designed packaging, the Advance 4100 product is excellent.</li>
            <li>Have no idea why they even created other ones when the 4100 is the very best in show.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its wonderful.</li>
            <li>Other than the battery problems they are superb toothbrushes.     </li>
            <li>It is also easy to travel with too.  </li>
            <li>This product performed as advertised and was easy to set up.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the toothbrush is easy.  </li>
            <li>It is the best of any of the Sonicare toothbrushes and well worth the money, especially here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Ordering was easy.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grab for me.</li>
            <li>5 stars had it been designed to allow the user the option to easily replace the batteries when they died as well as</li>
            <li>Also, one charge lasts 2 week easily for this brush.  </li>
            <li>a way\\&quot; product which could easily be designed to have replacement batteries.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth so shiny and squeaky clean and my gums look healthy too</li>
            <li>Makes it easy with the built in timer.</li>
            <li>I love how clean it gets my teeth.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend replacing the brush head with the newer brush head replacements for the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have used a Phillips sonicare for about 10 years now and was very pleased to be able to order a new on to match the one I wore out.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty good in making your brushing time adequate.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush and liked it.</li>
            <li>The two-minute auto shut-off is helpful, since it ensures a consistent and effective brushing period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I have switched to the E series brush heads as they are more readily available than the original heads.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and due to Amazon&#x27;s FABULOUS return policy and excellent customer service...</li>
            <li>The length of time it would hold a charge went down over the years, but it functioned perfectly all this time.</li>
            <li>worked great, fast shipping, thank you very much</li>
            <li>Good unit but plan on buying a new one every two years.  </li>
            <li>and I know that the new models (the ones with the skinny neck) are not as good (for me anyway)</li>
            <li>No fancy angled head, and the battery is good for two weeks (brand new)</li>
            <li>At the price I got it for, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal but the replacement heads cost almost as much as the price I paid for the unit in the first place.</li>
            <li>It was fine while it worked</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>The timer gives a good indication of how long I should be brushing and keeps me &#x27;honest&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Product price and delivery were fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over one month and all the bristles seems to be in fine shape.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare was purchased in 2002 and it performed perfectly until this year the battery finally would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>during this time the battery performance has gradually deteriorated from keeping its charge for up to 14 days to just 3 days if I&#x27;m lucky!</li>
            <li>Got it quickly and no problems!</li>
            <li>And even though it&#x27;s recommended that one brush one&#x27;s teeth for the full 2 minute cycle, I frequently end up brushing for 4 or more minutes since it feels so good</li>
            <li>Easy to use and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Switching to a electric vs hand brush has made a huge difference for my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li>Huge fan.</li>
            <li>and she says it is making a huge difference</li>
            <li>As well, my teeth feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>We feel they are great tooth brushed.</li>
            <li>I got it at such a great deal too.</li>
            <li>you know oral hygiene is important to me.  </li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>The 4100 appears to have been discontinued but is still available thorugh Amazon &amp; Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price, and I still find it better than Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, you probably don&#x27;t enjoy making trips to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>both he and the hygenist said my gums looked great and improved from the last time I was in.(I</li>
            <li>They are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, Sonicare sent me a coupon for a free head if I buy 2 heads.  </li>
            <li>My husband travels a great deal and needs a toothbrush that will hold a charge for several days.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy brushing with the Sonicare 4100 knowing that I&#x27;m helping to prevent gum disease.  </li>
            <li>so i called sonic care toll free</li>
            <li>For the bean counters, NiCads are cheap to source.  </li>
            <li>I bought this here for $55.00 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>My dentist bugged me to get another, and since this model is cheap, I got it.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and and feel it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush takes a bit of getting used to, but it does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is cheap compared to the investment in dental work if not used.  </li>
            <li>I have a year left to wear them and I feel great about how my teeth will look after the braces come off.</li>
            <li>I already owned a Sonicare 4100 and it has been a very reliable and effective tool.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean up and keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it is still light, it is heaver than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that  when it  died</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wierd buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>She said her teeth eel smooth all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten good mileage so far out of the batteries.</li>
            <li>- i knew better than to leave it on the charger, it would last a good 10 days and then about a week</li>
            <li>The first unit died after eight years - I thought that was pretty good life expectancy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Sonicare 4100, the old model, because I have used one for six or seven years and loved it</li>
            <li>So far so good with the philips on all counts.</li>
            <li>It has been good except it needs frequent charging.</li>
            <li>Sure enough I did and look forward to another 6 years of good service.</li>
            <li>Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li>I had my first one for 5 years and just bought a new one (for a great price at Amazon).</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions to use it right.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li>the very handy 30 second timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very good toothbrush, it&#x27;s my second one the first lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>product is very easy to use and is very user Friendly.</li>
            <li>The 4100 is not as sexy as the new Sonicare brushes but it works and I love it.</li>
            <li>It took four years to wear the battery out on the first one, but after four years of healthy checkups there is no way I would change this habit.</li>
            <li>Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000.</li>
            <li>(Although,  the batteries on my original toothbrush lasted 10 years)</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush significantly improved dental health for myself and my wife.</li>
            <li>I gave as a christmas  gift to both of my adult children - they are very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was an original user of Sonicare, then switched to the $20 Sonex brand when the Sonicare battery died.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so I keppt the original purchase.  </li>
            <li>I needed a replacement for my first one when the batteries died after many years of service.    </li>
            <li>The brushes come in a set of two each with a unique color band.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend more money on an Elite, then definitely go for one of these because it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a Sonicare for my husband and it worked</li>
            <li>The original company was Sonicare and independantly owned.</li>
            <li>My original one wore out in 5 years.</li>
            <li>My original one had it, this ones does not.</li>
            <li>I love how it works and makes my teeth feel, my first one broke.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clean teeth quite as well as hoped.  </li>
            <li>and it looks clean.</li>
            <li>It removes plaque much more effective than regular hand brushing.    </li>
            <li>and it provides unmatchable clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>Having bought this for my husband &amp; myself around Christmas, I think everybody with teeth should use this to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>and it makes my teeth and mouth feel refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li>The teeth feel crispy clean and polished just like a trip to the dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>But when it comes to getting your teeth sparkling clean and impressing your dentist, this one gets the job done just as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a while it feels like the spaces between your teeth do not get as clean as the surfaces and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything you can do about it.  </li>
            <li>Every time I go into the dentist now, I always get complimented on how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat ultrasonic for getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean just like I came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel soooo clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li>A good set of rechargeable batteries should last anywhere from 300-900 charge cycles, but the Sonicare is using a unique wireless charging system that may or may not have a detrimental impact on the batteries.      </li>
            <li>one might not have the special 30-second quadrant brushing beeps that some newer ones have.</li>
            <li>This was on special</li>
            <li>The special price by Amazon allowed me to get everyone in my family one.</li>
            <li>Since he got the Sonicare, cleanings are much more pleasant and less work.  </li>
            <li>But it does take a little practice and learning the best technique at first.</li>
            <li>And my hygienist never fails to comment on how clean my teeth are!  </li>
            <li>One good thing about the Sonicare is that it cleans very gently if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Outstadning products and great price reduction since buying our first Sonicare 4100 several years ago.  </li>
            <li>We were so happy to find the same exact on on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>While even the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now, I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using this electric toothbrush, which I have used this same brand for over 10 years, the dentist always tells me what good teeth I have.  </li>
            <li>I give full credit to my Sonicare Advance.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare makes your teeth feel so much cleaner, and I have had better check-ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The unit turns off after two minutes, and that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>Back in 1997, I thought I was doing a good job brushing my teeth with a manual brush once a day.  </li>
            <li>I liked my old one better, because it had the \\&quot;Quadrapacer\\&quot; feature, which beeped every 30 seconds to help you know how much time is remaining on the 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>the warranty is only good for 2 years.</li>
            <li>After awhile I switched back to my toothbrush and realized I wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job around the gumbline as I was with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Amex paid for the replacement via a full purchase price refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do feel the healthy difference of investing in this product.      </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>A basic Sonicare at a good price</li>
            <li>and I thought he was full of it.</li>
            <li>it has been dropped off the sink several times and still works as good as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for $40.00.</li>
            <li>Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention.</li>
            <li>This was true of many older devices with rechargable batteries.  </li>
            <li>sure what I can do about it, except buy a new one!</li>
            <li>And it also makes your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The E-Series  Replacement Brush Heads are smaller and better able to reach the hard-to-reach areas in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought replacement brush heads from Amazon with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This older, classic design is simple the BEST.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY WITH GUM PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li>I saw a special on the Sonicare 4100 in the Golden Box and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Says his teeth feel clean even right after waking up.     </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with my return to an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is the very first generation of the Philips Sonicare line.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and I am very satisfied that my teeth and gums will be healthier.</li>
            <li>I initially received this toothbrush as a birthday gift from my husband and I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime I bought a new Braun, which was the toothbrush we&#x27;d used for the two years before the Sonicare, with much better results.</li>
            <li>Sure they have \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and according to my dentist is responsible for the improvement of my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>It really works and if they would make it easy to replace the rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is super powerful .</li>
            <li>I had my first one for several years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It definitely cleans much better than the A-Series Brush Heads!</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON!!</li>
            <li>The company was eager to replace, but it was \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; at best, the head and neck are weak.  </li>
            <li>I actually missed the sonicare more than him!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first Sonicare Advance in 1999 and am still using it!</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!!</li>
            <li>THANKS Sonicare!!</li>
            <li>Superficially, \\&quot;more teeth\\&quot; sounds more positive, but we all know that technically shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Also, I bought the compact head, which seems great; even with this extra purchase it was a lot less than the more advanced models.</li>
            <li>takes a little getting used to, but a great tooth brush  stick with it, you get used to it</li>
            <li>It has a nice little plastic cap on top of the bristles so you don&#x27;t get germs on the head when not in use.</li>
            <li>Powerful vibrations remove material from teeth and gums in two minutes.  </li>
            <li>The only feature that will make you purchase a more advanced model of Sonicare is the quad pacer.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yet I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li>A great brush but too expensive to purchase and own.</li>
            <li>you smile.  </li>
            <li>Far more vigorous brushing than can be done by hand.</li>
            <li>I find using the compact head brush unit (rather than the regular) fits more comfortably in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>You can purchase another set of two brushes in two different colors so a family of four could each have their own color to avoid mixup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become addicted and brush more than twice a day (3-5 times a day) which is great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>4 years, isn&#x27;t that worth it?  </li>
            <li>The difference is night and day, the Sonicare is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost of purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years and really liked how it worked before it finally died</li>
            <li>Pay the additional $$ and get those features--they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>These brushes make brushing fun.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time user of a sonic toothbrush and I love my new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, SERIOUS, toothbrush, for super clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li>other wise I just leave mine on my sink with out the charger, so that it doesn&#x27;t clutter my vanity.  </li>
            <li>Even though there are more advanced power toothbrushes out there, my family has had this model since it first came out several years ago.  </li>
            <li>and he was right.........</li>
            <li>This item was never received, but upon calling Amazon  a replacement was sent right away</li>
            <li>I take it right off of the charger and use it</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away</li>
            <li>The Sonicare works as advertised, noticed a difference right away -</li>
            <li>My dentist noticed the difference right away and recommended that I continue to use it.    </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended and he was right.</li>
            <li>The price was right at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>really liked the run-up feature, where the brush works more gently for the first few times, till you get used to it, then at full speed.</li>
            <li>Teeth really feel clean after use.  </li>
            <li>No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other electric brush work like this or better than this.  </li>
            <li>really recommend the Sonicare Essence since it hits the sweet spot for price vs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend the Sonicare Essence since it hits the sweet spot for price vs. features.    </li>
            <li>I think it is better than a spin brush just for the fact it seems to move the way one generally brushes.  </li>
            <li>Once I was able to extricate the components from the infernal clam shell packaging, no small chore, the brush was ready for use.  </li>
            <li>Not bad considering how much I use it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I ordered the same model again, because I was so pleased with the first one!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent brush for the price, most other Sonicare brushes are easily over $100.</li>
            <li>free shipping and discount for new Amazon credit card was not honored, so I did not reorder.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, it really gets my teeth clean and white.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is better than sonic for a gentle yet complete brushing in a 2 to 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This also means more waste and many will be thrown away with the batteries which is an enviromental disaster.</li>
            <li>A Sonicare is totally worth the price you pay, although I don&#x27;t feel you don&#x27;t need anything more than the basic model.</li>
            <li>It just beeps to tell you when to move to the next area of your mouth, doesn&#x27;t sound important but it does help.</li>
            <li>I am quite certain the technology to do so is available because I knew people that bought theirs ten or fifteen years ago and theirs are still going strong.</li>
            <li>If the tissue is healthier with normal &#x27;pocket depths,&#x27; then the Braun products, or manual toothbrush used with good technique are fine; but overall, they still do not leave the tissue as healthy (firm) as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I miss the timer very much.  </li>
            <li>yet so I can&#x27;t attest to the battery life, but so far recharging every time I&#x27;m done is working just fine.  </li>
            <li>They last for many years</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty comparable to the Braun.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I felt like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using Sonicare for so many years, the 30 second timing is so part of my memory</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 3 years, and the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li>However, some of the newest Sonicare models do pulse at a higher speed.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s still on her first handle.     </li>
            <li>it massages your gums(mine bled the first use because i have not been flossing</li>
            <li>my teeth looked whiter after the first use.this toothbrush makes brushing fun.it makes oral b electric and</li>
            <li>Much better than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric tooth brush</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the Sonicare to last more than one year MAXIMUM.  </li>
            <li>This is probably one of Sonicare&#x27;s most basic models.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this when I made the purchse.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare without whitening toothpaste makes my teeth look better than they did when I was using a regular toothbrush with whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I am a dental hygienist and have seen many results from the use of various electric brushes.  </li>
            <li>But at Wal-Mart it remains $10.00 higher in price, plus sales tax.</li>
            <li>My first lasted 3 years and then one day just stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>However, the newer models have a higher vibration per minute.  </li>
            <li>A jump from about 20,000 vbm on this model up to 31,000 vbm on the Essence, Healthy White and Flexcare models.</li>
            <li>Replaced a similar model that I had owned for many years.  </li>
            <li>This sonicare 4100 is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>I usually do 2 minutes on the top teeth and then two minutes on the bottom teeth, and I just love the way my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>you first start to use a Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush, you&#x27;ll have to become accustomed to the vibrations and tingling sensations that occur.  </li>
            <li>I have never used an electric toothbrush before and even after the first time</li>
            <li>The sonicare toothbrush that I bought works exactly like the advertising says it does.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>First let&#x27;s start with how I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford the higher end Sonicare models and I just need the Sonicare tooth cleaning functionality, not all fancy timers...</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST VENTURE INTO THE MARKET OF ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for 3 years.</li>
            <li>What I was looking for was a replacement battery that would fit my old charger stand.</li>
            <li>My first SONICARE was purchased about 8 years ago</li>
            <li>I remember the first visit to the dentist after I started using it and</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain too much about that!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The crossaction regular toothbrush that I switched from worked better in that respect.  </li>
            <li>Cleans much better then a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>After the first charge over night, just use it and return it to the cradle.</li>
            <li>Similar to many people here, my dentist suggested that I start using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Conversely, NiCads take a lot of abuse and in an application of this size, they provide more than enough storage capacity.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Sonicare about 9-10 years ago at the urging of my dentist.</li>
            <li>So check BBB first before buying it here.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 other Sonicare toothbrushes and love them!</li>
            <li>We all received better dental checkups on our next visit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have my Sonicare back.  </li>
            <li>The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  </li>
            <li>I had problem teeth and gums until I purchased my first Sonicare at the suggestion of my dentist.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever used a Sonicare was years ago</li>
            <li>but I can say that with each and every use, this brush delivers the most thorough cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had outside of the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>it is my first time to use sonicare.</li>
            <li>It really did whiten my teeth as they claim!  </li>
            <li>When I went to the dentist, they had brouchures about this exact model.</li>
            <li>Can be a bit \\&quot;ticklish\\&quot; at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The first Sonicare I ever bought lasted exactly one year before it died.  </li>
            <li>IT cleans well, and tickles at first</li>
            <li>My skepticism turned to surprise and pleasure after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My first one just died and I replaced it with a like model.  </li>
            <li>My dentist noticed my healthy gums after using it for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>My first lasted about eight years</li>
            <li>Whether you get the basic model, or the elite, nothing else works better.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I used SoniCare for our toothbrush - bought our first one in 1994.</li>
            <li>Really love it and will definitely get another if and when this one gives out.</li>
            <li>This purchase is a replacement for one of similar model we used for many years.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about 9 years before the battey case deteriorated from the charging heat.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews complaining about the short battery life of the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Had my first Advance 4100 about 3.5 years</li>
            <li>This new tooth brush takes a little getting used to, but it does a great job of cleaning your teeth even tho</li>
            <li>The new one works even better than the old one---which is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find that the Sonicare Advance I purchased fits the three e series brush heads that I still have when my previous Sonicare&#x27;s battery gave way.  </li>
            <li>The reason for the improvement is simple: though using a regular toothbrush is good for the teeth &amp; gums, it is simply not physically possible for anyone to brush as rapidly or with as many strokes (31,000 strokes per minute) as the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my adult life I got a clean bill of health from the dentist and this was after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>and I got my first when I was pregnant with my 10 year old!  </li>
            <li>Bought new Sonicare to replace old one which finally gave out after a number of years of good service.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush gets your teeth clean, and I have noticed that it does better than my previous oral b toothbrush at removing stains.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember this dentist clean feel after brushing with my old tootbrushes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the next ten years will result in a superior product -  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about the 2 minute timer not being enough, then simply press the button again and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>I feel the 4100 will be phased out soon replaced by new models, I&#x27;m sure the new models are better but the old one is still miles above what anything else can do!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this specific product to anyone looking to switch to an electric toothbrush - while I have not spent much time researching other models, this one seems to be one of the more reasonably priced (for what you get) and delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li>However, the cadmium in NiCads is highly toxic and not exactly the most environmentally friendly option for batteries.  </li>
            <li>It has lost some of its former power, even at full charge, then when I bought it new but still works fine.</li>
            <li>My bottom teeth aren&#x27;t straight and flossing was always a nightmare; now I just brush first and flossing&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used SONICARE for a long time and love it.</li>
            <li>(In fact, he and his wife have been using this for a long time and they are 100 % satisfied).</li>
            <li>In fact, when the battery died in my first one, I really missed it</li>
            <li>We really like these soniccare products, but replaced the first one because it quit working after 4 years, whic isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all, we only get one set of adult teeth, so keeping them healthy is well worth the cost of the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It gives a good cleaning over back and flat surface of the teeth too...</li>
            <li>After charging full when we got this product, it runs seamlessly for about 1-1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better.  </li>
            <li>No dental professional will tell you this, but it true for me.</li>
            <li>My advice --- get the one that gives you this helpful little signal AND check your electrical supply before you replace a perfectly good (SEVEN year old!) appliance!</li>
            <li>It works great and the charge lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s not very portable and again, the bacteria issue is something that needs to be resolved.</li>
            <li>Since I started to use the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush just over a year ago, my gums have never again bled while brushing my teeth (as they once periodically did), my teeth are whiter and my dentist &amp; dental hygienist have been very pleased with the vast improvements in my personal dental health that have resulted.  </li>
            <li>She revised her initial diagnosis and said I was OK to resume a normal checkup/cleaning schedule every six months.  </li>
            <li>The brushes easily screw on and off the unit and can be placed in a stand until the next use.  </li>
            <li>The entire product is compact and can easily be packed for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy with a regular toothbrush to shortcut the brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have loved my sonicare brush however they are very expensive to own.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be buying another Philips.</li>
            <li>It was a replacement for the old one I had for some 10 years and the new one works even better than the old one when it was new!!</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it only cost about $10/year to have fantastic oral care.</li>
            <li>The new 4100 is exactly as good as my earlier 4100 except that I was unaware that it comes either with or without the feature to let you know when each 30 seconds of the 2 minute cycle is up.  </li>
            <li>It really is much better than a regular old electric!</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommends throwing out regular toothbrushes and using only the Sonicare for better protection of teeth and gums!   </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are very high quality, the built-in timer is helpful, and I recommend it.  </li>
            <li>but I am on my 2nd or maybe 3rd, can&#x27;t remember for sure, but they are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Compared to manual it leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner.</li>
            <li>and I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li>really.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out $150 for the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Get the Sonicare Power Toothbrush and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!n to a different section of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for giving a bargin in a time when its needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stronger, yet surprisingly gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>Still I apprecite the quality and how much cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s important to keep my gums and teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li>T has really improved my teeth and my visits to the dentist.    </li>
            <li>but I really was impressed.)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>as usual, I&#x27;m very pleased with how it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>While this brush does not have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive models do, it is a great, simple item that does its job well.</li>
            <li>I can also really see that my gums are healthier.  </li>
            <li>This is my forth Sonicare toothbrush, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush,</li>
            <li>It works really well if you have any sort of dental work like permanent retainers, braces, etc.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>It Cleans the teeth really well.</li>
            <li>However, it only takes a couple of brushings before it feels completely comfortable.</li>
            <li>Since the battery is non-replaceable, the whole thing has to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>the machine turns off after its allocated 2 minutes of brushing, does it really also need sub-timed sequences for each quadrant of the mouth?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand to rinse with it for the whole 60 seconds</li>
            <li>They have really made a difference in my gum health.</li>
            <li>like the idea that this unit does not need much charging.</li>
            <li>Feels like your holding a real tool while your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads on that newer design are harder to change than the ones on the 4100, and it takes up more room on the counter.  </li>
            <li>some getting used to, but if you are a coffee drinker you will really see the difference in the whiteness of your teeth.</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist recommeded this item and it works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, dentist grade</li>
            <li>No breakdowns whatsoever and the price is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li>However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  </li>
            <li>but they were very pricey.  </li>
            <li>This item keeps the kids brushing really well.  </li>
            <li>I could immediately tell that this tooth brush was for real.  </li>
            <li>Sonic uses a gentle massage</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not and I am about to tick a box promising that.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and was glad to fiind it as the local stores had more expensive replacements with more stuff than I needed.</li>
            <li>It arrived in very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>so you could gauge how much time to spend in each section of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recomment this product!  </li>
            <li>This one, however, doesn&#x27;t have 2 important features:  the 30-second interval indicator so that you can cover all 4 quadrants of your teeth; and and low battery indicator.  </li>
            <li>It really works, belive it or not.  </li>
            <li>They delete the charger, probably built it much cheaper</li>
            <li>Because the product does do what it is supposed to do, and it does it reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Problem is the replacement heads cost almost as much as the unit.  </li>
            <li>31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Most people will be surprised how short it is.  </li>
            <li>I wore the old one out after 6 or so years and was glad to find another of the same.</li>
            <li>Have used this style product for years, junked my old one which was not bad at all for the new 9500 series.  </li>
            <li>At the cost that they are, that is pretty pricey plus &gt;$10 per new head.</li>
            <li>I offered to pay for shipping and cost of the batteries, but they advised that they don&#x27;t provide that service, but would be willing to sell me a new one at a discount.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers say, it&#x27;s a good idea not to charge after every use and instead only when depleted (NiCd battery).  </li>
            <li>The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Wanted the same excellent product, obviously one changes the brushes regularly, but the electric part lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>In the very beginning I did not like it, but quickly got so used to it, that I just do not feel my teeth are really clean when I use a conventional toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>The original one came with that feature, and I didn&#x27;t even know they now have it as an extra option.  </li>
            <li>This equates to about 56 minutes of total run time, which means that the original batteries installed in the Sonicare were ~600 mah.  </li>
            <li>There are, however, lots of other features which make the Elite a  better brush.  </li>
            <li>This model is inexpensive and very similar to our original model, but I miss the quadrapace feature.  </li>
            <li>Give or take a couple features, they all clean teeth equally well.</li>
            <li>My teeth looked better, I had a lot less plaque build-up, and my gums were pink and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The clean feeling after brushing can only be matched by when you walk out of the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>This makes sure you are brushing for at least two full minutes.  </li>
            <li>my teeth simply don&#x27;t feel clean like they do when I use my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>However, for someone with a normal to large orifice, this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replacement for the brush heads are easy to find in almost any major general store.</li>
            <li>Amazon has never let me down on their prices, products, or their fast, sometimes FREE shipping!</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended by my Dentist and has performed very well.</li>
            <li>think the only good thing about it is that it stimulates your gums really well because of the vibration, but unfortunately a toothbrush needs to do more than just that.</li>
            <li>Yes, a cheapo tooth brush will get the job done if you are diligent have a proper brushing technique but with the sonic I clean for a full two minutes get all the teeth inside and outside plus cleaning the tongue surface.</li>
            <li>The next time my dad went for his usual cleaning, the dentist was amazed at how clean and nice looking his teeth were.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous unit with more bells and whistles but costs twice as much to replace.</li>
            <li>It especially helps older people clean between their teeth and end that</li>
            <li>pros: gets your teeth super clean, use less toothpaste    </li>
            <li>My 23 year old daughter had her first two cavities in her life.</li>
            <li>The first time I used my old Sonicare</li>
            <li>but i think overall this is a sweet cleaner....</li>
            <li>Before I purchased my first Sonicare, I had been diagnosed as being in the early stages of peridontal disease and my dentist recommended I try one.  </li>
            <li>I saw this one on Amazon, which is exactly like my old one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I can still recommend this Advance 4100 unit, even though I won&#x27;t be surprised if it dies even quicker than the first one.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I can still recommend this Advance 4100 unit, even though I won&#x27;t be surprised if it dies even quicker than the first one.</li>
            <li>It all comes down to if you want that 30-second prompt, paying up to 20 more bucks or not.</li>
            <li>But, for $40, I got a sealed brand new toothbrush, charging station, and an additional brush head(I had just purchased 2 replacement heads)!</li>
            <li>My teeth are cleaner and the backs of the teeth, which is hard to get clean the old way, are better.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I seem to go through more of them with this model than the previous two.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the older one&#x27;s model number</li>
            <li>I tried to screw it back in and noticed a crack up the side of the battery housing and a larger crack around the top.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a newbie to Sonicare, you should know that the Sonicare Advance 4100 Power Toothbrush is an older model.</li>
            <li>I like this older model</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is more noisy than former models, and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to the different wave form of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>This particular toothbrush has everything you need.</li>
            <li>The sonicare advance 4100 power toothbrush was purchased as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li>It does shut off after 2 minutes but the 30 second timer is only in more costlier models.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have used this product daily for more than 10 years...and the unit was placed back into the charger after each and every use!!!</li>
            <li>Stick with the classic.</li>
            <li>I get better dental checkups using Sonicare twice a day than I did when I used it only once a day and flossed daily.)</li>
            <li>The main unit comes with a charger/stand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it matters which particular model of the Sonicare you get.  </li>
            <li>main two things that take adjusting are the wider handle and the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>I had one of the older Sonicare Advance models before the Elite came out.  </li>
            <li>I find the brushes last for well over 3 months for me and tend to replace them only after 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>While it is a bit pricey for replacement heads, it is a decent trade off for the dental health it provides.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I had my first cavities filled in two decades last year, and that wasn&#x27;t inexpensive (or fun) either.</li>
            <li>Whenever I run my tongue across the surfaces of my teeth after every brushing, it always gives me great satisfaction to feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist - no more gritty tooth surfaces resulting from the buildup of plaque and/or tartar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this toothbrush, I can really tell a difference when I rub my tongue against my teeth and gums, wow!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this toothbrush, I could see an instant change in the appearance of my teeth and gumline.</li>
            <li>Just hope this lasts as long as the original one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anybody, the Sonicare does all the work....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li>crest electric(battery powered) brushes seem like kids stuff compared to the high rpm&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the sonicare, whichever you choose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this brush for cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare has been highly recommended by our dentist (and also by our family orthodontist for our children.)  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li>I also wish that the device could be powered by eneloops or other rechargeables--it would reduce the waste of a used unit a great deal.</li>
            <li>I look forward to clean teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li>No manufacturer will EVER tell you that little tidbit for reasons I&#x27;m sure you can figure out yourself.</li>
            <li>Compared to NiCads, Nickel Metals would be a better environmental choice but would provide little performance benefit.      </li>
            <li>You have to get used to the sensation, and it ramps up a little more each time in the beginning.</li>
            <li>As long as it has the sonic action it will work fine.....</li>
            <li>I have had 2 Sonicare brushes which did a great job, but they failed after about 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>Great product, altho replacement heads tend to be expensive</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping this one alive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will last just as long.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you wind up with toothpaste decorating your bathroom mirror, your clothes, and pretty much the entire area around your bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the 4 series still offers the 30 second pause function, and if it doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know that I would have paid more than $20 extra for the function to get one of the newer series.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, can you think of the last time you brushed your teeth with a regular toothbrush for 2 minutes at one time?  </li>
            <li>did follow all precautions for taking care of the NiCd battery by draining all charges before recharging which is normally once a week.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>this was a replacement sonscare toothbrush - it performs very well - after tis first charge i have brushed 20 times and its still going</li>
            <li>First off, the Sonicare absolutely helps enormously with keeping tartar at bay.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush for anyone in the market for new one.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this model does not have the 30 second pacer, which I really loved with my original one.  </li>
            <li>Since you can turn the Sonicare right back on again, this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Far superior to the newer Sonicare series, which have brushes too small for a normal sized male mouth.</li>
            <li>The other ones are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Based on this new information, instead of the original 5 star rating that I gave Sonicare, I now give Sonicare a 2 star rating since I do not believe that the value for the dollar spent is there.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare for about 10 years, and when I bought this new one, I just assumed it would have the quad-pacer that lets you know when 30 seconds is up</li>
            <li>Now I know I could have just bought a new battery unit.</li>
            <li>new unit (after two months) is working well, does the customary job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Oral B user forever; I&#x27;ve now found the \\&quot;new way.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have the entry level sonicare, and have been using it for 2 years nonstop, and change the heads every 6-8 months, and still works like new when fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to buy new heads at the six month mark, so</li>
            <li>My Mom has used both the 4100 and now has a new Essence.  </li>
            <li>I discovered that Sonicare does not replace batteries, therefore you have to purchase a completely new item.  </li>
            <li>The new one,    </li>
            <li>would either unwillingly buy a new one or find a competing product whith replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li>A new Essence model in on the way from Amazon as the Advance appears to be phased out of the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one i did copay on it</li>
            <li>I got some new brushheads for it, charged it up</li>
            <li>Mine is like brand new.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They were bought out by Philips and if you read the box on the new brushes you&#x27;ll see its a Philips Elec.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem these things have is that bases die eventually, and then you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;new&#x27; models.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s so they can claim a new &#x27;slant head&#x27; innovation.</li>
            <li>To try to get you to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something easy to remember when your half awake and brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li>, feels like the newer versions don&#x27;t really add much in the way of actual tooth-cleaning functionality.  </li>
            <li>The thing I DO NOT LIKE about this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t let me know every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to another part of my mouth (like my old one does).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently at all, and so far it has proven to be very durable-</li>
            <li>The older 4100 has a lot more crevices (holding bacteria) and is a lot thicker (making it more difficult to reach the back of the mouth) than the newer models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would very much recommend this or similar Sonicare product.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll read the product features more carefully before ordering!</li>
            <li>I only wish that this model had the 30 second intervals like the original model I purchased over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I am on my second one after the first</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this exact item.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ticklish from the toothbrush they use in dentists&#x27; offices, you&#x27;ll have the same problem at first from this one.  </li>
            <li>I cannot compare this product with others (since is the first and only one I have used)</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these that I have had, the first on lasted about 8-10 years.</li>
            <li>I have since purchaser extra heads for ours and bought one for each of our married daughters and their husbands.</li>
            <li>So I purchased the same exact one again.</li>
            <li>I am not a \\&quot;flosser\\&quot;, and the first time I went to have my teeth cleaned after using the toothbrush for several months, they were amazed at the lack of placque on my teeth!  </li>
            <li>so it would die even sooner, dropped the price somewhat and likely get an even higher profit margin.</li>
            <li>I will buy the cheapest model I can find since I know it will clean my teeth as well or better than an expensive model.</li>
            <li>While I am pleased with the overall performance, I don&#x27;t especially like the fact that this model has a short battery life, necessitating complete replacement every two years.  </li>
            <li>Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li>New one works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>I had just bought new brushes for our old one</li>
            <li>My old one has this feature, the new one does not.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new Sonicare toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare that gave up the ghost after 11 years.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare because the battery died in the first one which was about 3 years old.  </li>
            <li>so you know how long to brush the top, front and back, and the bottom row, front and back.  </li>
            <li>This is my second brand of electric toothbrush, and is much better for my mouth than the previous brand.</li>
            <li>And they have brought down the price from the original $100 bucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fanatic about keeping clean teeth and at my last checkup didn&#x27;t even have to have a cleaning as there was no plaque or tartar to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I entirely buy their claims about whitening and such, but it does a decent job of keeping my teeth clean in-between regular dental cleanings.</li>
            <li>If you floss and use this toothbrush twice daily you will certainly be doing your \\&quot;homework\\&quot; as far as oral hygiene is concerned.</li>
            <li>When it died after about a year and a half I got a Braun, the original model.</li>
            <li>It is a little bulky at the handle, but it has a nice smaller brush head (since I have a smaller mouth</li>
            <li>It is several years old and still brushing very well, neither of us having any complaints.  </li>
            <li>For some time now I&#x27;ve spent a fortune buying cheap imitations thinking it&#x27;s the same as a pricier toothbrush the likes of Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Just like the old one, this one runs for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Advance 4100 used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and they aren&#x27;t as sensitive,  </li>
            <li>and i am 50 years old, so</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my old sonicare toothbrush, since I had unused brush heads which do not fit the newer models available in stores near me.  </li>
            <li>We had an old Sonic Care toothbrush that looks like this but had the Quad Pacer.</li>
            <li>It must have been 7 or 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an old Sonic that I used for over 6 years until the battery would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>: it has no &#x27;Quadpacer&#x27; (as did my old unit)</li>
            <li>The only real downside, I do have to add is</li>
            <li>Old Sonicare 4100 lasted 7 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>This replaced a Sonicare that was 5 years old.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare beeped every 30 seconds to remind me to switch brushing areas.</li>
            <li>Ours were about 5 or 6 yrs old ...</li>
            <li>s is about 7 yrs old...</li>
            <li>Works with old charger and brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the basic model, but that&#x27;s really all you need.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and thorough at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have tried the  \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>But it does have one flaw that I am surprised that Sonicare has not address yet.</li>
            <li>It felt a bit strange using it the first time, just as it says in the instructions.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare helped save my adult teeth, and for that I give it my highest recommendation.e</li>
            <li>My only quibbles are really advocacy items:</li>
            <li>so while it doesn&#x27;t provide a spinning motion for brushing, it does vibrate and help you brush near the gums without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the next time the brush was used, it didn&#x27;t seem to be vibrating much.</li>
            <li>As far as the vibration when you start using it may take a week to get use to it and yes close your mouth</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well the battery lasted.</li>
            <li>Now we have a his and a hers, much to our total satifaction.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement for my old Sonicare (which lasted about 7 yrs, by the way).  </li>
            <li>I gave this one a five star rating based on the lifespan of my old one.  </li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product</li>
            <li>Takes the guess work on cleaning by automatic shut off feature when brushing is complete.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling like a professional job was done in cleaning my teeth every time.</li>
            <li>Sure it sucks that the battery can&#x27;t be replaced</li>
            <li>Thus far, my brush has always lasted that length of time.  </li>
            <li>nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace an 8 year old Sonicare Advance.  </li>
            <li>I had assumed it would last much longer.</li>
            <li>had the old Advance 4100 model here (and almost no one else did) for $45</li>
            <li>Realize that you can only make but so much money selling a toothbrush (or a can of dog food or a cigarette lighter or whatever)  ... and that if management turns it into a piece of c**p through cost-cutting, well, people will stop buying it altogether.</li>

            <li>My 15 year old Sonicare toothbrush just died.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money to step up to the next model for me....</li>
            <li>Initially, the sensation was one of \\&quot;ticklling\\&quot; but after a few uses it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you can afford a few more dollars, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite model.  </li>
            <li>However, the price was right compared to the newer more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Finally I searched on Amazon and found one at the right price (finally cheaper after 4 years) and bought it!   </li>
            <li>The only other difference that I noticed is that the button light does not blink while charging and stop when finished.</li>
            <li>Recently, I finally replaced a very old unit with new one (Model 4100), which I purchased from Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the expected lifetime of the battery is 5 years or more, the NiCD have a &#x27;memory effect&#x27; and to get rid of it you have to run the brush down to near zero power.  </li>
            <li>There are a few issues with the fact that even if I clean the inside of the toothbrush head, it still collects bacteria there and this seems to be an issue of design of the product.  </li>
            <li>When it does I will seriously consider the cost difference before dropping a lot more money when this one has served me so well.</li>
            <li>I just purchased my second one after the first one finally wore out.</li>
            <li>So when I finally graduated and got a decent job with health benefits, I figured it was time to schedule an appointment.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted almost 3 years after daily use by 3 different people.  </li>
            <li>It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li>but my dentist recommended I start using the older Advance model because it has a larger and deeper penetrating head.</li>
            <li>The Advance 4100 lets you know when you have brushed 2 minutes although it doesn&#x27;t do the 30 second beeps like our first one.  </li>
            <li>This is the second unit I have purchased, the first lasting about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does the same job as my older model.</li>
            <li>(Sure hope those few pennies saved make up for the LONG time customers you are going to lose.)</li>
            <li>With my vast improvement in dental health and whiter teeth, I give a resounding 5 out of 5 star rating to the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush and highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush   Highly recommended, have used one for the last five years.  </li>
            <li>No cavities in 6 years with noticeably cleaner teeth even with a high daily coffee intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all cases, the areas between the teeth need regular attention, ie floss, go-betweens, proxybrushes, stimulators, or other effective tools which stimulate the gums and break down bacteria.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to buy a new one as the old one was beginning to show signs of wear.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought a new one now is the batteries died on the old one....</li>
            <li>Replaced old 4100 with new one BUT they neglect to say that this model no longer has the 30 second timer.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare finally crapped out and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>This Sonicare toothbrush works fine, except it does not do the little pause every 30 seconds (as advertised and last one did) to let one know when he is nearing the 2 minute shut-off.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, use of a regular toothbrush simply cannot provide as much cleansing action as the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is probably not a good idea for most of us to use toothpastes with silica \\&quot;whiteners\\&quot; with a brush like this -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put mine back on the charger after everytime I use it, so at the end of two weeks, the battery is kind of weak.  </li>
            <li>The handle is several times thicker than a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I now get 10 seconds of brushing out of the handle and have gone back to normal toothbrushing until I decide which electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>and I also remove the entire head, clean it out, then wipe it down with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>If you could replace the two AA batteries in the Sonicare without a big hassle,  you would probably never have to buy a new one again.....</li>
            <li>We ordered a new Sonicare to replace the one that had given us over five years of daily use by two adults.  </li>
            <li>it worked VERY well for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using my Sonicare brush my gums have improved 100% and my smile is wide and white.</li>
            <li>When I went back three months later, she was amazed at how much my oral health had improved.  </li>
            <li>If you take steps (i.e. using tape for waterproofing to supplement for poor construction and completely drying the unit off and charger off after every use) you may be able to get a longer life out of it.  </li>
            <li>The first 2-3 days are needed to get used to the action of the brushing and my gums got a little sensitive as a result.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll not go back to the old brush again!</li>
            <li>My sister originally recommended the 4 series to me (in 1999) because she had to have skin grafts because of excessive brushing, which I also tend to do.  </li>
            <li>This is a major pain as the battery itself takes up 24 hours to fully recharge each time.</li>
            <li>And in the rare case I have gotten stuck away from home unexpectedly and had to use a plain toothbrush</li>
            <li>since converted to the e-series AA battery model which is now going past 5 years, and its battery is strong and reliable, because I can replace it myself and it needs to be recharged only every 3-4 months using eneloop</li>
            <li>even if it is a little pricey, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Messy to use when mouth is open to clean front teeth etc.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and you could  buy a hundred decent regular toothbrushes in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   </li>
            <li>a day brushing compared to nearly a week when new, mainly because even if powered to &#x27;near&#x27; zero you can&#x27;t really deep discharge these batteries without unmounting it, which means destroying the handle.  </li>
            <li>but my teeth, in general, feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li>There is supposed to be a fraction of a second stop action built into the product.</li>
            <li>I am a mature male with siblings fighting gum disease--not me.  </li>
            <li>Philips has apparently decided to boost the sales of their E-Series Replacement Bush Heads by tapping into the market for owners of the Philips Sonicare Advance 4100.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and the sensitivity is starting to diminish.  </li>
            <li>I had the old sonicare for several years.  </li>
            <li>The old toothbrush charger charges this, so we only need one charger out.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this design feature is to avoid over brushing.  </li>
            <li>far outways its competitors especially for helping to stabilize periodontal disease in conjunction with a 2-4 month visit for perio maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy another one, old style because I have xtra brush ehads already, but I will definitely continue with the sonicare...</li>
            <li>If fact, I went on a trip and used my old electirc toothbrush, and I felt as if I hadn&#x27;t even brushed.</li>
            <li>In the early years, I actually had forgotten to charge it and did make 2 weeks on one charge.</li>
            <li>if there is a low battery reminder beep like my old one yet.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your wide variety of products that can be ordered from your site.</li>
            <li>Over the last ten-fifteen years, every dental professional I knew preferred Sonicare over \\&quot;Aural-B.\\</li>
            <li>good to verify that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the batteries dying...</li>
            <li>If I take the cynical view, it&#x27;s good for sonicare yo</li>
            <li>The angle of the brush makes it kind of hard to brush without making a mess.   </li>
            <li>because they are very rough and noisy whereas the 4100 is very gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t notice it missing right away</li>
            <li>The main patient complaint I have gotten is that the brush is too vigorous for them, but those complaints are few compared to those who are pleased.  </li>
            <li>In terms of features, the three newer models are ranked low to high respectively with Essence at the low end.     </li>
            <li>The only negative is the sound, it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li>brush is advertised as having four (4) 30 second stages (two minutes total) in the brushing action</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge back to normal though, about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>After using my first Sonicare for the past 6 years and having no problems at all, it was quite natural that I would be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>It works well when used properly ask your dentist or hygenist you will be surprised on the basic tips that can save you time in the chair.</li>
            <li>This is my second model, as the battery finally quite in the old model after 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li>And since Sonicare is clearly establishing a pattern of going on the cheap and cheaper, inventing new models to obsolete the old models, and doing whatever they can to get you to keep buying new toothbrushes, I can only figure that when this new one eventually shuts down, whatever Sonicare has on the market then will be little more than worthless c**p.</li>

            <li>I just bought a new brush head over the weekend and they&#x27;re up to $20 now for a single and $30 for a pair.(2 October, 2006)</li>
            <li>I am now using a stopwatch which is a little bit of a pain first thing in the morning, but</li>
            <li>The more expensive models do have more features, but the basic model cleans just as well for less than half the price of the top-of-line model.  </li>
            <li>On my first purchase  I noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they are  supposed to last, cracked in less than 3 months.    </li>
            <li>The only thing missing on the Advance 4100 that was on the older model is that the Advance 4100 runs for a continuous, uninterrupted two minutes while the older model beeped every 30 seconds during a two-minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>It cost half than what the other brands charge (I had gotten it on sale here for $40) and it leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>You dont need to waste a lot of toothpaste for this as this fast action brush creates enough foam for cleaning.</li>
            <li>My old one quit after 8 long years.  </li>
            <li>and then discovering that the &#x27;trusted&#x27; company decided to make a few pennies more per item and killed the 30 second timer on &#x27;low-end&#x27; items.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the brush head is kinda large, the bristles a little too soft for my taste, and the shaft is short so it can be to clean my back teeth</li>
            <li>My other only complaint (OK, I guess I have two) is that Sonicare turns off after about two minutes, the time it has determined it should take you to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist said the newer models aren&#x27;t much different, as they apparently just have different fancy timing options (which seem gimmicks to me).  </li>
            <li>I had been using an ordinary manual toothbrush, and my checkups were good, but not great.</li>
            <li>Alas, it has a built it timer, so can&#x27;t just leave it on so it will run down on its own.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also offers competitive pricing on the single replacement brushes, so you don&#x27;t need to leave home to search when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I let it die and recharged, I left it on the charger, i tried anything and everything to get it back to at least doing a full brushing - nothing.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush was a complete waste of my money, and now I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Not that it would die in the first week, only to avoid the potential dead battery in the second week.</li>
            <li>used to the oral b toothbrush, so it took a little getting used to, but really like the way this one cleans my teeth and</li>
            <li>Use is much easier if you put a little toothpaste on your fingetip and rub it on your front teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new one and it is performing just as my other one did, and has met all my expectations.    </li>
            <li>I brush my tongue without the power because I prefer doing that very gently a couple times as opposed to the \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; done by this small appliance.  </li>
            <li>I think the 2-minute timer is both good and bad.  </li>

            <li> I had a Sonic toothbrush before and it was great!  </li>
            <li> My dentist said the Sonicare is the best for the teeth and gums, and I agree.</li>

            <li> 2 minute timing feature is great also.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about quality, as the price was lower than I had paid for the one that died, but the quality is great.    </li>
            <li> I decided against getting a newer model Sonicare, as it seems  all they did was add frills to spruce up an already great power toothbrush and raise the price as well.</li>
            <li> Gives great value compared to the models with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> It is great for improving the gums and was recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 4 years and it keep my teeth in great condition.</li>
            <li> But my dental checkups have improved greatly.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Product works great.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve gotten great dental check-ups and haven&#x27;t needed \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; since i&#x27;ve used the sonicare 4100.  </li>
            <li> I felt that that feature added a great deal to the effectiveness of the instrument and emailed Philips.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush which I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of owning for about 18 months......and now for the warning......</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So I bought one from Walmart with a great deal.</li>
            <li> toothbrush worked great for 2.5 years, then the battery started dying.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> (Bonus tip - if you brush twice a day with a Sonicare, you don&#x27;t need to floss, and you STILL get great checkups.  </li>
            <li> This is a great value.</li>
            <li> My son is using this one now in his own bathroom and is very happy with it.  </li>

            <li> I had been hearing lots of good things about the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes, and my dentist recommended getting a Sonicare specifically, so when I saw this on sale, I had to jump on it.    </li>

            <li> My wife and I have our own Advance Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> (I also own the [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Elite]]</li>
            <li> I own both the Sonicare Advance and the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> you could replace your own batteries in twenty minutes.......    </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I would give a 5 if it had a Quad pacer that alerts you every 30 seconds, but otherwise this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> But no problem, I can figure this out on my own.</li>
            <li> One nice feature of the Sonicare PS-1</li>
            <li> I never realized how handy it was until I got this unit without the feature.</li>
            <li> The 30-second spacer during a 2-min use is another handy feature.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is absolutely the best automated toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go out and buy my own</li>
            <li> The 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush is quite effective in giving my teeth and gums that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling (and at preventing gingivitis).    </li>
            <li> Teeth will honestly get cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> My checkup proved that her recommendation was a good one, because my gums are healthy, no gingivitis</li>
            <li> But now I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> It works great and keeps my teeth clean and shiny between visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> then I have always had a great checkup and my gums are healthy and teeth stay clean.</li>
            <li> Of the three I&#x27;ve used, the braun pulsating is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> As far as how the toothbrush works,  I think it is EXCELLENT.....</li>
            <li> I thought for the money that the Sonex was good too, but they are no longer available, so I&#x27;ve returned to Sonicare with this model.    </li>
            <li> I have had Sonicare for years and they are by far the best electric tooth brush on the market.</li>
            <li> The sonic waves from this toothbrush with sonic waves seem much more effective than the OralBs which just spin.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning thoroughly your teeth and the timer is excellent because I never know how long I should be brushing my teeth for.</li>
            <li> The timer on here is very useful in maintaining a good brushing routine.</li>
            <li> This is a great value, priced right for the quality received.  </li>
            <li> System is a very fine system.  </li>
            <li> It may have been a good time for me to upgrade to the newer model, but I had just purchased two packages of the replacement heads that went with my original model.  </li>
            <li> It would be a very good brush, if it had a more modern rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> I loved how clean my teeth felt afterwords.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and reliable and does a good job of getting your teeth clean and messaging your gums.</li>
            <li> At first, this product was great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the perfect way to introduce tweens to a toothbrush that&#x27;s going to keep their teeth happy, clean and healthy for as long as they need to bite and chew things.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to take care of, and best of all it really does help keep your mouth cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to travel with, and so effective.  </li>
            <li> received quickly,  works good</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of easy to put that off).  </li>
            <li> This a great toothbrush, and really helps to clean teeth well, stimulate gums for good health, get between the teeth and everything you want in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would like the brush to have more movement though.</li>
            <li> (the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush).</li>
            <li> I say more?</li>
            <li> I say more?</li>
            <li> Get the Sonicare Power Toothbrush and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!</li>

            <li> Love it for traveling also since it keeps</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and have recommended them to many people over the years and purchased them as gifts for family.     </li>
            <li> Being able to replace batteries with standard cells would have made this toothbrush perfect.    </li>
            <li> and I enjoyed using it all the time.</li>
            <li> Before moving up to the sonicare, I used Braun, but the sonicare is definitely better.</li>
            <li> We enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> Excellent basic oral care.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush better than braun.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.  </li>

            <li> I have used the Sonicare for many years &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Arizona satisfied</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using the 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush for a couple of weeks, I am totally impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> This does not affect the performance of the toothbrush and I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I should charge it more often, but I often forget to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the basic Sonicare model and it takes care of your teeth and gums perfectly with no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> (love the quadrapacer feature on my model).</li>
            <li> My wife and I have gotten many of our friends and family using the Sonic brush.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare brush and have for about 3 years</li>

            <li> Make sure the toothbrush is turned off before taking it out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It shuts off after 2 minutes and I&#x27;m putting effort into making sure</li>
            <li> I have found that my teeth have had fewer cavities and my gums have been healthy while using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> otherwise okay.  </li>
            <li> - I used it most every day, so it received a lot of use.  </li>
            <li> LOVE brushing my teeth with this thing.</li>
            <li> We just love this product and see the benefits of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;idiot\\&quot; warnings to know to move to another quadrant.  </li>
            <li> we can&#x27;t remember how many years.  </li>
            <li> Take good care of your pearly whites and they will take care of your smile.  </li>
            <li> I think think my dentist will be pleased</li>
            <li> I am looking for a better unit as I love the performance of an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Have gotten them for many family members.</li>
            <li> You just hold it in place and let the brush do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It has many Pros.</li>
            <li> I am not doing any more tooth pickings.</li>
            <li> And one more Con, you don&#x27;t know when the battery charge will go away.</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REASONABLY-PRICED THAT WOULD DO A BETTER, MORE THOROUGH JOB OF CLEANING MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush provides the best cleaning possible!!!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you replace the heads when they wear out in order to maintain maximum cleaning power</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> That makes it even better.</li>
            <li> and it does a progressively better job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My oder was received at record speed and I am completely satisfied witht the product.</li>
            <li> Stuck it back on and it worked perfectly;</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Advance but as my dentist said, I still need to floss.</li>
            <li> they are more then just the brush as they have the magnet part in it also</li>
            <li> I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have just ordered 2 more for my kids.</li>
            <li> Li-Ion and Li-Poly cells require sophisticated charging and discharging circuitry.  </li>
            <li> The two minute timer is an excellent way to make sure your teeth are brushed as recommended by your dentist or hygentist.</li>
            <li> Love this Sonic Care Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the most recommended by dentists.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was time to start taking better care of  my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It keeps my gums healthy and lessens the plaque removal by my hygenist.</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied with it that I bought another one just like it.</li>
            <li> I then ordered a Braun which works OK.</li>
            <li> At my mom&#x27;s urging I purchased one of these just to be sure I&#x27;m brushing well.  </li>
            <li> i am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I just love the invigorating feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> Another plus of the Sonicare is better check up reports from our dentist.</li>
            <li> It cleans better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li> but now I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> My trips to the Dentist have been much More of A Pleasure to go to the Dentist.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I made the change.  </li>
            <li> and when I finally went, they said my teeth and gums were perfect!</li>
            <li> You will love it too.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use an electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> We love them.</li>
            <li> Love how this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I use it</li>
            <li> Have used the sonicare since 1997 - could not ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li> I love this Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I found my gums don&#x27;t get sore any more as a bonus.  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace the one I had for many years.</li>
            <li> four co-workers have purchased them and all of them are as pleased with it as I am.  </li>
            <li> Dentist recommended Sonic Care Toothbrush and my gums have been healthy ever since.</li>
            <li> My dental health has never been better than when I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and I have had many cavities in my lifetime.     </li>
            <li> They love them too.</li>
            <li> I get better results with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon.com for DVDs and books and now appliances.</li>
            <li> teeth and gums never felt better.</li>
            <li> I just purchased 3 more to give to my nieces for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> i have used this company&#x27;s product for many years and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The head is thinner and more flimsy.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still enjoying using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not ever sure it was the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> doubt Phillips has built some planned obsolesce into their latest models, but I will be replacing my Sonicare with another Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> It was built to last and works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works great - much more power than the older version it replaced -</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older model and am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I am just thankful they still offer the Sonicare 4100, as it does exactly what they originally designed it to do, clean teeth remarkable well, and provide a power toothbrush that lasts!</li>
            <li> I did purchase a new Sonicare because this is a great way keep your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought Sonicare for the first time 4 years ago and I loved it.</li>
            <li> It took a week or two for me to get used to brushing with this new brush, but once I did its been great.  </li>
            <li> new one is great</li>
            <li> had the beginning stages of gingavitis in many of my teeth and some more advanced in others.)Since</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and</li>
            <li> Every time I get my teeth cleaned, the dental assistant raves about how clean my teeth are!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know what a clean mouth is until you use a SONICARE toothbrush!</li>
            <li> so they feel clean!  </li>
            <li> The older ones are great, the newer models are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a very good electrical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to all to maintain healthy gums, teeth and good dental checkups.</li>
            <li> I started noticing my teeth becoming whiter as well after 3 weeks of using it</li>
            <li> Our old Sonicare has been working great for -</li>
            <li> Re-purchased my old model and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits, this brush will definitely help you out; and if you already have great dental hygiene, this is only a bonus!</li>
            <li> Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who wants good teeth.</li>
            <li> The whole unit is fairly compact.</li>
            <li> It shuts off after two minutes, sits nicely on my vanity, and after filling out the registration I&#x27;m getting 27.99 worth of coupons</li>
            <li> This new combination provides me with a more superior brushing performance to remove plaque.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, and the diabolically designed packaging, the Advance 4100 product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Have no idea why they even created other ones when the 4100 is the very best in show.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> Other than the battery problems they are superb toothbrushes.     </li>
            <li> It is also easy to travel with too.  </li>
            <li> This product performed as advertised and was easy to set up.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the toothbrush is easy.  </li>
            <li> It is the best of any of the Sonicare toothbrushes and well worth the money, especially here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Ordering was easy.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grab for me.</li>
            <li> 5 stars had it been designed to allow the user the option to easily replace the batteries when they died as well as</li>
            <li> Also, one charge lasts 2 week easily for this brush.  </li>
            <li> a way\\&quot; product which could easily be designed to have replacement batteries.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth so shiny and squeaky clean and my gums look healthy too</li>
            <li> Makes it easy with the built in timer.</li>
            <li> I love how clean it gets my teeth.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend replacing the brush head with the newer brush head replacements for the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have used a Phillips sonicare for about 10 years now and was very pleased to be able to order a new on to match the one I wore out.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty good in making your brushing time adequate.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush and liked it.</li>
            <li> The two-minute auto shut-off is helpful, since it ensures a consistent and effective brushing period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I have switched to the E series brush heads as they are more readily available than the original heads.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and due to Amazon&#x27;s FABULOUS return policy and excellent customer service...</li>
            <li> The length of time it would hold a charge went down over the years, but it functioned perfectly all this time.</li>
            <li> worked great, fast shipping, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Good unit but plan on buying a new one every two years.  </li>
            <li> and I know that the new models (the ones with the skinny neck) are not as good (for me anyway)</li>
            <li> No fancy angled head, and the battery is good for two weeks (brand new)</li>
            <li> At the price I got it for, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal but the replacement heads cost almost as much as the price I paid for the unit in the first place.</li>
            <li> It was fine while it worked</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> The timer gives a good indication of how long I should be brushing and keeps me &#x27;honest&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Product price and delivery were fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over one month and all the bristles seems to be in fine shape.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was purchased in 2002 and it performed perfectly until this year the battery finally would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> during this time the battery performance has gradually deteriorated from keeping its charge for up to 14 days to just 3 days if I&#x27;m lucky!</li>
            <li> Got it quickly and no problems!</li>
            <li> And even though it&#x27;s recommended that one brush one&#x27;s teeth for the full 2 minute cycle, I frequently end up brushing for 4 or more minutes since it feels so good</li>
            <li> Easy to use and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Switching to a electric vs hand brush has made a huge difference for my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li> Huge fan.</li>
            <li> and she says it is making a huge difference</li>
            <li> As well, my teeth feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> We feel they are great tooth brushed.</li>
            <li> I got it at such a great deal too.</li>
            <li> you know oral hygiene is important to me.  </li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> The 4100 appears to have been discontinued but is still available thorugh Amazon &amp; Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price, and I still find it better than Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you probably don&#x27;t enjoy making trips to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> both he and the hygenist said my gums looked great and improved from the last time I was in.(I</li>
            <li> They are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, Sonicare sent me a coupon for a free head if I buy 2 heads.  </li>
            <li> My husband travels a great deal and needs a toothbrush that will hold a charge for several days.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing with the Sonicare 4100 knowing that I&#x27;m helping to prevent gum disease.  </li>
            <li> so i called sonic care toll free</li>
            <li> For the bean counters, NiCads are cheap to source.  </li>
            <li> I bought this here for $55.00 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> My dentist bugged me to get another, and since this model is cheap, I got it.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and and feel it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes a bit of getting used to, but it does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is cheap compared to the investment in dental work if not used.  </li>
            <li> I have a year left to wear them and I feel great about how my teeth will look after the braces come off.</li>
            <li> I already owned a Sonicare 4100 and it has been a very reliable and effective tool.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean up and keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is still light, it is heaver than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that  when it  died</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wierd buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> She said her teeth eel smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten good mileage so far out of the batteries.</li>
            <li> - i knew better than to leave it on the charger, it would last a good 10 days and then about a week</li>
            <li> The first unit died after eight years - I thought that was pretty good life expectancy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Sonicare 4100, the old model, because I have used one for six or seven years and loved it</li>
            <li> So far so good with the philips on all counts.</li>
            <li> It has been good except it needs frequent charging.</li>
            <li> Sure enough I did and look forward to another 6 years of good service.</li>
            <li> Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li> I had my first one for 5 years and just bought a new one (for a great price at Amazon).</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions to use it right.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li> the very handy 30 second timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush, it&#x27;s my second one the first lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> product is very easy to use and is very user Friendly.</li>
            <li> The 4100 is not as sexy as the new Sonicare brushes but it works and I love it.</li>
            <li> It took four years to wear the battery out on the first one, but after four years of healthy checkups there is no way I would change this habit.</li>
            <li> Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000.</li>
            <li> (Although,  the batteries on my original toothbrush lasted 10 years)</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush significantly improved dental health for myself and my wife.</li>
            <li> I gave as a christmas  gift to both of my adult children - they are very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was an original user of Sonicare, then switched to the $20 Sonex brand when the Sonicare battery died.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so I keppt the original purchase.  </li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my first one when the batteries died after many years of service.    </li>
            <li> The brushes come in a set of two each with a unique color band.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to spend more money on an Elite, then definitely go for one of these because it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a Sonicare for my husband and it worked</li>
            <li> The original company was Sonicare and independantly owned.</li>
            <li> My original one wore out in 5 years.</li>
            <li> My original one had it, this ones does not.</li>
            <li> I love how it works and makes my teeth feel, my first one broke.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clean teeth quite as well as hoped.  </li>
            <li> and it looks clean.</li>
            <li> It removes plaque much more effective than regular hand brushing.    </li>
            <li> and it provides unmatchable clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> Having bought this for my husband &amp; myself around Christmas, I think everybody with teeth should use this to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> and it makes my teeth and mouth feel refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li> The teeth feel crispy clean and polished just like a trip to the dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> But when it comes to getting your teeth sparkling clean and impressing your dentist, this one gets the job done just as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a while it feels like the spaces between your teeth do not get as clean as the surfaces and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything you can do about it.  </li>
            <li> Every time I go into the dentist now, I always get complimented on how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t beat ultrasonic for getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean just like I came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel soooo clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li> A good set of rechargeable batteries should last anywhere from 300-900 charge cycles, but the Sonicare is using a unique wireless charging system that may or may not have a detrimental impact on the batteries.      </li>
            <li> one might not have the special 30-second quadrant brushing beeps that some newer ones have.</li>
            <li> This was on special</li>
            <li> The special price by Amazon allowed me to get everyone in my family one.</li>
            <li> Since he got the Sonicare, cleanings are much more pleasant and less work.  </li>
            <li> But it does take a little practice and learning the best technique at first.</li>
            <li> And my hygienist never fails to comment on how clean my teeth are!  </li>
            <li> One good thing about the Sonicare is that it cleans very gently if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Outstadning products and great price reduction since buying our first Sonicare 4100 several years ago.  </li>
            <li> We were so happy to find the same exact on on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> While even the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now, I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using this electric toothbrush, which I have used this same brand for over 10 years, the dentist always tells me what good teeth I have.  </li>
            <li> I give full credit to my Sonicare Advance.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare makes your teeth feel so much cleaner, and I have had better check-ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The unit turns off after two minutes, and that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> Back in 1997, I thought I was doing a good job brushing my teeth with a manual brush once a day.  </li>
            <li> I liked my old one better, because it had the \\&quot;Quadrapacer\\&quot; feature, which beeped every 30 seconds to help you know how much time is remaining on the 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> the warranty is only good for 2 years.</li>
            <li> After awhile I switched back to my toothbrush and realized I wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job around the gumbline as I was with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Amex paid for the replacement via a full purchase price refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do feel the healthy difference of investing in this product.      </li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> A basic Sonicare at a good price</li>
            <li> and I thought he was full of it.</li>
            <li> it has been dropped off the sink several times and still works as good as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for $40.00.</li>
            <li> Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention.</li>
            <li> This was true of many older devices with rechargable batteries.  </li>
            <li> sure what I can do about it, except buy a new one!</li>
            <li> And it also makes your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The E-Series  Replacement Brush Heads are smaller and better able to reach the hard-to-reach areas in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li> Luckily, I bought replacement brush heads from Amazon with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This older, classic design is simple the BEST.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY WITH GUM PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li> I saw a special on the Sonicare 4100 in the Golden Box and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Says his teeth feel clean even right after waking up.     </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with my return to an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the very first generation of the Philips Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am very satisfied that my teeth and gums will be healthier.</li>
            <li> I initially received this toothbrush as a birthday gift from my husband and I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime I bought a new Braun, which was the toothbrush we&#x27;d used for the two years before the Sonicare, with much better results.</li>
            <li> Sure they have \\&quot;new</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and according to my dentist is responsible for the improvement of my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> It really works and if they would make it easy to replace the rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is super powerful .</li>
            <li> I had my first one for several years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cleans much better than the A-Series Brush Heads!</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> The company was eager to replace, but it was \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; at best, the head and neck are weak.  </li>
            <li> I actually missed the sonicare more than him!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare Advance in 1999 and am still using it!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!!</li>
            <li> THANKS Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> Superficially, \\&quot;more teeth\\&quot; sounds more positive, but we all know that technically shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Also, I bought the compact head, which seems great; even with this extra purchase it was a lot less than the more advanced models.</li>
            <li> takes a little getting used to, but a great tooth brush  stick with it, you get used to it</li>
            <li> It has a nice little plastic cap on top of the bristles so you don&#x27;t get germs on the head when not in use.</li>
            <li> Powerful vibrations remove material from teeth and gums in two minutes.  </li>
            <li> The only feature that will make you purchase a more advanced model of Sonicare is the quad pacer.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yet I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> A great brush but too expensive to purchase and own.</li>
            <li> you smile.  </li>
            <li> Far more vigorous brushing than can be done by hand.</li>
            <li> I find using the compact head brush unit (rather than the regular) fits more comfortably in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> You can purchase another set of two brushes in two different colors so a family of four could each have their own color to avoid mixup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted and brush more than twice a day (3-5 times a day) which is great.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> 4 years, isn&#x27;t that worth it?  </li>
            <li> The difference is night and day, the Sonicare is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost of purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years and really liked how it worked before it finally died</li>
            <li> Pay the additional $$ and get those features--they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes make brushing fun.  </li>
            <li> I am a first time user of a sonic toothbrush and I love my new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, SERIOUS, toothbrush, for super clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li> other wise I just leave mine on my sink with out the charger, so that it doesn&#x27;t clutter my vanity.  </li>
            <li> Even though there are more advanced power toothbrushes out there, my family has had this model since it first came out several years ago.  </li>
            <li> and he was right.........</li>
            <li> This item was never received, but upon calling Amazon  a replacement was sent right away</li>
            <li> I take it right off of the charger and use it</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works as advertised, noticed a difference right away -</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed the difference right away and recommended that I continue to use it.    </li>
            <li> Dentist recommended and he was right.</li>
            <li> The price was right at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> really liked the run-up feature, where the brush works more gently for the first few times, till you get used to it, then at full speed.</li>
            <li> Teeth really feel clean after use.  </li>
            <li> No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other electric brush work like this or better than this.  </li>
            <li> really recommend the Sonicare Essence since it hits the sweet spot for price vs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really recommend the Sonicare Essence since it hits the sweet spot for price vs. features.    </li>
            <li> I think it is better than a spin brush just for the fact it seems to move the way one generally brushes.  </li>
            <li> Once I was able to extricate the components from the infernal clam shell packaging, no small chore, the brush was ready for use.  </li>
            <li> Not bad considering how much I use it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I ordered the same model again, because I was so pleased with the first one!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent brush for the price, most other Sonicare brushes are easily over $100.</li>
            <li> free shipping and discount for new Amazon credit card was not honored, so I did not reorder.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, it really gets my teeth clean and white.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is better than sonic for a gentle yet complete brushing in a 2 to 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This also means more waste and many will be thrown away with the batteries which is an enviromental disaster.</li>
            <li> A Sonicare is totally worth the price you pay, although I don&#x27;t feel you don&#x27;t need anything more than the basic model.</li>
            <li> It just beeps to tell you when to move to the next area of your mouth, doesn&#x27;t sound important but it does help.</li>
            <li> I am quite certain the technology to do so is available because I knew people that bought theirs ten or fifteen years ago and theirs are still going strong.</li>
            <li> If the tissue is healthier with normal &#x27;pocket depths,&#x27; then the Braun products, or manual toothbrush used with good technique are fine; but overall, they still do not leave the tissue as healthy (firm) as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I miss the timer very much.  </li>
            <li> yet so I can&#x27;t attest to the battery life, but so far recharging every time I&#x27;m done is working just fine.  </li>
            <li> They last for many years</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty comparable to the Braun.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I felt like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using Sonicare for so many years, the 30 second timing is so part of my memory</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 3 years, and the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> However, some of the newest Sonicare models do pulse at a higher speed.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s still on her first handle.     </li>
            <li> it massages your gums(mine bled the first use because i have not been flossing</li>
            <li> my teeth looked whiter after the first use.this toothbrush makes brushing fun.it makes oral b electric and</li>
            <li> Much better than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric tooth brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the Sonicare to last more than one year MAXIMUM.  </li>
            <li> This is probably one of Sonicare&#x27;s most basic models.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of this when I made the purchse.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare without whitening toothpaste makes my teeth look better than they did when I was using a regular toothbrush with whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and have seen many results from the use of various electric brushes.  </li>
            <li> But at Wal-Mart it remains $10.00 higher in price, plus sales tax.</li>
            <li> My first lasted 3 years and then one day just stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> However, the newer models have a higher vibration per minute.  </li>
            <li> A jump from about 20,000 vbm on this model up to 31,000 vbm on the Essence, Healthy White and Flexcare models.</li>
            <li> Replaced a similar model that I had owned for many years.  </li>
            <li> This sonicare 4100 is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I usually do 2 minutes on the top teeth and then two minutes on the bottom teeth, and I just love the way my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> you first start to use a Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush, you&#x27;ll have to become accustomed to the vibrations and tingling sensations that occur.  </li>
            <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before and even after the first time</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush that I bought works exactly like the advertising says it does.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> First let&#x27;s start with how I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford the higher end Sonicare models and I just need the Sonicare tooth cleaning functionality, not all fancy timers...</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST VENTURE INTO THE MARKET OF ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted for 3 years.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for was a replacement battery that would fit my old charger stand.</li>
            <li> My first SONICARE was purchased about 8 years ago</li>
            <li> I remember the first visit to the dentist after I started using it and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much about that!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The crossaction regular toothbrush that I switched from worked better in that respect.  </li>
            <li> Cleans much better then a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> After the first charge over night, just use it and return it to the cradle.</li>
            <li> Similar to many people here, my dentist suggested that I start using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Conversely, NiCads take a lot of abuse and in an application of this size, they provide more than enough storage capacity.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare about 9-10 years ago at the urging of my dentist.</li>
            <li> So check BBB first before buying it here.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other Sonicare toothbrushes and love them!</li>
            <li> We all received better dental checkups on our next visit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have my Sonicare back.  </li>
            <li> The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  </li>
            <li> I had problem teeth and gums until I purchased my first Sonicare at the suggestion of my dentist.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used a Sonicare was years ago</li>
            <li> but I can say that with each and every use, this brush delivers the most thorough cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had outside of the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> it is my first time to use sonicare.</li>
            <li> It really did whiten my teeth as they claim!  </li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist, they had brouchures about this exact model.</li>
            <li> Can be a bit \\&quot;ticklish\\&quot; at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The first Sonicare I ever bought lasted exactly one year before it died.  </li>
            <li> IT cleans well, and tickles at first</li>
            <li> My skepticism turned to surprise and pleasure after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My first one just died and I replaced it with a like model.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed my healthy gums after using it for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> My first lasted about eight years</li>
            <li> Whether you get the basic model, or the elite, nothing else works better.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I used SoniCare for our toothbrush - bought our first one in 1994.</li>
            <li> Really love it and will definitely get another if and when this one gives out.</li>
            <li> This purchase is a replacement for one of similar model we used for many years.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about 9 years before the battey case deteriorated from the charging heat.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews complaining about the short battery life of the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Had my first Advance 4100 about 3.5 years</li>
            <li> This new tooth brush takes a little getting used to, but it does a great job of cleaning your teeth even tho</li>
            <li> The new one works even better than the old one---which is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find that the Sonicare Advance I purchased fits the three e series brush heads that I still have when my previous Sonicare&#x27;s battery gave way.  </li>
            <li> The reason for the improvement is simple: though using a regular toothbrush is good for the teeth &amp; gums, it is simply not physically possible for anyone to brush as rapidly or with as many strokes (31,000 strokes per minute) as the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my adult life I got a clean bill of health from the dentist and this was after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> and I got my first when I was pregnant with my 10 year old!  </li>
            <li> Bought new Sonicare to replace old one which finally gave out after a number of years of good service.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets your teeth clean, and I have noticed that it does better than my previous oral b toothbrush at removing stains.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember this dentist clean feel after brushing with my old tootbrushes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the next ten years will result in a superior product -  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about the 2 minute timer not being enough, then simply press the button again and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> I feel the 4100 will be phased out soon replaced by new models, I&#x27;m sure the new models are better but the old one is still miles above what anything else can do!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this specific product to anyone looking to switch to an electric toothbrush - while I have not spent much time researching other models, this one seems to be one of the more reasonably priced (for what you get) and delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li> However, the cadmium in NiCads is highly toxic and not exactly the most environmentally friendly option for batteries.  </li>
            <li> It has lost some of its former power, even at full charge, then when I bought it new but still works fine.</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth aren&#x27;t straight and flossing was always a nightmare; now I just brush first and flossing&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SONICARE for a long time and love it.</li>
            <li> (In fact, he and his wife have been using this for a long time and they are 100 % satisfied).</li>
            <li> In fact, when the battery died in my first one, I really missed it</li>
            <li> We really like these soniccare products, but replaced the first one because it quit working after 4 years, whic isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all, we only get one set of adult teeth, so keeping them healthy is well worth the cost of the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It gives a good cleaning over back and flat surface of the teeth too...</li>
            <li> After charging full when we got this product, it runs seamlessly for about 1-1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better.  </li>
            <li> No dental professional will tell you this, but it true for me.</li>
            <li> My advice --- get the one that gives you this helpful little signal AND check your electrical supply before you replace a perfectly good (SEVEN year old!) appliance!</li>
            <li> It works great and the charge lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s not very portable and again, the bacteria issue is something that needs to be resolved.</li>
            <li> Since I started to use the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush just over a year ago, my gums have never again bled while brushing my teeth (as they once periodically did), my teeth are whiter and my dentist &amp; dental hygienist have been very pleased with the vast improvements in my personal dental health that have resulted.  </li>
            <li> She revised her initial diagnosis and said I was OK to resume a normal checkup/cleaning schedule every six months.  </li>
            <li> The brushes easily screw on and off the unit and can be placed in a stand until the next use.  </li>
            <li> The entire product is compact and can easily be packed for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy with a regular toothbrush to shortcut the brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have loved my sonicare brush however they are very expensive to own.</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t be buying another Philips.</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for the old one I had for some 10 years and the new one works even better than the old one when it was new!!</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it only cost about $10/year to have fantastic oral care.</li>
            <li> The new 4100 is exactly as good as my earlier 4100 except that I was unaware that it comes either with or without the feature to let you know when each 30 seconds of the 2 minute cycle is up.  </li>
            <li> It really is much better than a regular old electric!</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommends throwing out regular toothbrushes and using only the Sonicare for better protection of teeth and gums!   </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very high quality, the built-in timer is helpful, and I recommend it.  </li>
            <li> but I am on my 2nd or maybe 3rd, can&#x27;t remember for sure, but they are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Compared to manual it leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner.</li>
            <li> and I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li> really.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out $150 for the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Get the Sonicare Power Toothbrush and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!n to a different section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for giving a bargin in a time when its needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much stronger, yet surprisingly gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> Still I apprecite the quality and how much cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s important to keep my gums and teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li> T has really improved my teeth and my visits to the dentist.    </li>
            <li> but I really was impressed.)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> as usual, I&#x27;m very pleased with how it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> While this brush does not have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive models do, it is a great, simple item that does its job well.</li>
            <li> I can also really see that my gums are healthier.  </li>
            <li> This is my forth Sonicare toothbrush, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush,</li>
            <li> It works really well if you have any sort of dental work like permanent retainers, braces, etc.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> It Cleans the teeth really well.</li>
            <li> However, it only takes a couple of brushings before it feels completely comfortable.</li>
            <li> Since the battery is non-replaceable, the whole thing has to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> the machine turns off after its allocated 2 minutes of brushing, does it really also need sub-timed sequences for each quadrant of the mouth?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to rinse with it for the whole 60 seconds</li>
            <li> They have really made a difference in my gum health.</li>
            <li> like the idea that this unit does not need much charging.</li>
            <li> Feels like your holding a real tool while your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads on that newer design are harder to change than the ones on the 4100, and it takes up more room on the counter.  </li>
            <li> some getting used to, but if you are a coffee drinker you will really see the difference in the whiteness of your teeth.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommeded this item and it works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, dentist grade</li>
            <li> No breakdowns whatsoever and the price is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li> However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  </li>
            <li> but they were very pricey.  </li>
            <li> This item keeps the kids brushing really well.  </li>
            <li> I could immediately tell that this tooth brush was for real.  </li>
            <li> Sonic uses a gentle massage</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not and I am about to tick a box promising that.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was glad to fiind it as the local stores had more expensive replacements with more stuff than I needed.</li>
            <li> It arrived in very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> so you could gauge how much time to spend in each section of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recomment this product!  </li>
            <li> This one, however, doesn&#x27;t have 2 important features:  the 30-second interval indicator so that you can cover all 4 quadrants of your teeth; and and low battery indicator.  </li>
            <li> It really works, belive it or not.  </li>
            <li> They delete the charger, probably built it much cheaper</li>
            <li> Because the product does do what it is supposed to do, and it does it reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Problem is the replacement heads cost almost as much as the unit.  </li>
            <li> 31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Most people will be surprised how short it is.  </li>
            <li> I wore the old one out after 6 or so years and was glad to find another of the same.</li>
            <li> Have used this style product for years, junked my old one which was not bad at all for the new 9500 series.  </li>
            <li> At the cost that they are, that is pretty pricey plus &gt;$10 per new head.</li>
            <li> I offered to pay for shipping and cost of the batteries, but they advised that they don&#x27;t provide that service, but would be willing to sell me a new one at a discount.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers say, it&#x27;s a good idea not to charge after every use and instead only when depleted (NiCd battery).  </li>
            <li> The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Wanted the same excellent product, obviously one changes the brushes regularly, but the electric part lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> In the very beginning I did not like it, but quickly got so used to it, that I just do not feel my teeth are really clean when I use a conventional toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> The original one came with that feature, and I didn&#x27;t even know they now have it as an extra option.  </li>
            <li> This equates to about 56 minutes of total run time, which means that the original batteries installed in the Sonicare were ~600 mah.  </li>
            <li> There are, however, lots of other features which make the Elite a  better brush.  </li>
            <li> This model is inexpensive and very similar to our original model, but I miss the quadrapace feature.  </li>
            <li> Give or take a couple features, they all clean teeth equally well.</li>
            <li> My teeth looked better, I had a lot less plaque build-up, and my gums were pink and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The clean feeling after brushing can only be matched by when you walk out of the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> This makes sure you are brushing for at least two full minutes.  </li>
            <li> my teeth simply don&#x27;t feel clean like they do when I use my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> However, for someone with a normal to large orifice, this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacement for the brush heads are easy to find in almost any major general store.</li>
            <li> Amazon has never let me down on their prices, products, or their fast, sometimes FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended by my Dentist and has performed very well.</li>
            <li> think the only good thing about it is that it stimulates your gums really well because of the vibration, but unfortunately a toothbrush needs to do more than just that.</li>
            <li> Yes, a cheapo tooth brush will get the job done if you are diligent have a proper brushing technique but with the sonic I clean for a full two minutes get all the teeth inside and outside plus cleaning the tongue surface.</li>
            <li> The next time my dad went for his usual cleaning, the dentist was amazed at how clean and nice looking his teeth were.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous unit with more bells and whistles but costs twice as much to replace.</li>
            <li> It especially helps older people clean between their teeth and end that</li>
            <li> pros: gets your teeth super clean, use less toothpaste    </li>
            <li> My 23 year old daughter had her first two cavities in her life.</li>
            <li> The first time I used my old Sonicare</li>
            <li> but i think overall this is a sweet cleaner....</li>
            <li> Before I purchased my first Sonicare, I had been diagnosed as being in the early stages of peridontal disease and my dentist recommended I try one.  </li>
            <li> I saw this one on Amazon, which is exactly like my old one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I can still recommend this Advance 4100 unit, even though I won&#x27;t be surprised if it dies even quicker than the first one.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I can still recommend this Advance 4100 unit, even though I won&#x27;t be surprised if it dies even quicker than the first one.</li>
            <li> It all comes down to if you want that 30-second prompt, paying up to 20 more bucks or not.</li>
            <li> But, for $40, I got a sealed brand new toothbrush, charging station, and an additional brush head(I had just purchased 2 replacement heads)!</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner and the backs of the teeth, which is hard to get clean the old way, are better.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I seem to go through more of them with this model than the previous two.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the older one&#x27;s model number</li>
            <li> I tried to screw it back in and noticed a crack up the side of the battery housing and a larger crack around the top.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a newbie to Sonicare, you should know that the Sonicare Advance 4100 Power Toothbrush is an older model.</li>
            <li> I like this older model</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is more noisy than former models, and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to the different wave form of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> This particular toothbrush has everything you need.</li>
            <li> The sonicare advance 4100 power toothbrush was purchased as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li> It does shut off after 2 minutes but the 30 second timer is only in more costlier models.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this product daily for more than 10 years...and the unit was placed back into the charger after each and every use!!!</li>
            <li> Stick with the classic.</li>
            <li> I get better dental checkups using Sonicare twice a day than I did when I used it only once a day and flossed daily.)</li>
            <li> The main unit comes with a charger/stand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it matters which particular model of the Sonicare you get.  </li>
            <li> main two things that take adjusting are the wider handle and the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> I had one of the older Sonicare Advance models before the Elite came out.  </li>
            <li> I find the brushes last for well over 3 months for me and tend to replace them only after 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li> While it is a bit pricey for replacement heads, it is a decent trade off for the dental health it provides.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I had my first cavities filled in two decades last year, and that wasn&#x27;t inexpensive (or fun) either.</li>
            <li> Whenever I run my tongue across the surfaces of my teeth after every brushing, it always gives me great satisfaction to feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist - no more gritty tooth surfaces resulting from the buildup of plaque and/or tartar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush, I can really tell a difference when I rub my tongue against my teeth and gums, wow!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this toothbrush, I could see an instant change in the appearance of my teeth and gumline.</li>
            <li> Just hope this lasts as long as the original one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anybody, the Sonicare does all the work....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> crest electric(battery powered) brushes seem like kids stuff compared to the high rpm&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the sonicare, whichever you choose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this brush for cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare has been highly recommended by our dentist (and also by our family orthodontist for our children.)  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li> I also wish that the device could be powered by eneloops or other rechargeables--it would reduce the waste of a used unit a great deal.</li>
            <li> I look forward to clean teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li> No manufacturer will EVER tell you that little tidbit for reasons I&#x27;m sure you can figure out yourself.</li>
            <li> Compared to NiCads, Nickel Metals would be a better environmental choice but would provide little performance benefit.      </li>
            <li> You have to get used to the sensation, and it ramps up a little more each time in the beginning.</li>
            <li> As long as it has the sonic action it will work fine.....</li>
            <li> I have had 2 Sonicare brushes which did a great job, but they failed after about 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> Great product, altho replacement heads tend to be expensive</li>
            <li> Thanks for keeping this one alive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will last just as long.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you wind up with toothpaste decorating your bathroom mirror, your clothes, and pretty much the entire area around your bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the 4 series still offers the 30 second pause function, and if it doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know that I would have paid more than $20 extra for the function to get one of the newer series.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, can you think of the last time you brushed your teeth with a regular toothbrush for 2 minutes at one time?  </li>
            <li> did follow all precautions for taking care of the NiCd battery by draining all charges before recharging which is normally once a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> this was a replacement sonscare toothbrush - it performs very well - after tis first charge i have brushed 20 times and its still going</li>
            <li> First off, the Sonicare absolutely helps enormously with keeping tartar at bay.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush for anyone in the market for new one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this model does not have the 30 second pacer, which I really loved with my original one.  </li>
            <li> Since you can turn the Sonicare right back on again, this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Far superior to the newer Sonicare series, which have brushes too small for a normal sized male mouth.</li>
            <li> The other ones are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Based on this new information, instead of the original 5 star rating that I gave Sonicare, I now give Sonicare a 2 star rating since I do not believe that the value for the dollar spent is there.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about 10 years, and when I bought this new one, I just assumed it would have the quad-pacer that lets you know when 30 seconds is up</li>
            <li> Now I know I could have just bought a new battery unit.</li>
            <li> new unit (after two months) is working well, does the customary job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oral B user forever; I&#x27;ve now found the \\&quot;new way.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have the entry level sonicare, and have been using it for 2 years nonstop, and change the heads every 6-8 months, and still works like new when fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to buy new heads at the six month mark, so</li>
            <li> My Mom has used both the 4100 and now has a new Essence.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that Sonicare does not replace batteries, therefore you have to purchase a completely new item.  </li>
            <li> The new one,    </li>
            <li> would either unwillingly buy a new one or find a competing product whith replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> A new Essence model in on the way from Amazon as the Advance appears to be phased out of the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one i did copay on it</li>
            <li> I got some new brushheads for it, charged it up</li>
            <li> Mine is like brand new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They were bought out by Philips and if you read the box on the new brushes you&#x27;ll see its a Philips Elec.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem these things have is that bases die eventually, and then you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;new&#x27; models.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so they can claim a new &#x27;slant head&#x27; innovation.</li>
            <li> To try to get you to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something easy to remember when your half awake and brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li> , feels like the newer versions don&#x27;t really add much in the way of actual tooth-cleaning functionality.  </li>
            <li> The thing I DO NOT LIKE about this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t let me know every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to another part of my mouth (like my old one does).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently at all, and so far it has proven to be very durable-</li>
            <li> The older 4100 has a lot more crevices (holding bacteria) and is a lot thicker (making it more difficult to reach the back of the mouth) than the newer models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would very much recommend this or similar Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll read the product features more carefully before ordering!</li>
            <li> I only wish that this model had the 30 second intervals like the original model I purchased over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am on my second one after the first</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this exact item.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ticklish from the toothbrush they use in dentists&#x27; offices, you&#x27;ll have the same problem at first from this one.  </li>
            <li> I cannot compare this product with others (since is the first and only one I have used)</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these that I have had, the first on lasted about 8-10 years.</li>
            <li> I have since purchaser extra heads for ours and bought one for each of our married daughters and their husbands.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the same exact one again.</li>
            <li> I am not a \\&quot;flosser\\&quot;, and the first time I went to have my teeth cleaned after using the toothbrush for several months, they were amazed at the lack of placque on my teeth!  </li>
            <li> so it would die even sooner, dropped the price somewhat and likely get an even higher profit margin.</li>
            <li> I will buy the cheapest model I can find since I know it will clean my teeth as well or better than an expensive model.</li>
            <li> While I am pleased with the overall performance, I don&#x27;t especially like the fact that this model has a short battery life, necessitating complete replacement every two years.  </li>
            <li> Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li> New one works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> I had just bought new brushes for our old one</li>
            <li> My old one has this feature, the new one does not.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new Sonicare toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare that gave up the ghost after 11 years.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare because the battery died in the first one which was about 3 years old.  </li>
            <li> so you know how long to brush the top, front and back, and the bottom row, front and back.  </li>
            <li> This is my second brand of electric toothbrush, and is much better for my mouth than the previous brand.</li>
            <li> And they have brought down the price from the original $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fanatic about keeping clean teeth and at my last checkup didn&#x27;t even have to have a cleaning as there was no plaque or tartar to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I entirely buy their claims about whitening and such, but it does a decent job of keeping my teeth clean in-between regular dental cleanings.</li>
            <li> If you floss and use this toothbrush twice daily you will certainly be doing your \\&quot;homework\\&quot; as far as oral hygiene is concerned.</li>
            <li> When it died after about a year and a half I got a Braun, the original model.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky at the handle, but it has a nice smaller brush head (since I have a smaller mouth</li>
            <li> It is several years old and still brushing very well, neither of us having any complaints.  </li>
            <li> For some time now I&#x27;ve spent a fortune buying cheap imitations thinking it&#x27;s the same as a pricier toothbrush the likes of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Just like the old one, this one runs for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Advance 4100 used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and they aren&#x27;t as sensitive,  </li>
            <li> and i am 50 years old, so</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my old sonicare toothbrush, since I had unused brush heads which do not fit the newer models available in stores near me.  </li>
            <li> We had an old Sonic Care toothbrush that looks like this but had the Quad Pacer.</li>
            <li> It must have been 7 or 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an old Sonic that I used for over 6 years until the battery would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> : it has no &#x27;Quadpacer&#x27; (as did my old unit)</li>
            <li> The only real downside, I do have to add is</li>
            <li> Old Sonicare 4100 lasted 7 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Sonicare that was 5 years old.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare beeped every 30 seconds to remind me to switch brushing areas.</li>
            <li> Ours were about 5 or 6 yrs old ...</li>
            <li> s is about 7 yrs old...</li>
            <li> Works with old charger and brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the basic model, but that&#x27;s really all you need.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and thorough at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have tried the  \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> But it does have one flaw that I am surprised that Sonicare has not address yet.</li>
            <li> It felt a bit strange using it the first time, just as it says in the instructions.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare helped save my adult teeth, and for that I give it my highest recommendation.e</li>
            <li> My only quibbles are really advocacy items:</li>
            <li> so while it doesn&#x27;t provide a spinning motion for brushing, it does vibrate and help you brush near the gums without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the next time the brush was used, it didn&#x27;t seem to be vibrating much.</li>
            <li> As far as the vibration when you start using it may take a week to get use to it and yes close your mouth</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the battery lasted.</li>
            <li> Now we have a his and a hers, much to our total satifaction.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my old Sonicare (which lasted about 7 yrs, by the way).  </li>
            <li> I gave this one a five star rating based on the lifespan of my old one.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Takes the guess work on cleaning by automatic shut off feature when brushing is complete.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling like a professional job was done in cleaning my teeth every time.</li>
            <li> Sure it sucks that the battery can&#x27;t be replaced</li>
            <li> Thus far, my brush has always lasted that length of time.  </li>
            <li> nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace an 8 year old Sonicare Advance.  </li>
            <li> I had assumed it would last much longer.</li>
            <li> had the old Advance 4100 model here (and almost no one else did) for $45</li>
            <li> Realize that you can only make but so much money selling a toothbrush (or a can of dog food or a cigarette lighter or whatever)  ... and that if management turns it into a piece of c**p through cost-cutting, well, people will stop buying it altogether.</li>

            <li> My 15 year old Sonicare toothbrush just died.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money to step up to the next model for me....</li>
            <li> Initially, the sensation was one of \\&quot;ticklling\\&quot; but after a few uses it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you can afford a few more dollars, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite model.  </li>
            <li> However, the price was right compared to the newer more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Finally I searched on Amazon and found one at the right price (finally cheaper after 4 years) and bought it!   </li>
            <li> The only other difference that I noticed is that the button light does not blink while charging and stop when finished.</li>
            <li> Recently, I finally replaced a very old unit with new one (Model 4100), which I purchased from Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the expected lifetime of the battery is 5 years or more, the NiCD have a &#x27;memory effect&#x27; and to get rid of it you have to run the brush down to near zero power.  </li>
            <li> There are a few issues with the fact that even if I clean the inside of the toothbrush head, it still collects bacteria there and this seems to be an issue of design of the product.  </li>
            <li> When it does I will seriously consider the cost difference before dropping a lot more money when this one has served me so well.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second one after the first one finally wore out.</li>
            <li> So when I finally graduated and got a decent job with health benefits, I figured it was time to schedule an appointment.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted almost 3 years after daily use by 3 different people.  </li>
            <li> It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li> but my dentist recommended I start using the older Advance model because it has a larger and deeper penetrating head.</li>
            <li> The Advance 4100 lets you know when you have brushed 2 minutes although it doesn&#x27;t do the 30 second beeps like our first one.  </li>
            <li> This is the second unit I have purchased, the first lasting about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does the same job as my older model.</li>
            <li> (Sure hope those few pennies saved make up for the LONG time customers you are going to lose.)</li>
            <li> With my vast improvement in dental health and whiter teeth, I give a resounding 5 out of 5 star rating to the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush and highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush   Highly recommended, have used one for the last five years.  </li>
            <li> No cavities in 6 years with noticeably cleaner teeth even with a high daily coffee intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all cases, the areas between the teeth need regular attention, ie floss, go-betweens, proxybrushes, stimulators, or other effective tools which stimulate the gums and break down bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to buy a new one as the old one was beginning to show signs of wear.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a new one now is the batteries died on the old one....</li>
            <li> Replaced old 4100 with new one BUT they neglect to say that this model no longer has the 30 second timer.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare finally crapped out and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush works fine, except it does not do the little pause every 30 seconds (as advertised and last one did) to let one know when he is nearing the 2 minute shut-off.  </li>
            <li> Consequently, use of a regular toothbrush simply cannot provide as much cleansing action as the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is probably not a good idea for most of us to use toothpastes with silica \\&quot;whiteners\\&quot; with a brush like this -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put mine back on the charger after everytime I use it, so at the end of two weeks, the battery is kind of weak.  </li>
            <li> The handle is several times thicker than a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I now get 10 seconds of brushing out of the handle and have gone back to normal toothbrushing until I decide which electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I also remove the entire head, clean it out, then wipe it down with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> If you could replace the two AA batteries in the Sonicare without a big hassle,  you would probably never have to buy a new one again.....</li>
            <li> We ordered a new Sonicare to replace the one that had given us over five years of daily use by two adults.  </li>
            <li> it worked VERY well for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using my Sonicare brush my gums have improved 100% and my smile is wide and white.</li>
            <li> When I went back three months later, she was amazed at how much my oral health had improved.  </li>
            <li> If you take steps (i.e. using tape for waterproofing to supplement for poor construction and completely drying the unit off and charger off after every use) you may be able to get a longer life out of it.  </li>
            <li> The first 2-3 days are needed to get used to the action of the brushing and my gums got a little sensitive as a result.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll not go back to the old brush again!</li>
            <li> My sister originally recommended the 4 series to me (in 1999) because she had to have skin grafts because of excessive brushing, which I also tend to do.  </li>
            <li> This is a major pain as the battery itself takes up 24 hours to fully recharge each time.</li>
            <li> And in the rare case I have gotten stuck away from home unexpectedly and had to use a plain toothbrush</li>
            <li> since converted to the e-series AA battery model which is now going past 5 years, and its battery is strong and reliable, because I can replace it myself and it needs to be recharged only every 3-4 months using eneloop</li>
            <li> even if it is a little pricey, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Messy to use when mouth is open to clean front teeth etc.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and you could  buy a hundred decent regular toothbrushes in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   </li>
            <li> a day brushing compared to nearly a week when new, mainly because even if powered to &#x27;near&#x27; zero you can&#x27;t really deep discharge these batteries without unmounting it, which means destroying the handle.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth, in general, feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li> There is supposed to be a fraction of a second stop action built into the product.</li>
            <li> I am a mature male with siblings fighting gum disease--not me.  </li>
            <li> Philips has apparently decided to boost the sales of their E-Series Replacement Bush Heads by tapping into the market for owners of the Philips Sonicare Advance 4100.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and the sensitivity is starting to diminish.  </li>
            <li> I had the old sonicare for several years.  </li>
            <li> The old toothbrush charger charges this, so we only need one charger out.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this design feature is to avoid over brushing.  </li>
            <li> far outways its competitors especially for helping to stabilize periodontal disease in conjunction with a 2-4 month visit for perio maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy another one, old style because I have xtra brush ehads already, but I will definitely continue with the sonicare...</li>
            <li> If fact, I went on a trip and used my old electirc toothbrush, and I felt as if I hadn&#x27;t even brushed.</li>
            <li> In the early years, I actually had forgotten to charge it and did make 2 weeks on one charge.</li>
            <li> if there is a low battery reminder beep like my old one yet.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your wide variety of products that can be ordered from your site.</li>
            <li> Over the last ten-fifteen years, every dental professional I knew preferred Sonicare over \\&quot;Aural-B.\\</li>
            <li> good to verify that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the batteries dying...</li>
            <li> If I take the cynical view, it&#x27;s good for sonicare yo</li>
            <li> The angle of the brush makes it kind of hard to brush without making a mess.   </li>
            <li> because they are very rough and noisy whereas the 4100 is very gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t notice it missing right away</li>
            <li> The main patient complaint I have gotten is that the brush is too vigorous for them, but those complaints are few compared to those who are pleased.  </li>
            <li> In terms of features, the three newer models are ranked low to high respectively with Essence at the low end.     </li>
            <li> The only negative is the sound, it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> brush is advertised as having four (4) 30 second stages (two minutes total) in the brushing action</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge back to normal though, about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> After using my first Sonicare for the past 6 years and having no problems at all, it was quite natural that I would be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li> It works well when used properly ask your dentist or hygenist you will be surprised on the basic tips that can save you time in the chair.</li>
            <li> This is my second model, as the battery finally quite in the old model after 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> And since Sonicare is clearly establishing a pattern of going on the cheap and cheaper, inventing new models to obsolete the old models, and doing whatever they can to get you to keep buying new toothbrushes, I can only figure that when this new one eventually shuts down, whatever Sonicare has on the market then will be little more than worthless c**p.</li>

            <li> I just bought a new brush head over the weekend and they&#x27;re up to $20 now for a single and $30 for a pair.(2 October, 2006)</li>
            <li> I am now using a stopwatch which is a little bit of a pain first thing in the morning, but</li>
            <li> The more expensive models do have more features, but the basic model cleans just as well for less than half the price of the top-of-line model.  </li>
            <li> On my first purchase  I noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they are  supposed to last, cracked in less than 3 months.    </li>
            <li> The only thing missing on the Advance 4100 that was on the older model is that the Advance 4100 runs for a continuous, uninterrupted two minutes while the older model beeped every 30 seconds during a two-minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> It cost half than what the other brands charge (I had gotten it on sale here for $40) and it leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> You dont need to waste a lot of toothpaste for this as this fast action brush creates enough foam for cleaning.</li>
            <li> My old one quit after 8 long years.  </li>
            <li> and then discovering that the &#x27;trusted&#x27; company decided to make a few pennies more per item and killed the 30 second timer on &#x27;low-end&#x27; items.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the brush head is kinda large, the bristles a little too soft for my taste, and the shaft is short so it can be to clean my back teeth</li>
            <li> My other only complaint (OK, I guess I have two) is that Sonicare turns off after about two minutes, the time it has determined it should take you to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist said the newer models aren&#x27;t much different, as they apparently just have different fancy timing options (which seem gimmicks to me).  </li>
            <li> I had been using an ordinary manual toothbrush, and my checkups were good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Alas, it has a built it timer, so can&#x27;t just leave it on so it will run down on its own.  </li>
            <li> Amazon also offers competitive pricing on the single replacement brushes, so you don&#x27;t need to leave home to search when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I let it die and recharged, I left it on the charger, i tried anything and everything to get it back to at least doing a full brushing - nothing.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush was a complete waste of my money, and now I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Not that it would die in the first week, only to avoid the potential dead battery in the second week.</li>
            <li> used to the oral b toothbrush, so it took a little getting used to, but really like the way this one cleans my teeth and</li>
            <li> Use is much easier if you put a little toothpaste on your fingetip and rub it on your front teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new one and it is performing just as my other one did, and has met all my expectations.    </li>
            <li> I brush my tongue without the power because I prefer doing that very gently a couple times as opposed to the \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; done by this small appliance.  </li>
            <li> I think the 2-minute timer is both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> This is a major disappointment to me considering how much it would cost to replace the battery, and how much it costs to buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Newer, sleeker models come and go, but I&#x27;ve found that this is solid in the hand, easy to depress the single button, and I like the thicker base than many others on the market.  </li>
            <li> I really like the brush, but so far, I&#x27;ve spent over one-hundred-fifty US dollars in the past year on them</li>
            <li> My other one was 5 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old, have absolutely no problem with my teeth or gums, and I give the credit to Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time brushing my teeth long enough and with the right amount of pressure (so as to not affect the enamel and gums).</li>
            <li> If you use amex and it dies in less than 2 years for a one-year warranty and 4 years for a two-year warranty, you will be getting new ones without paying.</li>
            <li> I like that it shuts off after two minutes because I know I&#x27;ve brushed long enough.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this one will last that long, or that yours will, but even if it was only a fluke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to my routine and when I switch for the smaller size, I long for the standard size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sad because my old electric toothbrush was this model and it lasted more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> My old one quit working after 5 years, so I wanted the same model since using it cut cavities down to zero and eliminated any gum pain.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s with twice-daily use &amp; charging it ONLY after it runs down completely.</li>
            <li> Every bad review I&#x27;ve read for the Sonicare 4100 seems to be about the battery life lasting only 1 year (or the hilarious one about the root canal!).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped in my first one.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product, too bad the brushes cost almost half the cost of the product and there is no replacement battery.</li>
            <li> This gets your teeth from-the-dentist clean, seriously!    </li>
            <li> It is fast but small movement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact model for at least 8 years and have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure this thing really worked or just made me</li>
            <li> I kind of expected the same disappointment with the Sonicare</li>
            <li> We have another Sonicare model that uses the small replacement heads that cost 1/3rd as much.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for how long the charge lasts as I have left it on the charging stand when not in use.  </li>
            <li> the brush head itself seems to last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I always turn it back on and finish up, but I know how long it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> Long story made short...</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> in fact I had a route I walked my house so as to brush long enough turns out</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d suggest that you time yourself to see how long you actually brush for.  </li>
            <li> The timer on the brush assures I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> When fully charged, the toothbrush has approximately a dozen uses or almost a week&#x27;s worth prior to recharging, convenient for a short trip w/o carrying along the charger.</li>
            <li> The secret is to use it often and for the full two minutes to get maximum benefits in oral hygene.</li>
            <li> Only problem, one of the tiny magnets on the end of the brush came loose somehow and stuck to our sink fixture.</li>
            <li> Hope it will last a long time for the price paid!</li>
            <li> No major complaints.</li>
            <li> This new one is really messy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do NOT leave the handle out of the charger very long because the charge does not come back.  </li>
            <li> Dry it with a towel after use, place it back on the charger stand.</li>
            <li> We really loved the heft of the base unit and the 30 second beeps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless of the two-year limited warranty the last one lasted me over eight years.  </li>
            <li> My teeth would bleed every single time I brushed them.</li>
            <li> I have recently bought my second one after having my first one for approximately 7 years.</li>
            <li> I will definitely stick with this brand since I&#x27;ve had other auto toothbrushes that did not do the job and totally conked out sooner.  </li>
            <li> The main improvement appears to be redesigning the base so that it drains and dries better detering mildew, etc.</li>
            <li> The first was purchased in late 1999 and had finally developed a small crack in the frame.  </li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> long before Philips acquired the Seattle-based company</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Advance works just as well as the Sonicare Elite so long as you use the E-Series Brush Heads on the Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the heads cracked and did not last even remotely close to the   6 months</li>
            <li> The teeth look shining for a long time.</li>
            <li> To my delight, I noted that the batteries employed by the unit were two standard, albeit unbranded AA NiCad cells.  </li>
            <li> And I can travel with it and stays charged for a long weekend.</li>
            <li> (I think one of the higher-end models does this), but otherwise the battery lasts as long as the company says it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the advice of reviewers who report long product life</li>
            <li> Apparently, however, the Sonicare is designed to hold a charge for quite a few hours, to allow you to take it with you while traveling, for instance, without having to bring the entire charging stand along.</li>
            <li> but I am a bit annoyed that I recieved a defective product, and I wonder if my situation is rare or happens often.</li>
            <li> when this new one dies and all the old stock of the Advance 4100 model is gone, I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying the one with the flimsy thin slanted head.</li>
            <li> To my horror, the dentist said that my teeth were a mess, and that I needed to have immediate deep cleaning, with further work and checkups done every three months.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it had the 30 second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; as the other one did.</li>
            <li> My other one lastest for 10 yrs., until it would finally decide to turn on by itself.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any techical problems with it, and for the price, the entry level sonicare gets the job done without having to spend the extra money on the quadrapace timer, or the thinner heads on the other model.  </li>
            <li> Couple of things to keep in mind, it is (like any power toothbrushes) a little messier than a manual toothbrush especially when reaching the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Mine develop tiny cracks that then spread like a car windshield due to the vibration, resulting in the brush falling apart (and no, I didn&#x27;t drop them).  </li>
            <li> and it has worked extremely well now for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is totally different than other brands i have used.</li>
            <li> the other hand, the device was solidly built and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> While one reviewer may not need the timer, and the other feels that 2 minutes is too short</li>
            <li> Other brushings I use a regular toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> toothpaste can dry in crevices, so it must be cleaned,</li>
            <li> Keep it where it will stay dry.</li>
            <li> But after a few short months of owning it, I can&#x27;t get it to charge anymore, and the entire casing is cracked up the front of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When my last Sonicare died and I went for a few weeks using a standard toothbrush (because I was price shopping), my gums got sore!</li>
            <li> The charger base of my old one broke during an oversea trip, after more than two years of use.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this visit, eight years earlier, my former dentist had recommended getting the Sonicare, because I was developing receding gums (from brushing too hard) and had some minor gingivitis and plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> We think it is the NiCad batteries which have limited life and always develop a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just buy the single bursh, buy the family set.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic on the back of the brush hits your teeth and is not very comfortable.    </li>
            <li> I is the same as the old one except the charging base is a little better.     </li>
            <li> The only usage issue I had was learning to let the brush do the work instead of pressing it down.  </li>
            <li> While I do floss, it is not on a daily basis, but this tooth brush kept plague down even between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare 4 series paused slightly every 30 seconds as an alert to change from upper to lower, and also front to behind.  </li>
            <li> remember, before you plop down $150 for one with a slew of worthless add-ons that you probably don&#x27;t need, remember the company can make the same thing and sell it all day long for $30 and still turn a tidy profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like any other electronic products, its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program.</li>
            <li> Previous (similar) model lasted close to five years without any problems.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t have a lot of teeth left, so the quadpacer would be of less value to him; I&#x27;ve given this one to him hoping to help him salvage the ones he still has, and I&#x27;m using my even newer e7300 (separate review).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t want a different model because of the longevity of my first one.  </li>
            <li> I typically get about 12 days between charges, so I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of charging it on the 10th and 20th of the month.  </li>
            <li> I later noted that my Sonicare had just turned three and had undergone less than 100 charge cycles.  </li>
            <li> I instantly noticed my teeth being less \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; after using this it.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting my next appointment to see if my pockets have gotten smaller.</li>
            <li> Take the tooth brush and leave the cannoli - oops, I mean the base, and enjoy clean teeth where ever you go.</li>
            <li> They had one before, one still worked but the other died long ago.</li>
            <li> They really need replaced every 6 months (at least!).  </li>
            <li> Lasted only a little over 7 years.</li>
            <li> Finally, just a little dab of toothpaste does the job.  </li>
            <li> One big thing I noticed Is I floss after brushing and there would always be some little somthing that the floss caught.</li>
            <li> And the backing on it tends to trap stuff in it (such as lip balm, if you happen to be wearing it when brushing your teeth), which is very difficult to clean out.  </li>
            <li> That, along with toothpaste for sensitive teeth, helped ease the discomfort I was feeling after inadvertently brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> the one complaint is that it is loud.  </li>
            <li> The brush strokes are not nearly as fast as the sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> All the bells and whistles are just fluff ......</li>
            <li> Several times after using the toothbrush, I have tried to floss and its a waste of time because there is nothing to floss.  </li>
            <li> Even contacting their website and clicking on their e-mail icon only provides a dead link.  </li>
            <li> this one however was missing the 30 second beep</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve realized that the battery in the brush is so charged that there&#x27;s really no need to plug it in on my trips to Europe.</li>
            <li> Still a bit expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for a few years, this is my second one.</li>
            <li> SPENT.  </li>
            <li> I do not like to buy the replacement heads because they are so expensive, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Replacements are expensive but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I removed and replaced them with two 600mah Sanyo cells, closed the handle and sealed it shut with silicone.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because the 30 sec timer does not work.</li>
            <li> We were told how to remove the double AA batteries, but the unit is designed so you destroy it in the process.</li>
            <li> and they work as expected.</li>
            <li> NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS PROCDUCT</li>
            <li> That was a minor disappointment as I thought I was buying exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> To keep from splattering while brushing it&#x27;s recommended to keep your mouth closed around this brush.</li>
            <li> For the extra $100 you got several nearly worthless features (beeping reminders, a cheap plastic travel case).</li>
            <li> Only issue I have with it is that the base gets destroyed if I take it to Europe (using my top quality adaptor.)</li>
            <li> For someone who always had at least one cavity or some other type of dental problem at checkups, and to only have had one in the last 10 years, I am sold on my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> The genius management will have probably taken the $30 model down to a $10 disposable version that only vibrates about half the time and dies within a month.</li>
            <li> The genius management will have probably taken the $30 model down to a $10 disposable version that only vibrates about half the time and dies within a month.</li>
            <li> (I think my mouth is a little smaller than average too</li>
            <li> The main ineffectiveness of the brush has NOT to do with the brush, but with its inconsistant use, or poor technique by its user.  </li>
            <li> My last one lasted a little less than 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The power button can be a little hard for children to press, but this could be a good OR bad thing.</li>
            <li> When I get my teeth cleaned at the Dentist he has very little to do and tells me that the regular brushing has helped close up pockets in the bone between my teeth...</li>
            <li> I agree with a few of the previous reviews that it works well, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other power brushes but compared to manual, well, their is no comparison.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the brush has done wonders for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other brands, but I (and my dentist) think my teeth  feel and look cleaner using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because I have a small mouth and the back of the brush</li>
            <li> After my dentist recommended against using the whitening toothpastes, due to their abrasiveness to gums, I thought I was going to be stuck with healthier gums but stained teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen on the other reviews that others have had ones that have died ...</li>
            <li> It has a ni-cad battery, and due to the way the unit is sealed, it cannot be replaced.</li>
            <li> I still consider this to be a fairly small investment for my dental future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lazy man&#x27;s key to tooth care.</li>
            <li> I am bit lazy to brush twice a day with the manual brush and I have already had enough fillings in my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get this eletric toothbrush due to a receding gumline.  </li>
            <li> I have taken mine on several vacations over the past two years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with losing the charge.  </li>
            <li> Our other one just gave up the ghost after 8 years of use by my wife and myself.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself to be enough of a minimalist that the idea of an electric toothbrush seemed excessive to me.  </li>
            <li> I had some build-up and discoloration due to wearing braces.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement due to battery power loss over 5 or 6 years.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles of other brushes but for the price you can&#x27;t miss.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after hearing other people&#x27;s recommendations and TV ads.  </li>
            <li> and then the sharp plastic cut my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than the other ones.</li>
            <li> I wouln&#x27;t use any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We have tried other power toothbrushes but they don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> The other lost all battery life within two years.</li>
            <li> Other than the battery problem</li>
            <li> Then once they are addicted, they will buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> I hardly had to sit for my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for my next dental check up.</li>
            <li> only complaint has been getting used to brushing with an electric toothbrush--a problem I suspect I would have with ANY electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My last version of this brush lasted at least 5 years and was trouble-free.</li>
            <li> --sucks when i&#x27;m in the middle of brushing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain it&#x27;s longevity; it simply goes against common rechargeable battery protocol.  </li>
            <li> It was more annoying than helpful for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush to replace my six or seven year old Sonicare which I thought was broken (it turns out I just had a faulty outlet in my bathroom).  </li>
            <li> While the Elite also requires cleaning, it seems that the seal that separates the base of the head from the arm holding the bristles seals much better.</li>
            <li> I talked to Phillips Cust Support for Sonicare in Stamford CT on 8.29.06 after the 2nd failure and was told average battery life is 3-5 yrs</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a warning to let you know when the power was running down</li>
            <li> My other one lasted 7 years!  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I would say about the product is that there is no way you can find out if the battery is almost out, unless you keep track of how much it&#x27;s used before it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have things like battery indicator levels, and doesn&#x27;t buzz every 30 seconds like my previous one did making my timing off.  </li>
            <li> The price was thirty percent less than Walmart&#x27;s (plus I paid no sales tax), and the delivery was swift.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this or Braun and since I had previously owned a Braun, I decided to switch.</li>
            <li> Whiter, cleaner teeth with out whitening chemicals and less stressful cleanings at the dentist  </li>
            <li> The only negative I&#x27;ve run across is that this is one seriously messy process.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads slightly pricey, but look for sales.</li>
            <li> the handle cracked within 3 months, and lasted less than a year.    </li>
            <li> This at half the price and does the job.</li>
            <li> The previous one worked well for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> All the more expensive versions offer is needless beeps and ways to let you know when 30 seconds are up.  </li>
            <li> Since I got one and started using it with Rembrandt toothpaste, my visits have dropped to twice a year with one half the time in the dentist chair.    </li>
            <li> My dentist notices my lack of flossing less when I use this.  </li>
            <li> It broke in less than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It works smoother than the Braun with less vibration, so there is less enamel ware.  </li>
            <li> Of course I bought it from Amazon and paid much less.</li>
            <li> , I know I have much less plaque.</li>
            <li> everytime you brush in less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I thought this electric toothbrush would have a 30-second alert like my previous Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Battery lasted less than a year, brush replacements are bulkier &amp; more complicated than need be and are too expensive</li>
            <li> My teeth stay cleaner longer throughout the day and since I have a tendency to brush too hard and too long</li>
            <li> the plastic in the product should be recyclable; the mfg used to include little stickers to remind the user when to replace the head (for the lame among us), and they no longer do; and I fear this model may be phased out in favor of others with more (needless, in my opinion) bells and whistles...</li>
            <li> Heads were small - new heads are expensive and not sure if they are bigger or not until purchase and use them.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed and didn&#x27;t buy another until a few years later.  </li>
            <li> all of them to endlessly s***w the public out of outrageous markups, multiple purchases, downsized pacakges at higher prices, and whatnot?</li>
            <li> all of them to endlessly s***w the public out of outrageous markups, multiple purchases, downsized pacakges at higher prices, and whatnot?</li>
            <li> Another longevity trick is to take teflon tape (used by plumbers) and seal tightly the hold-down cap of the brush head - this prevents water from rusting out the brush head magnets.    </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about making a little mess with toothpaste in or out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price for a new one is, frankly, absurd.</li>
            <li> The cons are that it does not clean between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Being a little slower with things, I would rather turn it off when I&#x27;M done, not when it thinks I should be done.  </li>
            <li> Keep em&#x27; with this little wonder called sonicare.  </li>
            <li> A little beep goes off every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a TIP&amp;gt;&amp;gt;I brush with the SONICARE for the two minutes, then I floss, then pour a little LISTERINE on the brush and brush again to tighten up the gums.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate them against other electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> If your dental hygienest has little to do inside your mouth when you go for a cleaning you know the brush worked.</li>
            <li> As for the people  thinking the replacement brushes are a little spendy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get that far!  </li>
            <li> an after a little research I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the brushing feel however now</li>
            <li> My teeth had so little plaque on them that I wasn&#x27;t eligible to be used as the example.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are a little pricey</li>
            <li> very hard to cut open</li>
            <li> (they were never in bad shape,) but it was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a coffee and heavy tea drinker.      </li>
            <li> Everyday it feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It splashes and can be quite messy if you run it when out of your mouth; must be turned on and off while in your mouth to avoid splashing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been trying for a few weeks now and am giving up.</li>
            <li> and I have never had any trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> Both of us say it&#x27;s like going to have your teeth cleaned by the Hygenist, without the trouble.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare that had lasted about 8 years before the power button failed.  </li>
            <li> bristles are quite firm and seem to perform quite well.  </li>
            <li> Now it is dead.</li>
            <li> We thought the unit was defective until I noticed the missing magnet.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to prevent another item from being sent to a landfill, I contacted Sonicare, told them that my batteries appeared to be dead and asked to have them replaced.  </li>
            <li> You can sometimes save a few dollars by getting them on ebay.  </li>
            <li> If you are still using a manual brush, you&#x27;re missing out and you are doing your teeth a disservice.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;d want to upgrade to one of the higher-end models, because the brush heads don&#x27;t have that plastic backing behind the brush itself.</li>
            <li> It already seems to be doing so after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> He took it apart and one of the ni-cad batteries was dead and beyond recovery.  </li>
            <li> THE LAST ONE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 14 YEARS BEFORE IT DIED.</li>
            <li> You look forward to using it everyday.</li>
            <li> replaced it after a few years because we had trouble finding replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the more expensive ones do, which can be a bit annoying if you don&#x27;t have a clock next to your sink.</li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> When choosing between the Sonicare&#x27;s, the only real difference are the zone timers which I find annoying and the grip/angle.  </li>
            <li> I have very little tartar (which saves me from that painful process), and though I had the beginning stages of gingivitis when I was younger, those have cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> Was surprised and disappointed this model does not have 30 second automatic timer to indicate when to change brushing areas.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing my 9YO Sonicare that had died, and was disappointed to find that this one lacked a feature - called \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; now - that was standard and unnamed on the old one.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my first one due to charging failure, but I figure one blowout in nine years isn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> I feel my teeth are cleaner than just using the electric $5 pulsar Oral B I had been using for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Since it was dead anyway, I took it apart (with a chisel--the case is glued together) and found the usual two AA NiCad batteries inside.  </li>
            <li> The rep did say however that they would honor the warranty for about 6mos past the expiration if it was due to battery failure before 3yrs....</li>
            <li> I also find it very loud, difficult to use, overall a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the replacement heads are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems like it wear out faster than my usual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Yeah, no more whiny DH.  </li>
            <li> The Cons are really not many or they are negligible...</li>
            <li> and they usually have a two pack on sell for under 19 dollar&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In the past year, I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> It was flattened by several cars in an unfortunate motorcycle accident (I did recover the remains).  </li>
            <li> B000LJ86G0 Sonicare Xtreme E3000 Power Toothbrush - Orange]] failed repeatedly - we actually had Amazon send us replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and was afraid of what the braces would do to my teeth, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Since we had used Sonicare for the past 5-6 years when it quit, we wanted another one.</li>
            <li> I did not keep the handle on the charger and it usually sat in the shower unless it needed charging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You know the slick feeling your teeth get just after going to a dentist for a routine cleaning every 6 months??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were disappointed with this one because it didn&#x27;t have the divided timer option: Our first one would beep every quarter of the run time</li>
            <li> That used to be an issue for me - but no more.  </li>
            <li> Ordinarily, I spend about one dollar on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in owning this first Advance 4100 (except for its untimely demise).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very messy.  </li>
            <li> However, I hadn&#x27;t had a dental checkup for quite some time due to being a poor college student.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the steps people have taken to open it, cut thru the packing and sealants to change the batteries, and then re-seal - it seems a lot of effort for something that should bloody WORK after only one year!   </li>
            <li> My husband and my daughter needed a new one badly.</li>
            <li> I hate the item for only one reason: it was so long in storage that the battery couldn&#x27;t charge fully to work effeciently.</li>
            <li> ( it&#x27;s so hard to justify a $70.00 toothbrush, and I wish I&#x27;d gotten it sooner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t push too hard on the brush.</li>
            <li> I used to brush hard and, that must have been part of the problem.</li>
            <li> Inside the box the unit is sealed in that hard molded plastic.</li>
            <li> One negative</li>
            <li> If you have bad arthritis in your hands you may have trouble getting the package open.</li>
            <li> it keeps its charge for at least a week - never tried longer than that.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I encountered was increased sensitivity to cold</li>
            <li> I bought it at Costco sometime in the late 1990s.</li>
            <li> As a side note, smaller hands find it difficult to handle and manipulate the adult sized base unit.</li>
            <li> so I was forced to buy another one...</li>
            <li> be fooled, those other electronic toothbrushes don&#x27;t come close, they just vibrate your hand till its numb and leaving your teeth not nearly as clean as with a sonicare.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it has a somewhat awkward brush head, which sometimes is a little difficult to reach small spaces.</li>
            <li> You may use this brush after a heavy food (like chicken, or other meats).</li>
            <li> For a small looking unit, this toothbrush has weight!</li>
            <li> I hate cords and have little space and would love the base to have a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> The detachable tooth brush part has cracked up so bad it barely even attaches to this toothbrush anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps hitting the opposite teeth; the buzz is quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes very little time to get used to the vibrations, and in fact if I use mine without it turned on (such as when I forget to recharge it), my teeth feel numb!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a serious plaque problem and gum issues.</li>
            <li> I think that I just have a bad product and probably should have sent it back but was leaving town for an extended vacation and did not have time.  </li>
            <li> As a daily coffee drinker, my dad would have bad coffee stains on the inside of the teeth, that the dentist would have to work at to remove.  </li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> The directions, and web site, advise--and instruct--the user on removing the batteries for recycling before disposing the dead brush, though it&#x27;s a difficult task.</li>
            <li> , it does a thorough cleaning job, however, my wife prefers the quad pacer timing on the old one, whereas I prefer this one because I found that feature annoying.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product because I tried to purchase an upgraded toothbrush but was informed it was too late for me to cancel the one I purchased even though it was not shipped and had only been purchased the day befor.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same base for my Sonicare for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant spending</li>
            <li> The toothbrush leaves a sensation in my mouth that is tough to describe.  </li>
            <li> and I was unable to change the battery because it was too hard to pry the handle apart without breaking it</li>
            <li> On the fourth morning of usage the toothbrush unscrewed from the base.</li>
            <li> With this in mind I took the least expensive unit I could find, which does not include the time feature &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I hope that the Phillips takeover hasn&#x27;t been for the worse.</li>
            <li> This is the basic item and unless you&#x27;re an idiot</li>
            <li> If you hate flossing and aren&#x27;t likely to keep up with it, this Sonicare will do the job between your teeth.</li>
            <li> and we share the same base.  </li>
            <li> Since the circuitry inside must be broken to get at the batteries, they&#x27;re not replaceable and thus it&#x27;s basically a disposible toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Sonicare brushes approximately 2 1/2 years ago.</li>
            <li> After that, though, I&#x27;ll be cross-shopping the heck out of this puppy.l is gone, I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying the one with the flimsy thin slanted head.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one since I hated switching brushes between mine and my wifes.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s impossible if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> i tried a cheaper one and wasted my money :-(.</li>
            <li> The brush should be removed and rinsed after each use as liquid runs down into the base area of the brush.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Be advised that replacement brushes are expensive - $17 for 2 when they are discounted.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I bought one, and will never ever use another old-fashioned brush again.   </li>
            <li> Dental care is so expensive, I wish all could afford the care needed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this toothbrush has delivered on all</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t went wrong.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums would be in worst shape if i hadent starting using this product.</li>
            <li> The Ni-Cad batteries are designed to fail and CANNOT be replaced.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are obscenely expensive.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received was a 7000 series model.  </li>
            <li> Your system is a bit inflexible!</li>
            <li> As everyone might have already told, it sprays the toothpaste foam out if you are careless.</li>
            <li> I was counseled to merely hold it in place and let the bristles glide over my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of thinking and debating whether to go for an expensive Sonicare, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> item went to the wrong address and was refused.</li>
            <li> Just wish the refill brush heads weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> We have 4 units and the oldest failed just after 2 years.</li>
            <li> and it is an expensive \\&quot;throw</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot, and it took about a week or two before it didn&#x27;t feel really weird</li>
            <li> We returned from a two-month trip and mine took about two weeks to recover; unfortunately my husband&#x27;s didn&#x27;t survive.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my dental hygeinist and frankly was skeptical about it at the time of purchase.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve bought 3 others and have had 2 fail in around 2 years.</li>
            <li> When the battery stops charging you throw away one expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just mention this as if you are alone with no one to help you it can be difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not.  </li>
            <li> My student dentist had hoped to use my cleaning as an example for her supervisor, unfortunately for her I had been using the Sonicare 4100 for those eight years.  </li>
            <li> I do think this model is now outdated, it suits well!</li>
            <li> It is a very poorly made product.  </li>
            <li> This makes your lips vibrate and become numb.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It vibrates like crazy.</li>
            <li> When will they start cutting out some of their infinitely bloated profit margins and overhead expenses?</li>
            <li> When will they start cutting out some of their infinitely bloated profit margins and overhead expenses?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go mad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad to BRUSH with it.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Bad for the environment</li>
            <li> Still, it isn&#x27;t a bad toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my hygienist gave me a bad time about tartar build up and gum problems.    </li>
            <li> but when we went to the dentist for our checkups this summer we were shocked.</li>
            <li> I wish they had been around when I was a kid, since I endured tons of painful dental work done that could&#x27;ve been prevented.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed and called the company.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I made the \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; of buying one of the newer designs of Sonicare toothbrushes, and I&#x27;ve been nothing but disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> Then the bf had to get kicked to the curb--he took his sonicare with him. :(  </li>
            <li> I had tried an Interplak brush years ago at the advice of another hygeinist and was disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed as I thought I could just replace the battery.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> It is very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for 14 days as claimed without being on the charging base.  </li>
            <li> I wish they sold just the handle without the base for replacement purposes.</li>
            <li> The brush comes with a battery charger base and a toothbrush cover.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the reason that I hate it.</li>
            <li> 2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  </li>
            <li> Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     </li>
            <li> If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    </li>
            <li> I was sharing the base with my boyfriend</li>
            <li> we ordered another \\&quot;basic\\&quot; (to get the HEAVIER base - we did not like the lighter weight model with those SKINNY brush heads).</li>
            <li> What a costly disappointment the Sonicare turned out to be!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any support from the company, since they are owned by Philips, which has one of the worst customer service records on the planet.  </li>
            <li> I have a terrible tartar build up problem.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other power brushes but compared to manual, well, their is no comparison. They last for many years but I am on my 2nd or maybe 3rd, can&#x27;t remember for sure, but they are well worth the cost. Compared to manual it leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner. I use this along with a water pick.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.  Didn&#x27;t clean teeth quite as well as hoped.  Messy to use when mouth is open to clean front teeth etc.  Heads were small - new heads are expensive and not sure if they are bigger or not until purchase and use them.  Hope it will last a long time for the price paid!</li>
            <li> This purchase is a replacement for the same model purchased over 5 years ago. It is easy to use, and according to my dentist is responsible for the improvement of my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, it really gets my teeth clean and white.  They give you 28 days to see results, but I started getting results in 7 days.  My dentist was real pleased that I bought this Sonicare.  I highly recommend it to anybody, the Sonicare does all the work....</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush and liked it. When it died after about a year and a half I got a Braun, the original model. I thought it was pretty comparable to the Braun. When Braun came out with the newer model that pulsates against your teeth I got one of those. The first time I used it I felt like I just came from the dentist. Of the three I&#x27;ve used, the braun pulsating is the best by far.  One good thing about the Sonicare is that it cleans very gently if you have sensitive gums. And they have brought down the price from the original $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush close to 2 weeks ago and I have not received it yet. The info read that they would ship within 1 to 2 business days. &lt;BR&gt;I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush model for several years and it finally died.  The battery is not replaceable but the charger still worked and I had replacements heads for it, so I wanted the same model, which is discontinued.  Amazon was the only place I could find it and I am very grateful.  It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a great start for electronic toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve actually used the oral B ones before this but those just can&#x27;t compare.  The brush strokes are not nearly as fast as the sonicare brush.  I started noticing my teeth becoming whiter as well after 3 weeks of using it and I&#x27;m a coffee and heavy tea drinker.      The only downside is the replacement heads are so expensive.  That&#x27;s why the 4 star instead of 5.  At the price I got it for, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal but the replacement heads cost almost as much as the price I paid for the unit in the first place.</li>
            <li> I bought this two weeks ago and they aren&#x27;t kidding about the stain reduction. I drink several cups of tea a day and already see an improvement. As well, my teeth feel fantastic. My bottom teeth aren&#x27;t straight and flossing was always a nightmare; now I just brush first and flossing&#x27;s a breeze. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one. I also have some gum pockets that I hope will tighten up. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next dental appt. to see what they say. On a practical note, I think this &amp;quot;cheaper&amp;quot; version is ample. It turns out I brush longer than 2 minutes, and if the brush beeped every 30 seconds I&#x27;d go mad. Also, I bought the compact head, which seems great; even with this extra purchase it was a lot less than the more advanced models. I know some people complained that the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than a few years, but at this price, so what.  Highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare electric toothbrush for years now. I recently decided to buy a new one as the old one was beginning to show signs of wear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brush is advertised as having four (4) 30 second stages (two minutes total) in the brushing action so you know how long to brush the top, front and back, and the bottom row, front and back.  There is supposed to be a fraction of a second stop action built into the product. The product I received does not have that feature built in.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using Sonicare for so many years, the 30 second timing is so part of my memory that I decided I didn&#x27;t need the toothbrush to \\&quot;tell\\&quot; me when it was time to switch to another row of teeth.  So I decided to keep the brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, this is definitely a defect in the brush I received.</li>
            <li> This is my second SonicCare brush. Both I and my wife like the brush, it does a thorough cleaning job, however, my wife prefers the quad pacer timing on the old one, whereas I prefer this one because I found that feature annoying.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be advised that replacement brushes are expensive - $17 for 2 when they are discounted.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York Consumer</li>
            <li> Going from the standard toothbrush to a Sonicare is heaven.  It&#x27;s amazing...really.  I was skeptical until I bought one, and will never ever use another old-fashioned brush again.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd purchase of the same model.  My first one lasted about 3 years, and the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  Came time to replace it, and I shopped around and spoke with a couple of dental hygenists and my dentist.  Everyone recommended either the Sonicare or the Oral-B....and I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out $150 for the Oral-B.  When choosing between the Sonicare&#x27;s, the only real difference are the zone timers which I find annoying and the grip/angle.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money to step up to the next model for me....they do the same thing.  However, some of the newest Sonicare models do pulse at a higher speed.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare power toothbrush and I miss the 30 second beeping to let me know when to move to the next quadrant of my mouth.  This one does give the 2 minute beep, but you have to know when to move to another area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do NOT leave the handle out of the charger very long because the charge does not come back.  If you leave it plugged in all the time, then you have no problem.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this Sonicare standard.  It took four years to wear the battery out on the first one, but after four years of healthy checkups there is no way I would change this habit. I am a mature male with siblings fighting gum disease--not me.  My hygenist knows this is the best thing I ever did for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I had one of this before, it was a replacement. This is a great product, when using it I can tell the difference and feel in my teeth that it is doing the work.  I have the 2min shutdown since I tend to use it longer.  I would like the brush to have more movement though. It is fast but small movement.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for another Sonicare brush I had for years. Just like the old one, this one runs for 2 minutes. I like this one but I wish it had the 30 second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; as the other one did.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works great - much more power than the older version it replaced - I can feel the difference in how my gums feel.</li>
            <li> I bought the Advance 4100 as a replacement for one that had worn out NiCad batteries after seven years.  I don&#x27;t remember the older one&#x27;s model number but the Advance 4100 is identical in size and operation.  Once I was able to extricate the components from the infernal clam shell packaging, no small chore, the brush was ready for use.  The only thing missing on the Advance 4100 that was on the older model is that the Advance 4100 runs for a continuous, uninterrupted two minutes while the older model beeped every 30 seconds during a two-minute cycle.  The periodic beeps give one an idea of how to evenly brush all sides of the mouth.  Other than that, and the diabolically designed packaging, the Advance 4100 product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Knew in advance what to expect with this product since it is a replacement.  Perhaps the next ten years will result in a superior product -  the last ten haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used my sonicare toothbrush for about 2 weeks then it just stopped working for no reason.  I tried to call sonicare but have yet to get through because everytime I call I have to wait to speak to someone.  It was fine while it worked but I am a bit annoyed that I recieved a defective product, and I wonder if my situation is rare or happens often.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life????  This is a great value and a wonderful tooth brush.  Thank you Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> On the fourth morning of usage the toothbrush unscrewed from the base. I tried to screw it back in and noticed a crack up the side of the battery housing and a larger crack around the top. It&#x27;s very sad because my old electric toothbrush was this model and it lasted more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have our own Advance Sonicare toothbrushes. She lets hers discharge fully then recharges. She&#x27;s still on her first handle.     I have been recharging as soon as I finish brushing, and my second brush just gave up the ghost. I plan on following her regimen when I get my replacement brush.    Other than that, the brush has done wonders for my teeth and gums. This is my second brand of electric toothbrush, and is much better for my mouth than the previous brand.</li>
            <li> Wanted the same excellent product, obviously one changes the brushes regularly, but the electric part lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> While I am pleased with the overall performance, I don&#x27;t especially like the fact that this model has a short battery life, necessitating complete replacement every two years.  Think how many manual toothbrushes you could buy in that time!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I have had my Sonicare Advance for 13 years (I also own the [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Elite]] Power Toothbrush), long before Philips acquired the Seattle-based company Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000. When Optiva introduced the Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 circa 1992, it was unlike any electric toothbrushes on the market. The Sonicare Advance 4100 used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by Optiva Corp. The technology allows the Advance 4100 to produce a dizzying 31,000 brush strokes per minute (BSPM)! No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does It Work?&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;YES! 31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush. Whenever I run my tongue across the surfaces of my teeth after every brushing, it always gives me great satisfaction to feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist - no more gritty tooth surfaces resulting from the buildup of plaque and/or tartar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush Head Replacement&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend replacing the brush head with the newer brush head replacements for the [[ASIN:B00008BFXL E-Series (Elite series)]] instead of the [[ASIN:B00008BQVO A-Series (Advance Series)]] Replacement Brush Heads. The E-Series  Replacement Brush Heads are now compatible with the Philips Sonicare Advance 4100. Philips has apparently decided to boost the sales of their E-Series Replacement Bush Heads by tapping into the market for owners of the Philips Sonicare Advance 4100. It&#x27;s a Win-Win for both consumers and Philips. The E-Series  Replacement Brush Heads are smaller and better able to reach the hard-to-reach areas in your mouth. It definitely cleans much better than the A-Series Brush Heads! It turns out, moreover, that (as of this writing) the E-Series Brush Heads are cheaper than the A-Series Brush Heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change That Brush Head!&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress this enough:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change That Brush Head, Change That Brush Head, Change That Brush Head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare performs only as well as the brush head allows it to! Don&#x27;t try to stint on brush head replacements. Philips recommends replacing the brush head every 6 months. I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective. I&#x27;d say change the brush head every 3-6 months. Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you? More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you? Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched? Don&#x27;t believe me? Google it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newer Models&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a newbie to Sonicare, you should know that the Sonicare Advance 4100 Power Toothbrush is an older model. Philips has since introduced the [[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Sonicare Xtreme]] (for teens and pre-teens), [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Sonicare Essence]], the [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Sonicare Elite]], and [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Sonicare FlexCare]] (the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush). If, however, you already own the Philips Sonicare Advance, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the Sonicare Advance works just as well as the newer models. I own both the Sonicare Advance and the Sonicare Elite. The Sonicare Advance works just as well as the Sonicare Elite so long as you use the E-Series Brush Heads on the Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s The Difference?&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare Elite and the Sonicare Essence both have a \\&quot;Quad-Pacer\\&quot; feature, which is a timer that beeps to let you know when its time to move on to a different section of your mouth. Sonicare Elite has an additional feature that allows you to reduce the BSPM. The newest incarnation of the Sonicare Toothbrush, the Sonicare FlexCare, comes with a UV sanitizer for sanitizing the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really recommend the Sonicare Essence since it hits the sweet spot for price vs. features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more? Get the Sonicare Power Toothbrush and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!n to a different section of your mouth.

            <li> Sonicare is the best battery toothbrush on the market......I&#x27;ve been using one for about 10 years........The only reason I bought a new one now is the batteries died on the old one....If you could replace the two AA batteries in the Sonicare without a big hassle,  you would probably never have to buy a new one again.....Replacing the batteries requires removing a circuit board and soldering it back along with two rechargeble AA batteries...I didn&#x27;t have the time for that...    As far as how the toothbrush works,  I think it is EXCELLENT.....This brush will remove ALL the plaque if you use it for 2 minutes,  twice a day...The toothbrush shuts off automatically after two minutes letting you know that you&#x27;ve brushed enough....    When I get my teeth cleaned at the Dentist he has very little to do and tells me that the regular brushing has helped close up pockets in the bone between my teeth...He got me hooked on the Sonicare ten years ago and he was right.........It really works and if they would make it easy to replace the rechargeable batteries,  the product would be perfect.... (Although,  the batteries on my original toothbrush lasted 10 years).......If you know how to work on computer boards,  etc.,  you could replace your own batteries in twenty minutes.......    You also don&#x27;t need the most expensive Sonicare they make......As long as it has the sonic action it will work fine.....All the bells and whistles are just fluff ......</li>
            <li> Works fine. Have been using it daily for a number of years, and this was a replacement.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for me. I was able to buy two products instead of one. My husband and my daughter needed a new one badly. They had one before, one still worked but the other died long ago. We feel they are great tooth brushed. Dental care is so expensive, I wish all could afford the care needed. Thanks so much for giving a bargin in a time when its needed.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. I love it. I got it at such a great deal too. Thanks AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets your teeth clean, and I have noticed that it does better than my previous oral b toothbrush at removing stains.  I drink a lot of coffee and at every dental visit my teeth would have a lot of staining.  This doesn&#x27;t have things like battery indicator levels, and doesn&#x27;t buzz every 30 seconds like my previous one did making my timing off.  However, the price was right compared to the newer more expensive models.</li>
            <li> great price, works great  bought two extra brush heads too    takes a little getting used to, but a great tooth brush  stick with it, you get used to it</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and getting it through Amazon was cheaper, faster and easier than going to the store.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this toothbrush has delivered on all it&#x27;s promises.  My teeth are whiter and they aren&#x27;t as sensitive,  Everyday it feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> i have never had a cavity and i am 50 years old, so you know oral hygiene is important to me.  this toothbrush is super powerful . it massages your gums(mine bled the first use because i have not been flossing enough)and my teeth looked whiter after the first use.this toothbrush makes brushing fun.it makes oral b electric and crest electric(battery powered) brushes seem like kids stuff compared to the high rpm&#x27;s you get off this baby.buy one now ! you&#x27;ll love it and thank yourself everytime you brush your teeth.then you&#x27;ll order one for your spouse and kids just like i did !</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this electric toothbrush, which I have used this same brand for over 10 years, the dentist always tells me what good teeth I have.  Much better than regular toothbrushes.  I take it whereever I go.  I recommend it for anyone who wants good teeth.</li>
            <li> This item is great.  I give it 5 stars.  You have to get use to the vibration like others reviewers have stated.  Several times after using the toothbrush, I have tried to floss and its a waste of time because there is nothing to floss.  The toothbrush takes care of it all.  I feel like I just left the dentist office after a cleaning.  I have sensitive teeth and the sensitivity is starting to diminish.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Soon you&#x27;ll find that two minutes with it is not enough. But it does take a little practice and learning the best technique at first. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing lots of good things about the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes, and my dentist recommended getting a Sonicare specifically, so when I saw this on sale, I had to jump on it.    This toothbrush surpassed all my expectations. I had an electric toothbrush at one point when I was a kid, but I stopped using it for some reason, and the improvements between this Sonicare and the one I had 15 years ago are vast. It&#x27;s much stronger, yet surprisingly gentle on the gums.  The reach is excellent.    I&#x27;ve gotten good mileage so far out of the batteries. Like other reviewers say, it&#x27;s a good idea not to charge after every use and instead only when depleted (NiCd battery).  For me, that&#x27;s about once a week or so.    Overall, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with my return to an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Love it for traveling also since it keeps it&#x27;s charge for a period of time.</li>
            <li> At first, this product was great.  I loved how clean my teeth felt afterwords.  But after a few short months of owning it, I can&#x27;t get it to charge anymore, and the entire casing is cracked up the front of the toothbrush.  The detachable tooth brush part has cracked up so bad it barely even attaches to this toothbrush anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush was a complete waste of my money, and now I have to buy a new one.  I certainly won&#x27;t be buying another Philips.</li>
            <li> The pros of this product is that it polishes your teeth beautifully. It makes your teeth feel smooth and shiney. The cons are that it does not clean between your teeth. It splashes and can be quite messy if you run it when out of your mouth; must be turned on and off while in your mouth to avoid splashing. Would only reccommed if used with a water jet system.</li>
            <li> Product work as described.  I was reading all the reviews before i made the purchase and i didn&#x27;t went wrong.  My dentist really happy about my teeth and it looks clean. Definitely i will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 20 years.  I tried a couple of other brands, but I (and my dentist) think my teeth  feel and look cleaner using the Sonicare. With this model, you can purchase different brush   heads. I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Fast delivery and wonderful product! Just as described. Will purchase again from seller in a minute!!!!!!!!!! A++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and have recommended them to many people over the years and purchased them as gifts for family.     I agree with the reviewer who replaced his batteries - I wish I&#x27;d read his replacement instructions before throwing mine away. Being able to replace batteries with standard cells would have made this toothbrush perfect.    On the positive side, it only cost about $10/year to have fantastic oral care.</li>
            <li> I have used a Phillips sonicare for about 10 years now and was very pleased to be able to order a new on to match the one I wore out.  I have been very satisfied with the reports I get at the Denist since I began using the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Powerful vibrations remove material from teeth and gums in two minutes.  Leaves teeth smooth and clean feeling.  Have been using this for years.  Very powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li> i loved  -LOVED - my sonicare for about 12 months or so - i knew better than to leave it on the charger, it would last a good 10 days and then about a week and then suddenly it only last 2 days.  then seemingly overnight it didnt last even one brushing session! I let it die and recharged, I left it on the charger, i tried anything and everything to get it back to at least doing a full brushing - nothing.  I&#x27;m been trying for a few weeks now and am giving up. I&#x27;ve read the steps people have taken to open it, cut thru the packing and sealants to change the batteries, and then re-seal - it seems a lot of effort for something that should bloody WORK after only one year!   VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BFXG Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush]]  Great product! My husband and I had been looking for this type of toothbrush for quite a while....several much more expensive versions were all we&#x27;d seen.  Saw this as the \\&quot;Deal of the Day\\&quot; and decided to take a chance. Have had for about 3 weeks now and already visible results.  2 minute timing feature is great also.  It does hold a charge for 14 days as claimed without being on the charging base.  Would very much recommend this or similar Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums would be in worst shape if i hadent starting using this product. I will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and I enjoyed using it all the time. However, it seems like it wear out faster than my usual toothbrush. Luckily, I bought replacement brush heads from Amazon with the toothbrush. That&#x27;s my only complain, but otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush significantly improved dental health for myself and my wife. One charge can hold up to a week. It removes plaque much more effective than regular hand brushing.    The only drawback is that it has a somewhat awkward brush head, which sometimes is a little difficult to reach small spaces.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BFXG Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush]]    Every time I get my teeth cleaned, the dental assistant raves about how clean my teeth are! I give full credit to my Sonicare Advance.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes have sealed rechargeable battery. Battery life ended. One has to replace the entire unit. No problems with the replacement unit and delivery was prompt as always.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my old sonicare toothbrush, since I had unused brush heads which do not fit the newer models available in stores near me.  I was worried about quality, as the price was lower than I had paid for the one that died, but the quality is great.    I had the old sonicare for several years.  These toothbrushes are very high quality, the built-in timer is helpful, and I recommend it.  Before moving up to the sonicare, I used Braun, but the sonicare is definitely better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older model and am happy with the product.  I thought buying a newer version would remedy the problems.  There are a few issues with the fact that even if I clean the inside of the toothbrush head, it still collects bacteria there and this seems to be an issue of design of the product.  It works great and the charge lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s not very portable and again, the bacteria issue is something that needs to be resolved.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my family in December. We enjoyed using it but when we went to the dentist for our checkups this summer we were shocked. My 23 year old daughter had her first two cavities in her life. I had two cavities. And my husband had five cavities, soon followed by an abscess and an emergency root canal. I was extremely disappointed and called the company. They agreed to refund my money ($99.99) if I returned the unit. I did and I&#x27;m still waiting for the refund. In the meantime I bought a new Braun, which was the toothbrush we&#x27;d used for the two years before the Sonicare, with much better results. What a costly disappointment the Sonicare turned out to be!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these over the last eight years and I&#x27;ve converted my wife to a customer also.  I like this older model, feels like the newer versions don&#x27;t really add much in the way of actual tooth-cleaning functionality.  I also wish that the device could be powered by eneloops or other rechargeables--it would reduce the waste of a used unit a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item. Its battery cannot be replace what so ever. Like any other electronic products, its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program. Mine lasted about 6 months, at this rate...we&#x27;re going to end up tones of these in our landfill. It is airresponsible to produce products like this. If I had known about this I would never have bought it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff. Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention.</li>
            <li> The product does a very good job of cleaning my teeth and my oral hygienist agrees.  The timer gives a good indication of how long I should be brushing and keeps me &#x27;honest&#x27;.  I look forward to clean teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare 4100. My other one lastest for 10 yrs., until it would finally decide to turn on by itself. Can&#x27;t complain for the amount of use it got, 4 family members for 10 yrs.! I decided to go with another 4100 because it is a solid performer. I decided against getting a newer model Sonicare, as it seems  all they did was add frills to spruce up an already great power toothbrush and raise the price as well. I am just thankful they still offer the Sonicare 4100, as it does exactly what they originally designed it to do, clean teeth remarkable well, and provide a power toothbrush that lasts!</li>
            <li> This new tooth brush takes a little getting used to, but it does a great job of cleaning your teeth even tho the sensation is a bit different.  you&#x27;ll not go back to the old brush again!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about 10 years, and when I bought this new one, I just assumed it would have the quad-pacer that lets you know when 30 seconds is up so you can move on to the next section of your teeth.  The original one came with that feature, and I didn&#x27;t even know they now have it as an extra option.  This one just goes for 2 minutes, without the 30 second reminders.  It is very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Having used a Sonicare toothbrush for a decade, I can state with confidence that there is no toothbrush like it.  My dentist would agree: When I see him, he always compliments me on what good care I take of my teeth.  Fact is, all I do is brush twice a day with Sonicare.  Recently, I finally replaced a very old unit with new one (Model 4100), which I purchased from Amazon.com.  The price was thirty percent less than Walmart&#x27;s (plus I paid no sales tax), and the delivery was swift.  The new one works even better than the old one---which is saying a lot. Thank you Sonicare; thank you, Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Excellent basic oral care. Gives great value compared to the models with all the bells and whistles. Previous (similar) model lasted close to five years without any problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the Sonicare to last more than one year MAXIMUM.  The Ni-Cad batteries are designed to fail and CANNOT be replaced.  They are actually molded into the case and the unit will be destroyed upon removal, which they reccomend before disposal, since the batteries are TOXIC in the landfill.  Don&#x27;t expect any support from the company, since they are owned by Philips, which has one of the worst customer service records on the planet.  Even contacting their website and clicking on their e-mail icon only provides a dead link.  What a joke.  The replacement heads are obscenely expensive.  Save your money and you could  buy a hundred decent regular toothbrushes in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> with the Sonicare 4100 toothbrush. My dentist recommended this or Braun and since I had previously owned a Braun, I decided to switch. I like the toothbrush better than braun. The whole unit is fairly compact. Feels like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Would definitely recommend reading the phamplet and instructions, some helpful information there.</li>
            <li> I got my sonicare 4 years ago.  My son (now a Dentist) got it for me and I&#x27;ve had NO PROBLEMS with the toothbrush.  It does a very good job keeping my mouth clean and I have never had any trouble with it.  In fact I&#x27;m here at this site to buy one for my wife.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Switching to a electric vs hand brush has made a huge difference for my dentist visits.  The gums are healthier as the dentist told me predicted.    I&#x27;ve moved around several times since switching and have seen 4 different dentists and they all have said the same thing.</li>
            <li> We had an old Sonic Care toothbrush that looks like this but had the Quad Pacer. I bought a second one since I hated switching brushes between mine and my wifes.  The old toothbrush charger charges this, so we only need one charger out.  I would give a 5 if it had a Quad pacer that alerts you every 30 seconds, but otherwise this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has saved numerous dental procudures I&#x27;m sure.  I bought this one to replace another that had just run out of life  It must have been 7 or 8 years old.  this one however was missing the 30 second beep and we didn&#x27;t bother sending it back.  We just watch the clock now. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Sonicare Toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had one before and it does a wonderful job.  The price was right and the shipping was fast. Can&#x27;t ask for any more than that.</li>
            <li> I gave as a christmas  gift to both of my adult children - they are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an old Sonic that I used for over 6 years until the battery would not hold a charge. Now I know I could have just bought a new battery unit. Still I apprecite the quality and how much cleaner and whiter my teeth are since using Sonic.</li>
            <li> . &lt;br /&gt;This unit (4100) is the second Sonicare Power Toothbrush I have purchased. The first unit died after eight years - I thought that was pretty good life expectancy.  &lt;br /&gt;This new unit (after two months) is working well, does the customary job and I am quite satisfied. One negative: it has no &#x27;Quadpacer&#x27; (as did my old unit) and I miss that feature.  &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the one that just died.  I had my first one for several years and loved it.  The only problem is that you can&#x27;t replace the rechargeable battery when it dies.  I guess to keep the toothbrush waterproof the toothbrush has to be sealed.  I got by with a manual toothbrush for a while and then just had to have the Sonicare back.  I bought this one instead of the newer model, because I felt that I didn&#x27;t need the extra bells and whistles.  The basic model works excellently.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for many years &#x3D; it was recommended by my Dentist. I have lots of Gold Crowns and it&#x27;s important to keep my gums and teeth brushed.  I just purchased my second one after the first one finally wore out. I think it&#x27;s the best&#x3D;&#x3D;    Arizona satisfied customer&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I was an original user of Sonicare, then switched to the $20 Sonex brand when the Sonicare battery died. I thought for the money that the Sonex was good too, but they are no longer available, so I&#x27;ve returned to Sonicare with this model.    The main improvement appears to be redesigning the base so that it drains and dries better detering mildew, etc.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush works fine, except it does not do the little pause every 30 seconds (as advertised and last one did) to let one know when he is nearing the 2 minute shut-off.  It is great for improving the gums and was recommended by my dentist.  I will definitely stick with this brand since I&#x27;ve had other auto toothbrushes that did not do the job and totally conked out sooner.  Had my last Sonicare for 5 years!  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using the 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush for a couple of weeks, I am totally impressed with it.  It&#x27;s convenient, easy to travel with, and so effective.  I&#x27;ve been an Oral B user forever; I&#x27;ve now found the \\&quot;new way.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. It&#x27;s seriously whitened my teeth. I&#x27;d tell anyone to get it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare 4100 is a very effective product that my dentist approves of.  However, the unit I purchased from Amazon in August lost one of its functions after two days i.e. the 30 second beep quit working.  This does not affect the performance of the toothbrush and I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great, SERIOUS, toothbrush, for super clean teeth.  It think it is in the sonic technology.  My teeth feel like I left the dentist almost everytime, I say almost, because it needs to be fully charged to feel the power.  I don&#x27;t put mine back on the charger after everytime I use it, so at the end of two weeks, the battery is kind of weak.  I should charge it more often, but I often forget to.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge back to normal though, about 4 hours. I would say it needs recharging about one a week, other wise I just leave mine on my sink with out the charger, so that it doesn&#x27;t clutter my vanity.  I like the 2 minute timer that automatically shuts off the toothbrush to indicate you are done.      It is also easy to travel with too.  Before I leave for a trip I charge it fully, and then it lasts for about 10 days without needing another charge.      I have the entry level sonicare, and have been using it for 2 years nonstop, and change the heads every 6-8 months, and still works like new when fully charged.  I haven&#x27;t had any techical problems with it, and for the price, the entry level sonicare gets the job done without having to spend the extra money on the quadrapace timer, or the thinner heads on the other model.  I still can reach way in the back with the a series toothbrush head.    The only real downside, I do have to add is, it will NOT get you out of flossing though. DARN!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Phillips Sonicare Advance 4100 for several weeks now, and combined with a whitening rinse, definitely can see a difference in the shade of white of my teeth!  It is easy to use, and feels great.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, and I love it.  The parts don&#x27;t last forever, however. I wish they sold just the handle without the base for replacement purposes.</li>
            <li> This is the basic Sonicare model and it takes care of your teeth and gums perfectly with no bells and whistles. The only feature that will make you purchase a more advanced model of Sonicare is the quad pacer.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 4 years and it keep my teeth in great condition.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of Sonicare&#x27;s most basic models. It works well, cleans as it should. No major complaints. I do miss the timer feature that my prior Sonicare had. It let me know when to move to each of the four quadrants of my mouth. But no problem, I can figure this out on my own. I think this brush  is a good value.</li>
            <li> This item was never received, but upon calling Amazon  a replacement was sent right away</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare that has the liquid toothpaste for  about 6 or 8 years.  It replaced another brand.  I love it!! T has really improved my teeth and my visits to the dentist.    This new one is really messy.  I squirts toothpaste drops every where.  Also, the plastic on the back of the brush hits your teeth and is not very comfortable.    I am going to buy the Elite 9500 to replace it for my second bathroom.</li>
            <li> Outstadning products and great price reduction since buying our first Sonicare 4100 several years ago.  Old Sonicare 4100 lasted 7 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> Was surprised and disappointed this model does not have 30 second automatic timer to indicate when to change brushing areas.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of this when I made the purchse.  Will probably give this one away.</li>
            <li> This product performed as advertised and was easy to set up.  I don&#x27;t like it because I have a small mouth and the back of the brush keeps hitting the opposite teeth; the buzz is quite unpleasant.  However, for someone with a normal to large orifice, this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the run-up feature, where the brush works more gently for the first few times, till you get used to it, then at full speed.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Sonicare that was 5 years old. I&#x27;m sure this will last just as long. Sonicare works! Great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I purchased the closest Sonicare model to the one I had which died after 5 years of use.  Unfortunately, this model does not have the 30 second pacer, which I really loved with my original one.  It may have been a good time for me to upgrade to the newer model, but I had just purchased two packages of the replacement heads that went with my original model.  As the replacement heads are not inexpensive, I bought the same model in order to use them.  Next time, I&#x27;ll read the product features more carefully before ordering!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week and already my teeth look and feel cleaner than they ever have.  I feel like my teeth have been cleaned by the dentist.  This toothbrush does what the maker claims it does.  I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I switched to an electric toothbrush, and ran across this one.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The Sonicare left my teeth looking very white after just one use, and my teeth just feel cleaner than ever.&lt;br /&gt;As a tea drinker, I contend with the stains that tea leaves.  After my dentist recommended against using the whitening toothpastes, due to their abrasiveness to gums, I thought I was going to be stuck with healthier gums but stained teeth.  Sonicare without whitening toothpaste makes my teeth look better than they did when I was using a regular toothbrush with whitening toothpaste.  (I feel like a ditsy, smiling spokesmodel here but I really was impressed.)&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint has been getting used to brushing with an electric toothbrush--a problem I suspect I would have with ANY electric toothbrush.  You have to get in the habit of putting the Sonicare in your mouth, and closing your lips around the brush BEFORE you turn it on.  Otherwise, you wind up with toothpaste decorating your bathroom mirror, your clothes, and pretty much the entire area around your bathroom sink.  This isn&#x27;t something easy to remember when your half awake and brushing your teeth.  My other only complaint (OK, I guess I have two) is that Sonicare turns off after about two minutes, the time it has determined it should take you to brush your teeth.  Being a little slower with things, I would rather turn it off when I&#x27;M done, not when it thinks I should be done.  Apparently this design feature is to avoid over brushing.  Since you can turn the Sonicare right back on again, this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for how long the charge lasts as I have left it on the charging stand when not in use.  Apparently, however, the Sonicare is designed to hold a charge for quite a few hours, to allow you to take it with you while traveling, for instance, without having to bring the entire charging stand along.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and have seen many results from the use of various electric brushes.  Sonicare far outways its competitors especially for helping to stabilize periodontal disease in conjunction with a 2-4 month visit for perio maintenance.  If the tissue is healthier with normal &#x27;pocket depths,&#x27; then the Braun products, or manual toothbrush used with good technique are fine; but overall, they still do not leave the tissue as healthy (firm) as the Sonicare.  In all cases, the areas between the teeth need regular attention, ie floss, go-betweens, proxybrushes, stimulators, or other effective tools which stimulate the gums and break down bacteria.  The main ineffectiveness of the brush has NOT to do with the brush, but with its inconsistant use, or poor technique by its user.  The main patient complaint I have gotten is that the brush is too vigorous for them, but those complaints are few compared to those who are pleased.  Hygienist&#x27;s opinions vary, so ask yours for an assessment.</li>
            <li> Keep em&#x27; with this little wonder called sonicare.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The 4100 appears to have been discontinued but is still available thorugh Amazon &amp; Wal-Mart. But at Wal-Mart it remains $10.00 higher in price, plus sales tax. This is my 3rd Sonicare 4100. They last 2+ years. But my dental checkups have improved greatly. The vibrating head does wonders in removing plaque. Use it 2X a day for best results.  This is well worth the price, and I still find it better than Oral-B.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare Toothbrush purchase...as usual, I&#x27;m very pleased with how it cleans my teeth (love the quadrapacer feature on my model). There are lots of different models to choose from according to your needs and budget.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonic care brush that I have owned.  My wife and I have gotten many of our friends and family using the Sonic brush.  As far as I am concerned I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I think the 2-minute timer is both good and bad.  It seems like when I&#x27;ve got just two or three teeth left it stops so I have to start it up again.  Cleaning the toothbrush is easy.  I haven&#x27;t had it on any trips yet so I can&#x27;t attest to the battery life, but so far recharging every time I&#x27;m done is working just fine.  The brush heads seem to be wearing well, too.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to buy new heads at the six month mark, so that&#x27;s a good thing &#x27;cause I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare brush and have for about 3 years and it provides unmatchable clean teeth.  The problem is that battery dies after one brushing if that.  I take it right off of the charger and use it, I don&#x27;t let it sit around because it will die before I get to use it. I took precautions to take care of the battery and it got me nowhere.  Good unit but plan on buying a new one every two years.  At the cost that they are, that is pretty pricey plus &gt;$10 per new head.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd 4100.  My first lasted 3 years and then one day just stopped charging.  The charging station alone costs $40!  But, for $40, I got a sealed brand new toothbrush, charging station, and an additional brush head(I had just purchased 2 replacement heads)! They do not sell these anymore in stores and I can&#x27;t imagine why not.  It is the best of any of the Sonicare toothbrushes and well worth the money, especially here on Amazon.  Ebay sellers were wanting $70+!  Amazon has never let me down on their prices, products, or their fast, sometimes FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> I have had Sonicare for years and they are by far the best electric tooth brush on the market.</li>
            <li> Sonicare model 4100 has been discontinued.  I have used this model for YEARS and love it.  However, the newer models have a higher vibration per minute.  A jump from about 20,000 vbm on this model up to 31,000 vbm on the Essence, Healthy White and Flexcare models. In terms of features, the three newer models are ranked low to high respectively with Essence at the low end.     I have ordered an Essence based on the vbm increase, but have not received it yet.  My Mom has used both the 4100 and now has a new Essence.  She does not like the skinny neck on the Essence.     For more information on model differences and benefits, call Sonicare at 1-800-682-7664</li>
            <li> I have had 2 Sonicare brushes which did a great job, but they failed after about 3 yrs. I talked to Phillips Cust Support for Sonicare in Stamford CT on 8.29.06 after the 2nd failure and was told average battery life is 3-5 yrs so I was stuck. The rep did say however that they would honor the warranty for about 6mos past the expiration if it was due to battery failure before 3yrs....too late for me but worth a shot for others with similar issue...</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Since I started using it, my dentist has complimented me on my improved dental health.</li>
            <li> I bought Sonicare for the first time 4 years ago and I loved it. When it stopped working I bought the one listed here. I did not realize this model did not come with the &#x27;30 second&#x27; notifications. My old Sonicare beeped every 30 seconds to remind me to switch brushing areas. Now I am guessing. It&#x27;s just easier to let the beeps tell you than guess how much is enough. Maybe I should buy a stopwatch? jk.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended by my Dentist and has performed very well. &lt;br /&gt;However, they last only 2 years when the &#x27;battery&#x27; dies.  Not a good value.</li>
            <li> used to the oral b toothbrush, so it took a little getting used to, but really like the way this one cleans my teeth and the way my mouth feels afterwards!!!</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Ordering was easy.  Product price and delivery were fine.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome!  (the Oral B is an inferior product) ... Anyway ... I&#x27;ve seen on the other reviews that others have had ones that have died ... 3 yrs, 5 yrs ... Ours were about 5 or 6 yrs old ... My sister-in-law claims theres is about 7 yrs old... I am going to buy another one, old style because I have xtra brush ehads already, but I will definitely continue with the sonicare... good to verify that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the batteries dying... If I take the cynical view, it&#x27;s good for sonicare yo have you buy a $50.00 brush than a $3.00 battery, but some things are just worht the investment... this is one of them ... Whiter, cleaner teeth with out whitening chemicals and less stressful cleanings at the dentist  (P.S.  I spread the toothpaste around before I start the brush... that will all but eliminate the splatter)</li>
            <li> i ordered the same model i&#x27;d used for several years and it&#x27;s still alright with me!  i&#x27;ve gotten great dental check-ups and haven&#x27;t needed \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; since i&#x27;ve used the sonicare 4100.  i tried a cheaper one and wasted my money :-(.</li>
            <li> Replaced a similar model that I had owned for many years.  Works with old charger and brushes.  This is a basic unit but has everything we need.</li>
            <li> This sonicare 4100 is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  I waited 2 years to buy one ( it&#x27;s so hard to justify a $70.00 toothbrush, and I wish I&#x27;d gotten it sooner.  I like the two minute cut off timing...I don&#x27;t have to clock watch or pay attention to anything else while I&#x27;m brushing. I usually do 2 minutes on the top teeth and then two minutes on the bottom teeth, and I just love the way my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done.  The only negative I&#x27;ve run across is that this is one seriously messy process.  Make sure the toothbrush is turned off before taking it out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush!  it is perfect.   although it is the budget model it seems to lack nothing.  the one complaint is that it is loud.  get used to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sonicare 4100, the old model, because I have used one for six or seven years and loved it and I know that the new models (the ones with the skinny neck) are not as good (for me anyway) because they are very rough and noisy whereas the 4100 is very gentle and quiet.  Unfortunately what I received was a 7000 series model.  I no longer have the packaging so I can&#x27;t even return it.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my 9YO Sonicare that had died, and was disappointed to find that this one lacked a feature - called \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; now - that was standard and unnamed on the old one.  I felt that that feature added a great deal to the effectiveness of the instrument and emailed Philips.  Their suggestion was to get a more expensive model, which I did.  My husband doesn&#x27;t have a lot of teeth left, so the quadpacer would be of less value to him; I&#x27;ve given this one to him hoping to help him salvage the ones he still has, and I&#x27;m using my even newer e7300 (separate review).</li>
            <li> While this brush does not have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive models do, it is a great, simple item that does its job well. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Having bought this for my husband &amp; myself around Christmas, I think everybody with teeth should use this to clean their teeth. I bought another to give to my Mom for her birthday. She LOVES it! Both of us say it&#x27;s like going to have your teeth cleaned by the Hygenist, without the trouble. I wish I&#x27;d had one years ago.Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of a sonic toothbrush and I love my new Sonicare.  I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a regular toothbrush.  I can also really see that my gums are healthier.  You can&#x27;t beat this product for the price.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again and wish that I had tried this years ago!</li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush for a week I can say overall I feel my teeth are cleaner than just using the electric $5 pulsar Oral B I had been using for the past few years. The first 2-3 days are needed to get used to the action of the brushing and my gums got a little sensitive as a result. My teeth stay cleaner longer throughout the day and since I have a tendency to brush too hard and too long this has helped me cut back on both. It shuts off after 2 minutes and I&#x27;m putting effort into making sure I don&#x27;t push too hard on the brush. Just let the Sonicare do the work. The only thing that is a bit of a detractor to me is that it is a much larger device than I would have thought. The handle is several times thicker than a normal toothbrush. Make sure you read the instructions to use it right.</li>
            <li> And one of the best Gold Box deals of the day. This is the 2nd SONICARE we order from Amazon&#x27;s Gold Box for my husband, after I got one for me a couple of months ago.  An awesome toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased I found this item on Amazon.  The price was descent.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I could tell a difference in just a few days.  I know it&#x27;s the basic model, but that&#x27;s really all you need.  No need for all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare brushes since 1987.  I have also purchased them for several of my children.  This was a replacement.  I have found that my teeth have had fewer cavities and my gums have been healthy while using this toothbrush.  I would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> My sister originally recommended the 4 series to me (in 1999) because she had to have skin grafts because of excessive brushing, which I also tend to do.  This series was recommended to her by her oral surgeon.  This is now the second Sonicare 4 series I have owned.  The first was purchased in late 1999 and had finally developed a small crack in the frame.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t want a different model because of the longevity of my first one.  My only dissatisfaction is caused by something I missed when picking this replacement.  My first Sonicare 4 series paused slightly every 30 seconds as an alert to change from upper to lower, and also front to behind.  It ran for a total of two minutes.  This newer model runs for a total of two minutes, but doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 seconds to let you know to change position.  I am now using a stopwatch which is a little bit of a pain first thing in the morning, but otherwise okay.  I just wish that I had paid closer attention to the item details before making the purchase.  I don&#x27;t know if the 4 series still offers the 30 second pause function, and if it doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know that I would have paid more than $20 extra for the function to get one of the newer series.  This may be of no issue to anyone else, but I just bring it up for former 4 series owners who expect the same functionality.</li>
            <li> I prefer this \\&quot;old\\&quot; Sonicare Advance to the newer models. It&#x27;s gentle and thorough at the same time. Only issue I have with it is that the base gets destroyed if I take it to Europe (using my top quality adaptor.) However, I&#x27;ve realized that the battery in the brush is so charged that there&#x27;s really no need to plug it in on my trips to Europe. Take the tooth brush and leave the cannoli - oops, I mean the base, and enjoy clean teeth where ever you go.</li>
            <li> This is my forth Sonicare toothbrush, and it works very well. The one thing that needs improvement is the battery. It has a ni-cad battery, and due to the way the unit is sealed, it cannot be replaced. It would be a very good brush, if it had a more modern rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare!  I&#x27;ve had one before and it finally \\&quot;died\\&quot; - I used it most every day, so it received a lot of use.  In fact, I ordered the same model again, because I was so pleased with the first one!  For someone who always had at least one cavity or some other type of dental problem at checkups, and to only have had one in the last 10 years, I am sold on my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you probably don&#x27;t enjoy making trips to the dentist.  Also, if you are like me, you probably don&#x27;t like to have problems with your teeth or gums.  Since I started to use the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush just over a year ago, my gums have never again bled while brushing my teeth (as they once periodically did), my teeth are whiter and my dentist &amp; dental hygienist have been very pleased with the vast improvements in my personal dental health that have resulted.  The reason for the improvement is simple: though using a regular toothbrush is good for the teeth &amp; gums, it is simply not physically possible for anyone to brush as rapidly or with as many strokes (31,000 strokes per minute) as the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush can.  Consequently, use of a regular toothbrush simply cannot provide as much cleansing action as the Sonicare toothbrush.  One nice feature of the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush is that it has a built in 2-minute timer, as well as 30-second reminders that indicate when to move the toothbrush to different locations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you first start to use a Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush, you&#x27;ll have to become accustomed to the vibrations and tingling sensations that occur.  Now that I&#x27;m used to it (just a matter of days), using a regular toothbrush instead of the Sonicare just doesn&#x27;t seem the same as before.  With my vast improvement in dental health and whiter teeth, I give a resounding 5 out of 5 star rating to the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush and highly recommend it to everyone.  After all, we only get one set of adult teeth, so keeping them healthy is well worth the cost of the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time brushing my teeth long enough and with the right amount of pressure (so as to not affect the enamel and gums). The Sonicare is the answer to my dreams!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I LOVE brushing my teeth with this thing. A little beep goes off every 30 seconds so I know when to change positions. And even though it&#x27;s recommended that one brush one&#x27;s teeth for the full 2 minute cycle, I frequently end up brushing for 4 or more minutes since it feels so good and it makes my teeth and mouth feel refreshingly clean. Honestly, can you think of the last time you brushed your teeth with a regular toothbrush for 2 minutes at one time?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, the initial investment is a bit steep. Yet I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the expense. The brushes last about 6 months and cost about $25 for 2 replacements. I still consider this to be a fairly small investment for my dental future. This is a great brush. Try it with confidence! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Yes, a cheapo tooth brush will get the job done if you are diligent have a proper brushing technique but with the sonic I clean for a full two minutes get all the teeth inside and outside plus cleaning the tongue surface. The teeth feel crispy clean and polished just like a trip to the dental hygienist. Initially, the sensation was one of \\&quot;ticklling\\&quot; but after a few uses it feels refreshing. So far so good with the philips on all counts. The secret is to use it often and for the full two minutes to get maximum benefits in oral hygene.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare since 1994 and there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve come to realize: Give or take a couple features, they all clean teeth equally well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one might not have the special 30-second quadrant brushing beeps that some newer ones have. It might not have the skinny, flexible neck either. But when it comes to getting your teeth sparkling clean and impressing your dentist, this one gets the job done just as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery life? Never had a problem with any Sonicare, and this one is no exception. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads? Still a bit expensive, but well worth it. For some reason, I seem to go through more of them with this model than the previous two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Sonicare and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this model again.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush which I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of owning for about 18 months......and now for the warning......during this time the battery performance has gradually deteriorated from keeping its charge for up to 14 days to just 3 days if I&#x27;m lucky! This is a major pain as the battery itself takes up 24 hours to fully recharge each time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I can do about it, except buy a new one!</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare PS-1 Advance 4100 about six months ago. I am very pleased with it. I have never used an electric toothbrush before and even after the first time I used it my teeth did feel like I got a cleaning at the dentist office. I recommend ANY Sonicare toothbrush - they are an excellent brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare because the battery died in the first one which was about 3 years old.  I discovered that Sonicare does not replace batteries, therefore you have to purchase a completely new item.  I did purchase a new Sonicare because this is a great way keep your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd Sonicare Brush. The 1st one lasted 8 years. We just love this product and see the benefits of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I saved $20-$25 by buying the lower-end model.  OK, I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;idiot\\&quot; warnings to know to move to another quadrant.  I&#x27;ve used SONICARE for a long time and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased and also my dentist is very happy with the results I have gotten from the Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush. I have been using one for about twelve years and this was a replacement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I think Sonicare is a great toothbrush. i would never go back to a manual toothbrush. The Sonicare makes your teeth feel so much cleaner, and I have had better check-ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush, even if it is a little pricey, it is well worth the money.  My dentist and my orthodontist recommended it to me.  It works really well if you have any sort of dental work like permanent retainers, braces, etc.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush that I bought works exactly like the advertising says it does. It is easy to use, easy to take care of, and best of all it really does help keep your mouth cleaner. I noticed results right away and it helped get rid of my dental problems like sore, bleeding gums (gingivitis). I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is more noisy than former models, and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to the different wave form of the bristles.  I used to store Sonicare in the charger all the time.  Now I&#x27;m going to use till it runs out of power, and see whether this will prolong the lifetime.  This was true of many older devices with rechargable batteries.  Bill Zahn</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product because I tried to purchase an upgraded toothbrush but was informed it was too late for me to cancel the one I purchased even though it was not shipped and had only been purchased the day befor.  I did not want to go through the hassle of a e-return so I keppt the original purchase.  Your system is a bit inflexible!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is everything I expected and more.  The toothbrush leaves a sensation in my mouth that is tough to describe.  It is like I have had my teeth cleaned by the dentist...</li>
            <li> I bought this to have in reserve.  Our old Sonicare has been working great for - we can&#x27;t remember how many years.  When/if it ever dies, I have one in reserve.</li>
            <li> My old one quit working after 5 years, so I wanted the same model since using it cut cavities down to zero and eliminated any gum pain. Easy to use and well worth the price! Replacement heads slightly pricey, but look for sales.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush    Very satisfied with my purchase.  Shipped quickly and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> The power toothbrush is a great product.  Incase you can&#x27;t stand brushing your teeth for longer than 20 seconds, this toothbrush will keep you going for 2 minutes and then it shuts itself off.  Take good care of your pearly whites and they will take care of your smile.  I think think my dentist will be pleased and I may give my dental hygenist a break.  She always whines about the amount of time she has to spend on cleaning.  Yeah, no more whiny DH.  So there.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using my Sonicare brush my gums have improved 100% and my smile is wide and white.</li>
            <li> I agree with a few of the previous reviews that it works well, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.  My last one lasted a little less than 2 months.  It is a very poorly made product.  If you take steps (i.e. using tape for waterproofing to supplement for poor construction and completely drying the unit off and charger off after every use) you may be able to get a longer life out of it.  I am looking for a better unit as I love the performance of an electric toothbrush.  I am done with sonicare though.  Also, they don&#x27;t back up their product.  I have contacted them several time to no avail.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare Toothbrush.  My first one lasted over 10 years.  I have tried the  \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, do not waste your money. My children &amp; grandchildren also use the Sonicare.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush   Highly recommended, have used one for the last five years.  In fact, on my second one.</li>
            <li> The Philips sonicare advance series is a piece of junk. On my first purchase  I noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they are  supposed to last, cracked in less than 3 months.    When the handle cracked (after about 18 months) I bought another.The new one,    the handle cracked within 3 months, and lasted less than a year.    the heads cracked and did not last even remotely close to the   6 months they are supposed to.  I&#x27;ve tried this brush twice,I&#x27;m through   wasting my money, I&#x27;m going to Oral B (Braun)</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for years(after dentist recomendation) and am buying another to replace. Have gotten them for many family members. Great product, altho replacement heads tend to be expensive</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electronic toothbrush.  I needed a replacement for my first one when the batteries died after many years of service.    I would recommend this item to anyone looking to purchase an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> received quickly,  works good</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for a few years, this is my second one. They are pretty good in making your brushing time adequate. It works for two minutes and shuts off. That way you don&#x27;t quit too soon.    Steve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact model for at least 8 years and have never had a problem with it. It still charges perfectly and I&#x27;ve never had the mold someone else mentioned. My dentist could definitely see the difference when I changed from manual brushing to this. I keep waiting for this one to die thinking I&#x27;ll upgrade to one of the newer and fancier models, but that just hasn&#x27;t happened. When it does I will seriously consider the cost difference before dropping a lot more money when this one has served me so well.</li>
            <li> This wonder-brush save me from costly dental bills and tooth decay.  I&#x27;ve had it for about three years and it still works great. It has lost some of its former power, even at full charge, then when I bought it new but still works fine. It&#x27;s a lazy man&#x27;s key to tooth care. You just hold it in place and let the brush do it&#x27;s magic. I love it. But it does have one flaw that I am surprised that Sonicare has not address yet. Where the brush stem connects with the head can collect water (or saliva, ewww!). And with liquid pooling in that area, leads to mold. You MUST vigorously shake out the Sonicare 4100 after each use or mold WILL grow! Besides that bit of unpleasantness it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> First let&#x27;s start with how I decided to buy this. I am bit lazy to brush twice a day with the manual brush and I have already had enough fillings in my teeth. My brother recommended this for me (In fact, he and his wife have been using this for a long time and they are 100 % satisfied). So I bought one from Walmart with a great deal. I cannot afford the higher end Sonicare models and I just need the Sonicare tooth cleaning functionality, not all fancy timers...so I decided to go for this.     It has many Pros. It Cleans the teeth really well. I bet you cannot get this cleaning with a manual brush. The teeth look shining for a long time. You dont need to waste a lot of toothpaste for this as this fast action brush creates enough foam for cleaning. The handle is easy to grab for me. I am not doing any more tooth pickings. You may use this brush after a heavy food (like chicken, or other meats). It cleans well!. But you still need a flosser to go deep. It gives a good cleaning over back and flat surface of the teeth too...The Cons are really not many or they are negligible...As everyone might have already told, it sprays the toothpaste foam out if you are careless. The battery power won&#x27;t stay for 2 weeks as they claim. I think it&#x27;s staying for around 5 or 6 days for me (Usage: Twice a day). And one more Con, you don&#x27;t know when the battery charge will go away. It happened to me once, the battery power went off in the middle of brushing, so I had to wait for few minutes with the half clean teeth until the brush got charged back to finish up my brushing. So to be on a safer side, always charge it once in 4 or 5 days. Put it in the charger for over night.    But the cons are not big problems so they get overridden by the Pros. I still give 5 star for its class performance. I highly recommend this product to anyone. I hope my review on this product would help you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Sonicare 4100 Sonic Power toothbrush. It felt a bit strange using it the first time, just as it says in the instructions. However, it only takes a couple of brushings before it feels completely comfortable. If fact, I went on a trip and used my old electirc toothbrush, and I felt as if I hadn&#x27;t even brushed. It really is much better than a regular old electric! I am very glad I have my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!  You probably already know how to brush your teeth, so why worry about timers and beeping and such.  The unit turns off after two minutes, and that&#x27;s good enough.  No fancy angled head, and the battery is good for two weeks (brand new) so you can take it on vacation.  The power button can be a little hard for children to press, but this could be a good OR bad thing.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST VENTURE INTO THE MARKET OF ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES.  I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REASONABLY-PRICED THAT WOULD DO A BETTER, MORE THOROUGH JOB OF CLEANING MY TEETH.  &lt;br /&gt;THIS DOES A TERRIFIC JOB.  IT ARRIVED FULLY-CHARGED, AND HAS NEVER LOST THE CHARGE.  IT HAS A 2-MINUTE TIMER TO VERIFY ACTUAL TIME SPENT.  &lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush provides the best cleaning possible!!!  It especially helps older people clean between their teeth and end that \\&quot;Octogenarian Breath\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would give this toothbrush a 5 star for its function, but I can only give it a 3 star given the short usable life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush worked great for 2.5 years, then the battery started dying. Since the battery is non-replaceable, the whole thing has to be thrown away. This is a major disappointment to me considering how much it would cost to replace the battery, and how much it costs to buy a new toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did follow all precautions for taking care of the NiCd battery by draining all charges before recharging which is normally once a week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would either unwillingly buy a new one or find a competing product whith replaceable batteries. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Back in 1997, I thought I was doing a good job brushing my teeth with a manual brush once a day.  However, I hadn&#x27;t had a dental checkup for quite some time due to being a poor college student.  So when I finally graduated and got a decent job with health benefits, I figured it was time to schedule an appointment.  To my horror, the dentist said that my teeth were a mess, and that I needed to have immediate deep cleaning, with further work and checkups done every three months.  She also recommended I buy a Sonicare toothbrush and some floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately complied and began using my Sonicare twice a day, along with flossing in the evening.  When I went back three months later, she was amazed at how much my oral health had improved.  My teeth looked better, I had a lot less plaque build-up, and my gums were pink and healthy.  She revised her initial diagnosis and said I was OK to resume a normal checkup/cleaning schedule every six months.  Whew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare ever since.  I had to replace my first one due to charging failure, but I figure one blowout in nine years isn&#x27;t so bad.  The only usage issue I had was learning to let the brush do the work instead of pressing it down.  I was counseled to merely hold it in place and let the bristles glide over my teeth and gums.  That, along with toothpaste for sensitive teeth, helped ease the discomfort I was feeling after inadvertently brushing too hard.  The two-minute auto shut-off is helpful, since it ensures a consistent and effective brushing period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t started using a Sonicare toothbrush yet (or something similar), then take the plunge.  Make sure you replace the heads when they wear out in order to maintain maximum cleaning power (it&#x27;s kind of easy to put that off).  I wish they had been around when I was a kid, since I endured tons of painful dental work done that could&#x27;ve been prevented.  The Sonicare helped save my adult teeth, and for that I give it my highest recommendation.e it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare that had lasted about 8 years before the power button failed.  I liked my old one better, because it had the \\&quot;Quadrapacer\\&quot; feature, which beeped every 30 seconds to help you know how much time is remaining on the 2 minute cycle.  I never realized how handy it was until I got this unit without the feature.</li>
            <li> Excellent product recommended by my dentist. This will be the second one I have owned. The first one lasted for 3 years. Not bad for $40.00.</li>
            <li> This is my second soniccare. I love it. My dentist notices and my teeth stay cleaner and my breath stays fresher throughout the day. A wise investment.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is my brand of choice for a toothbrush.  This particular toothbrush has everything you need.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years. What I was looking for was a replacement battery that would fit my old charger stand. With this in mind I took the least expensive unit I could find, which does not include the time feature &#x3D; this is extra. I will look for another way to solve my problem next time.</li>
            <li> This company has an excellent reputation in the electric toothbrush field and it&#x27;s well-deserved. My last version of this brush lasted at least 5 years and was trouble-free. The directions, and web site, advise--and instruct--the user on removing the batteries for recycling before disposing the dead brush, though it&#x27;s a difficult task. My only quibbles are really advocacy items: the plastic in the product should be recyclable; the mfg used to include little stickers to remind the user when to replace the head (for the lame among us), and they no longer do; and I fear this model may be phased out in favor of others with more (needless, in my opinion) bells and whistles...the machine turns off after its allocated 2 minutes of brushing, does it really also need sub-timed sequences for each quadrant of the mouth?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know what a clean mouth is until you use a SONICARE toothbrush! My first SONICARE was purchased about 8 years ago and I have not stopped using one since. (I recently replaced it  because my last one just stopped recharging one day.)This one is a slighty different model but it does the same mouth purifying job as the last one. I remember the first visit to the dentist after I started using it and both he and the hygenist said my gums looked great and improved from the last time I was in.(I had the beginning stages of gingavitis in many of my teeth and some more advanced in others.)Since then I have always had a great checkup and my gums are healthy and teeth stay clean.Here&#x27;s a TIP&amp;gt;&amp;gt;I brush with the SONICARE for the two minutes, then I floss, then pour a little LISTERINE on the brush and brush again to tighten up the gums. I can&#x27;t stand to rinse with it for the whole 60 seconds but it&#x27;s not as bad to BRUSH with it.BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!</li>
            <li> I have loved my sonicare brush however they are very expensive to own. Replacement brush heads are &amp;gt;$10 each. Further the battery in my brush has worn out after 4 years. It will cost &amp;gt;$60 to replace the handle. I spoke to the customer service reps and they said the battery will typically only last 4-6 years. FYI the warranty is only good for 2 years. A great brush but too expensive to purchase and own.</li>
            <li> After a lot of thinking and debating whether to go for an expensive Sonicare, I decided to go for it.  After all its your teeth and you show them everytime you smile.  They are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, I love this brush.  I think it is better than a spin brush just for the fact it seems to move the way one generally brushes.  It does feel good after brushing.  The charge seems to hold quite good.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are quite firm and seem to perform quite well.  I have been using this for over one month and all the bristles seems to be in fine shape.  Although they say you change the head every 3 months, for now it seems to me that they would go beyond 3 months easily.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Sonicare sent me a coupon for a free head if I buy 2 heads.  That makes it even better.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get this eletric toothbrush due to a receding gumline.  I&#x27;ve had it over a week and it does a progressively better job of cleaning.  The hardest thing to get used to is the vibration in your mouth.  You have to seal your lips around the brush so paste and spit don&#x27;t spray out.  This makes your lips vibrate and become numb.  My favorite feature is the two minute timer.  The brust automatically stops after two minutes of brushing to keep you from overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while it feels like the spaces between your teeth do not get as clean as the surfaces and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything you can do about it.  After awhile I switched back to my toothbrush and realized I wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job around the gumbline as I was with the Sonicare.  Guess it&#x27;s a toss up.</li>
            <li> This product is the very best. I used Oral-B products but they affected the enamel on my teenth. Sonicare uses another process which avoids this.</li>
            <li> For those complaining about short-lived units:  the key to longevity with this (or ANY Ni-Cad battery device) is NOT to leave it on the charger constantly. Only use the charger after the battery is drained. This way, mine gets recharged once every 2 weeks. Otherwise it sits in the drawer like a regular toothbrush. No manufacturer will EVER tell you that little tidbit for reasons I&#x27;m sure you can figure out yourself. ALL rechargeable batteries have a finite number of usable charge cycles. Once used up the battery will stop taking a charge. Another longevity trick is to take teflon tape (used by plumbers) and seal tightly the hold-down cap of the brush head - this prevents water from rusting out the brush head magnets.    Update: Jan 22, 2011  Well, a second family Advance a4100 finally went to toothbrush heaven. Lasted only a little over 7 years. (Another one in our family was on it&#x27;s eight year when it finally died) Can&#x27;t complain too much about that! That&#x27;s with twice-daily use &amp; charging it ONLY after it runs down completely. I love the Sonicare. A new Essence model in on the way from Amazon as the Advance appears to be phased out of the Sonicare line. Too bad. I hope that the Phillips takeover hasn&#x27;t been for the worse. Also, I have switched to the E series brush heads as they are more readily available than the original heads. Possibly they were phased out also.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement.  I&#x27;ve used this product before.  Overall, it&#x27;s a very good electrical toothbrush.  The charger base of my old one broke during an oversea trip, after more than two years of use.  When fully charged, the toothbrush has approximately a dozen uses or almost a week&#x27;s worth prior to recharging, convenient for a short trip w/o carrying along the charger. The 30-second spacer during a 2-min use is another handy feature.</li>
            <li> The sonicare advance 4100 power toothbrush was purchased as a replacement for an older model.  My husband travels a great deal and needs a toothbrush that will hold a charge for several days.  This brush holds a charge for about 5-7 days.  The brush comes with a battery charger base and a toothbrush cover.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a year ago. It has been good except it needs frequent charging. Now it is dead.</li>
            <li> Its a good product. The battery hold for 5 days or so if you brush your teeth twice a day. Very easy to clean and the brush head itself seems to last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for about five years. They have really made a difference in my gum health. Not sure how to rate them against other electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.  My oder was received at record speed and I am completely satisfied witht the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and continue to find them reliable. If your dental hygienest has little to do inside your mouth when you go for a cleaning you know the brush worked.</li>
            <li> Replaced old 4100 with new one BUT they neglect to say that this model no longer has the 30 second timer.  It does shut off after 2 minutes but the 30 second timer is only in more costlier models.  I would not have purchased and used this one if I had known.</li>
            <li> I have had my SonicCare for over 2 years now and it works terrific.  I like that it shuts off after two minutes because I know I&#x27;ve brushed long enough.  I always turn it back on and finish up, but I know how long it&#x27;s been.  I do not like to buy the replacement heads because they are so expensive, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it.  I have taken mine on several vacations over the past two years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with losing the charge.  I leave my on the charger whenever I am home and using it on a daily basis.  I don&#x27;t know that I would say my teeth have gotten any whiter since I&#x27;ve been using it, but my 6 month dental check-ups have definitely improved!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my girlfriend. I am very impressed by the way it operates. If you look closely, it is shaped like a regular toothbrush (No circular brushes) so while it doesn&#x27;t provide a spinning motion for brushing, it does vibrate and help you brush near the gums without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea that this unit does not need much charging. After charging full when we got this product, it runs seamlessly for about 1-1/2 weeks. For a small looking unit, this toothbrush has weight! Feels like your holding a real tool while your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent brush for the price, most other Sonicare brushes are easily over $100. And with the battery life and brushing power, I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works as advertised, noticed a difference right away - it&#x27;s like going to the dentist to get your teeth cleaned. Couple of things to keep in mind, it is (like any power toothbrushes) a little messier than a manual toothbrush especially when reaching the back teeth. The brush should be removed and rinsed after each use as liquid runs down into the base area of the brush.    Only problem, one of the tiny magnets on the end of the brush came loose somehow and stuck to our sink fixture. We didn&#x27;t notice it missing right away and the next time the brush was used, it didn&#x27;t seem to be vibrating much. We thought the unit was defective until I noticed the missing magnet. Stuck it back on and it worked perfectly; although, it must be in the correct orientation. Seems like they are simply magnetically held in place, maybe they should be superglued as well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this product daily for more than 10 years...and the unit was placed back into the charger after each and every use!!! A truly amazing, quality product based on our experience.</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing with the Sonicare 4100 knowing that I&#x27;m helping to prevent gum disease.  I only wish that this model had the 30 second intervals like the original model I purchased over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas present a couple years ago.  It works pretty well.  I switched from a regular toothbrush to this and you definitely notice a difference.  I don&#x27;t know about getting my teeth whiter but my teeth, in general, feel cleaner.  The only complaint I have is that the brush head is kinda large, the bristles a little too soft for my taste, and the shaft is short so it can be to clean my back teeth (I think my mouth is a little smaller than average too and that might be a reason as well).  The crossaction regular toothbrush that I switched from worked better in that respect.  I&#x27;m thinking about trying the compact replacement heads to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Advance but as my dentist said, I still need to floss. Nothing can substitute proper manual flossing! Using this toothbrush, I can really tell a difference when I rub my tongue against my teeth and gums, wow! Cleans much better then a regular toothbrush. Replacements are expensive but its worth it. The one thing I would change is the cord. I hate cords and have little space and would love the base to have a retractable cord. Besides that, great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> If you have receding gum&#x27;s or just want the cleanest mouth in town this is it!To the person above my brush went out after 3 year&#x27;s so i called sonic care toll free and they sent me a new one i did copay on it but they where very fair! As for the people  thinking the replacement brushes are a little spendy they are more then just the brush as they have the magnet part in it also and they usually have a two pack on sell for under 19 dollar&#x27;s. As far as the vibration when you start using it may take a week to get use to it and yes close your mouth or you will have tooth paste flying all over ! WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANY THING ELSE My dentist check up&#x27;s have been great and my gum&#x27;s are healthy! 5 STAR PRODUCT! BUY ONE!</li>
            <li> Got two years tops out of the battery which canNOT be replaced.  Bad for the environment and it costs a fortune.  My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better.  I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth.  As a matter of fact I read a report comparing these three brands and the Braun won out by a good amount.</li>
            <li> Bought new Sonicare to replace old one which finally gave out after a number of years of good service. New one works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> It does a great job. This is my 4th order of the Sonicare. I have just ordered 2 more for my kids. Nothing is better than sonic for a gentle yet complete brushing in a 2 to 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the sonicare series since about 1997 or 1998. My first one lasted 5 years. I was surprised how well the battery lasted. When it died, I got another one that only lasted 2 years. But, I used an amex card to purchase and since the card has a double your warranty extension called buyers assurance. Amex paid for the replacement via a full purchase price refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This current model that I have now purchased 2 for my kids, does not have a couple of the features that my earlier models and the more expensive series have. I never cared for the quad pacer 30sec interval beeps that are supposed to tell you when to move on to another part of your mouth. It was more annoying than helpful for me. The only other difference that I noticed is that the button light does not blink while charging and stop when finished. As it turns out, a good thing. Who Cares? After the first charge over night, just use it and return it to the cradle. The instructions say that you don&#x27;t need to cycle the battery and actually recommend leaving it in the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used a gym 5 days a week, I would only charge it on weekends. Not that it would die in the first week, only to avoid the potential dead battery in the second week. In the early years, I actually had forgotten to charge it and did make 2 weeks on one charge. I don&#x27;t know yet if there is a low battery reminder beep like my old one yet. I have not tried going without a daily charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the sonicare, whichever you choose. If you use amex and it dies in less than 2 years for a one-year warranty and 4 years for a two-year warranty, you will be getting new ones without paying. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> Similar to many people here, my dentist suggested that I start using a Sonicare. I bought the Advance model about four years ago and used it anywhere from 2-4 times a day.  My dentist noticed the difference right away and recommended that I continue to use it.    I typically get about 12 days between charges, so I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of charging it on the 10th and 20th of the month.  About a year ago I went on a trip and it died two days into the trip.  I later noted that my Sonicare had just turned three and had undergone less than 100 charge cycles.  A good set of rechargeable batteries should last anywhere from 300-900 charge cycles, but the Sonicare is using a unique wireless charging system that may or may not have a detrimental impact on the batteries.      In an attempt to prevent another item from being sent to a landfill, I contacted Sonicare, told them that my batteries appeared to be dead and asked to have them replaced.  I offered to pay for shipping and cost of the batteries, but they advised that they don&#x27;t provide that service, but would be willing to sell me a new one at a discount. I thanked them but declined.    Since the warranty expired, I took a Dremel tool to the Sonicare and opened it up.  To my delight, I noted that the batteries employed by the unit were two standard, albeit unbranded AA NiCad cells.  I removed and replaced them with two 600mah Sanyo cells, closed the handle and sealed it shut with silicone.  It&#x27;s been over a year now and my Sonicare is working as well as it did the day I bought it.  For the gear heads out there, the Sonicare consumes about 1.3 watt hours and lasts about 14 days between charges when used twice a day. This equates to about 56 minutes of total run time, which means that the original batteries installed in the Sonicare were ~600 mah.  I considered replacing the batteries with 2000mah NiMH cells, but opted against this option as the cells would probably self-discharge before I depleted the cells from normaluse.      I disagree with another reviewer and do not believe the Sonicare should use Li-Ion or Li-Poly cells.  Li-Ion and Li-Poly cells require sophisticated charging and discharging circuitry.  They also last fewer recharging cycles than NiCads.  Conversely, NiCads take a lot of abuse and in an application of this size, they provide more than enough storage capacity.  For the bean counters, NiCads are cheap to source.  However, the cadmium in NiCads is highly toxic and not exactly the most environmentally friendly option for batteries.  Compared to NiCads, Nickel Metals would be a better environmental choice but would provide little performance benefit.      I like the Sonicare, but I don&#x27;t approve of the idea of buying things and having to replace them because it was designed last a finite period and not be user serviceable.  I would have given this item 5 stars had it been designed to allow the user the option to easily replace the batteries when they died as well as a having some sort of reclamation process for the $12 replacement heads.    Updated to add:  I just bought a new brush head over the weekend and they&#x27;re up to $20 now for a single and $30 for a pair.(2 October, 2006)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  In fact, when the battery died in my first one, I really missed it and I had to immediately order another.  My only complaint is that the battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped in my first one.</li>
            <li> Now we have a his and a hers, much to our total satifaction.</li>
            <li> If it works WELL, why try to change it?  I made the \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; of buying one of the newer designs of Sonicare toothbrushes, and I&#x27;ve been nothing but disappointed with it.  The heads on that newer design are harder to change than the ones on the 4100, and it takes up more room on the counter.  This older, classic design is simple the BEST.  It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;broken\\&quot; and why \\&quot;they\\&quot; tried to change it, I&#x27;ll NEVER understand.  The Advance 4100 is the \\&quot;right\\&quot; choice.  Don&#x27;t blunder into those newer designs. Stick with the classic.</li>
            <li> Amazon did not send the item to the zip code they had in their database...item went to the wrong address and was refused. &lt;br /&gt;I was not notified until the order was cancelled, and was told I could reorder. &lt;br /&gt;The free shipping and discount for new Amazon credit card was not honored, so I did not reorder. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes for about 5 years, and continue to have wonderful dental checkups.  This is a great value, priced right for the quality received.  (Bonus tip - if you brush twice a day with a Sonicare, you don&#x27;t need to floss, and you STILL get great checkups.  No dental professional will tell you this, but it true for me. I get better dental checkups using Sonicare twice a day than I did when I used it only once a day and flossed daily.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my old Sonicare (which lasted about 7 yrs, by the way).  This is a great value. &lt;br /&gt;Takes some getting used to, but if you are a coffee drinker you will really see the difference in the whiteness of your teeth. &lt;br /&gt;And your mouth will never feel cleaner! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had a previous unit with more bells and whistles but costs twice as much to replace. This at half the price and does the job. Sturdy and works the same at the business end off the brush.</li>
            <li> This is our third one.  The first lasted almost 3 years after daily use by 3 different people.  My son is using this one now in his own bathroom and is very happy with it.  It beeps every 30 seconds to remind you to brush another quadrant of your mouth for a total brush time of 2 minutes.  You can turn it back on and brush longer if you want.  The beep feature is helpful.  Just wish the refill brush heads weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.  They really need replaced every 6 months (at least!).  You can sometimes save a few dollars by getting them on ebay.  Good product.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I have purchased. The previous one worked well for over 10 years. They do a great job cleaning teeth and exercising the gums.</li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare I have purchased.  The second one my son took to school with him.  Definately recommended to everyone!  There is a noticable difference in the whiteness of one&#x27;s teeth!  The two minute timer is an excellent way to make sure your teeth are brushed as recommended by your dentist or hygentist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most Excellent!</li>
            <li> After using my first Sonicare for the past 6 years and having no problems at all, it was quite natural that I would be a repeat customer.  The only concern I had was  could I find the same model as my orgional?  Sure enough I did and look forward to another 6 years of good service.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommeded this item and it works better than I expected.  It has already improved my gums and saved me from oral surgery.  This is the basic item and unless you&#x27;re an idiot it&#x27;s all you need from a Sonic Care toothbrush.  All the more expensive versions offer is needless beeps and ways to let you know when 30 seconds are up.  If you hate flossing and aren&#x27;t likely to keep up with it, this Sonicare will do the job between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Every bad review I&#x27;ve read for the Sonicare 4100 seems to be about the battery life lasting only 1 year (or the hilarious one about the root canal!).  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get that far!  In the past year, I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of these toothbrushes and they keep vibrating themselves to pieces!    Mine develop tiny cracks that then spread like a car windshield due to the vibration, resulting in the brush falling apart (and no, I didn&#x27;t drop them).  My 3rd brush just fell apart tonight!  I&#x27;m assuming that there are microscopic faults in the plastic that are susceptible to the vibration, and then spread.    I really like the brush, but so far, I&#x27;ve spent over one-hundred-fifty US dollars in the past year on them and I hesitate to buy another one.    Has anyone else had an experience like this or am I just cursed?  Please add a comment and let me know.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Replaced same item that quit working after about 5 years. Obviously, it is a good product. Far more vigorous brushing than can be done by hand.</li>
            <li> I just got a replacement for my similar model Sonicare.  After about 10 years of use, the off/on switch wore out.  I gave this one a five star rating based on the lifespan of my old one.  The brush has done an excellent job for me.  I have a terrible tartar build up problem.  Before I got my Sonicare, I had to get my teeth cleaned by a hygienist every 3-4 months.  Since I got one and started using it with Rembrandt toothpaste, my visits have dropped to twice a year with one half the time in the dentist chair.    Use is much easier if you put a little toothpaste on your fingetip and rub it on your front teeth.  Then you can start the toothbrush before you put it in your mouth without consequence.  This is easier for kids, too.  I actually turn mine on, and hold it under a stream of water low in my sink before I put it in my mouth.  It softens the bristles a bit.  I leave the brush running, move it away from the water, give it a couple seconds for the drops to shake off, and then put it in m mouth. I leave it running the entire time. The brush does have to be off before you take it out of your mouth, of coure.  Finally, just a little dab of toothpaste does the job.  Saving money on toothpaste cuts the bite of the brush cost.</li>
            <li> This is the family toothbrush.  We are on our second unit.  We have found this to be an extremely good tooth brush.  The clean feeling after brushing can only be matched by when you walk out of the dentist office.  I find using the compact head brush unit (rather than the regular) fits more comfortably in my mouth.  This has been an oral care work horse that I would want to do without.  As a side note, smaller hands find it difficult to handle and manipulate the adult sized base unit.</li>
            <li> Love this Sonic Care Toothbrush.  Bought this as a repalcement for a prvious one that after five years stopped working.  Great dental check-ups since using this device. Got it quickly and no problems!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare about 9-10 years ago at the urging of my dentist. In the very beginning I did not like it, but quickly got so used to it, that I just do not feel my teeth are really clean when I use a conventional toothbrush.    After all these years of service, it finally stopped holding a charge (as is the case with all rechargable batteries) so I bought a new one and it is performing just as my other one did, and has met all my expectations.    There is an almost bewildering number of models to choose from now, so I purhcased the one I had experience with, and am very happy with it. I would recommend the Sonicare toothbrush to anyone.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was purchased in 2002 and it performed perfectly until this year the battery finally would not hold a charge.  It has performed beyond expectations and I expect this replacement to do the same.  Sonicare toothbrushes are the most recommended by dentists.  If you are still using a manual brush, you&#x27;re missing out and you are doing your teeth a disservice.  The Sonicare gives a cleaning that rivals a cleaning in the dental office.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because the 30 sec timer does not work. But the product works otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have owned electric toothbrushes before. I had a braun for several years and then switched to manual. I don&#x27;t remember this dentist clean feel after brushing with my old tootbrushes. I bought this here for $55.00 with free shipping.  Only to see it at Bed, bath and beyond (BBB) for $39.99, 3 weeks later. With the 20% coupon that you get in the mail every month from BBB that adds up to your savings.  So check BBB first before buying it here.</li>
            <li> After my dentist told me I had gingivitis I knew it was time to start taking better care of  my teeth. After I did some research I decided upon this model toothbrush even though it was a bit more expensive than what I was used to paying for a toothbrush.  After a month of use I can say that my teeth are noticeably whiter which I was amazed by. It does a good job of cleaning thoroughly your teeth and the timer is excellent because I never know how long I should be brushing my teeth for. I completely recommend this product and I probably will never go back to brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these in the last 14 years and would not be without one. It is sturdy and reliable and does a good job of getting your teeth clean and messaging your gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with this purchase. It cost half than what the other brands charge (I had gotten it on sale here for $40) and it leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  I noticed my teeth had gotten brighter after 2 weeks (and I thought that was just a marketing gimick).  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to manual brushing now.  I actually look forward to my 2 min. per day brushing every night.</li>
            <li> System is a very fine system.  I had the same product for about 6 years prior to this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  It took a week or two for me to get used to brushing with this new brush, but once I did its been great.  My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist when I finish brushing.  Also, one charge lasts 2 week easily for this brush.  I would highly recommend this brush for anyone in the market for new one.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush]  This Sonicare toothbrush is only supposed to last 2 years.  Our other one just gave up the ghost after 8 years of use by my wife and myself.  We were so happy to find the same exact on on Amazon.com.  Thank you so much for your wide variety of products that can be ordered from your site.</li>
            <li> My old one quit after 8 long years.  I did try to find a replacement  since I had some brushes for this model.  The brushes are costly, but  I had some from a cvs store which did open.  The vendor was great,  and I was real happy with my old brush.  Why I did go for this one-  cost, and value! I do think this model is now outdated, it suits well!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is absolutely the best automated toothbrush on the market. I am a retired dentist that has been using this toothbrush for 5 years. I am on my second one after the first finally quit working after 4+ years. If you floss and use this toothbrush twice daily you will certainly be doing your \\&quot;homework\\&quot; as far as oral hygiene is concerned.</li>
            <li> I hate the item for only one reason: it was so long in storage that the battery couldn&#x27;t charge fully to work effeciently. The fact that its not being manufactured anymore adds to my dissappointment.  That&#x27;s the reason that I hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the sonicare electric brush for over 25 years. I have a serious plaque problem and gum issues. I still get my teeth cleaned every 3 months and I get good check-ups because of my sonicare use. It keeps my gums healthy and lessens the plaque removal by my hygenist. I am very pleased with my sonicare and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hygienist has always commented how well my teeth are cleaned by this Sonicare.  However, in the 15 years I&#x27;ve used various models of this type, I&#x27;ve had to buy 4-5 because of the NiCD rechargeable batteries they use, and which I hated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, dentist grade&lt;br /&gt;vigorous brushing&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use&lt;br /&gt;Charger is effortless and inductive, no exposed connections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Battery dies in 2 years, needs  to be &#x27;reconditioned&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive brushes&lt;br /&gt;Expensive handle&lt;br /&gt;Disposable, the handle is rubber coated and sealed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the expected lifetime of the battery is 5 years or more, the NiCD have a &#x27;memory effect&#x27; and to get rid of it you have to run the brush down to near zero power.  Alas, it has a built it timer, so can&#x27;t just leave it on so it will run down on its own.  You have to keep using it, and then one day, it stops working, now you can&#x27;t brush.  In the years I&#x27;ve owned it,  However, even with reconditioning by 3 years you&#x27;d only get 3 days of per charge doing once a day brushing compared to nearly a week when new, mainly because even if powered to &#x27;near&#x27; zero you can&#x27;t really deep discharge these batteries without unmounting it, which means destroying the handle.  So the reconditioning can only go so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since converted to the e-series AA battery model which is now going past 5 years, and its battery is strong and reliable, because I can replace it myself and it needs to be recharged only every 3-4 months using eneloop [[ASIN:B005ILYG4M eneloop AAA 1800 cycle, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries, 8 Pack]].</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was recommended by my dentist. It is everything an eclectic toothbrush should be at a great price. I have had one like this for over 4 years before the battery stopped holding a charge. I was so satisfied with it that I bought another one just like it.</li>
            <li> I received one that didn&#x27;t work. As soon as the initial charge wore off it stopped and wouldn&#x27;t recharge. I sent it in to the manufacturer and received a refund. I then ordered a Braun which works OK.</li>
            <li> The 4100 is not as sexy as the new Sonicare brushes but it works and I love it. I was not sure this thing really worked or just made me \\&quot;feel better\\&quot; untill I asked a profesional. Long story made short... I have very healthy gums but tooth decay is a problem. For the first time in my adult life I got a clean bill of health from the dentist and this was after 6 months of use. I feel the 4100 will be phased out soon replaced by new models, I&#x27;m sure the new models are better but the old one is still miles above what anything else can do!</li>
            <li> I think I got a good price on this product, cheaper than everywhere else I looked. It works great.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other Sonicare toothbrushes and love them! I shopped around and due to Amazon&#x27;s FABULOUS return policy and excellent customer service...There was no question where I would purchase. Their price was very competitive and their excellent customer service made it easy to feel good about buying here!</li>
            <li> Even though there are more advanced power toothbrushes out there, my family has had this model since it first came out several years ago.  Our dentist recommended it when my husband had problems with his gums.  We all received better dental checkups on our next visit.  The product has a two-minute timer that lets you know every 30 seconds so you can switch to another area of the mouth.  This makes sure you are brushing for at least two full minutes.  The brushes come in a set of two each with a unique color band.  You can purchase another set of two brushes in two different colors so a family of four could each have their own color to avoid mixup.  The brushes easily screw on and off the unit and can be placed in a stand until the next use.  The main unit comes with a charger/stand.  The entire product is compact and can easily be packed for travel. We recently purchased another Sonicare - same model - when ours died because we had just purchased replacement brushes.  We would recommend the Sonicare to anyone considering a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works well and has improved the check ups for all of us. We have 4 units and the oldest failed just after 2 years. (just out of warranty) We think it is the NiCad batteries which have limited life and always develop a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;. Checking the manual, website and contacting Phillips we were told they cann not be replaced. We were told how to remove the double AA batteries, but the unit is designed so you destroy it in the process. So the bottom line is you can not change the batteries and it is an expensive \\&quot;throw a way\\&quot; product which could easily be designed to have replacement batteries. So if you buy one be prepared to replace it every 2-3 years. This also means more waste and many will be thrown away with the batteries which is an enviromental disaster.</li>
            <li> I just graduated college and since I am without insurance I can&#x27;t afford to make my twice a year dental appointments.  At my mom&#x27;s urging I purchased one of these just to be sure I&#x27;m brushing well.  Everyone in my family owns one (different models)...and all I can say is amazing!!  It is a little bulky at the handle, but it has a nice smaller brush head (since I have a smaller mouth this is a good thing).  It makes my teeth so shiny and squeaky clean and my gums look healthy too (they were never in bad shape,) but it was well worth the price.  i am so pleased.  It shuts off after two minutes, sits nicely on my vanity, and after filling out the registration I&#x27;m getting 27.99 worth of coupons (I&#x27;m assuming for brush heads and such).  I&#x27;ve become addicted and brush more than twice a day (3-5 times a day) which is great.  I just love the invigorating feeling. I really do feel the healthy difference of investing in this product.      UPDATE: I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to a manual toothbrush.  This gets your teeth from-the-dentist clean, seriously!    Just don&#x27;t skimp on using floss and use mouthwash!    pros: gets your teeth super clean, use less toothpaste    cons: toothpaste can dry in crevices, so it must be cleaned, no warning beep before it needs to be recharged--sucks when i&#x27;m in the middle of brushing and it shuts off.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare 3 years ago at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  It was flattened by several cars in an unfortunate motorcycle accident (I did recover the remains).  My dentist bugged me to get another, and since this model is cheap, I got it.  My dentist said the newer models aren&#x27;t much different, as they apparently just have different fancy timing options (which seem gimmicks to me).  The sonic waves from this toothbrush with sonic waves seem much more effective than the OralBs which just spin.  My dentist notices my lack of flossing less when I use this.  I love it :)</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  It is a great product. Even my dentist commented on the difference.  I have gotten my girlfriend to try it and I&#x27;m buying her one so we don&#x27;t have to change brush heads back and forth.</li>
            <li> We ordered a new Sonicare to replace the one that had given us over five years of daily use by two adults.  Another plus of the Sonicare is better check up reports from our dentist. This household will not be without A Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve blown all the punchlines in the title,clearly an ode to both capitalism and the champagne it brings us.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this exact item.  My other one lasted 7 years!  Manual toothbrushes just don&#x27;t cut it.  I&#x27;m glad to have my Sonicare back.  It cleans better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush.  This one is faulty, in that it does not have a 30 second timer to let you know when to change positions in your mouth.  I think that I just have a bad product and probably should have sent it back but was leaving town for an extended vacation and did not have time.  I miss the timer very much.  The product itself is excellent and does a very good job on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Have used this style product for years, junked my old one which was not bad at all for the new 9500 series.  It broke in less than 3 weeks.  The company was eager to replace, but it was \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; at best, the head and neck are weak.  Re-purchased my old model and am happy with it.  Some reviews state the 2 minute timer does not work, mine did not either until I exhaused the 30 minute use mark.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush to replace my six or seven year old Sonicare which I thought was broken (it turns out I just had a faulty outlet in my bathroom).  The thing I DO NOT LIKE about this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t let me know every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to another part of my mouth (like my old one does).  My advice --- get the one that gives you this helpful little signal AND check your electrical supply before you replace a perfectly good (SEVEN year old!) appliance!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Been using one for years. Have given as gifts.  Dentist recommended and he was right.</li>
            <li> The angle of the brush makes it kind of hard to brush without making a mess.   But that said, it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> We bought the kids one of these for each after the cheaper [[ASIN:B000LJ86G0 Sonicare Xtreme E3000 Power Toothbrush - Orange]] failed repeatedly - we actually had Amazon send us replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the perfect way to introduce tweens to a toothbrush that&#x27;s going to keep their teeth happy, clean and healthy for as long as they need to bite and chew things. They&#x27;ve been using them for almost one year now and they work as expected. No breakdowns whatsoever and the price is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend more money on an Elite, then definitely go for one of these because it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.     1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That&#x27;s what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.     They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)    2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don&#x27;t have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li> Takes the guess work on cleaning by automatic shut off feature when brushing is complete. It leaves my teeth feeling like a professional job was done in cleaning my teeth every time. And I can travel with it and stays charged for a long weekend.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement sonscare toothbrush - it performs very well - after tis first charge i have brushed 20 times and its still going</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find that the Sonicare Advance I purchased fits the three e series brush heads that I still have when my previous Sonicare&#x27;s battery gave way.  This new combination provides me with a more superior brushing performance to remove plaque.  The ordering and receipt process of the Advance from Amazon was also a delight.</li>
            <li> Mine holder/handle died after 10 years of use and could not find this specific model anywhere except on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I bought a used Advance toothbrush.  I got some new brushheads for it, charged it up and it has worked extremely well now for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dies, I will replace the Ni Cad batteries in it and use it as I have - letting the thing run until it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still possible to get Advance brushheads.  Sometimes, a generic one may be the only one available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare should resurrect the Advance Model.  The Amazon price for a new one is, frankly, absurd.</li>
            <li> I compare using this toothbrush with just having my teeth cleaned by a dentist.  I originally bought a Sonicare for my husband and it worked so well we bought the extra heads and we share the same base.  Now he is traveling so much that I want my own base.  It is several years old and still brushing very well, neither of us having any complaints.  In fact, we were both so happy with the results, that I bought my father one as well.  The next time my dad went for his usual cleaning, the dentist was amazed at how clean and nice looking his teeth were.  As a daily coffee drinker, my dad would have bad coffee stains on the inside of the teeth, that the dentist would have to work at to remove.  Since he got the Sonicare, cleanings are much more pleasant and less work.  For smokers, the Sonicare will remove stains if you use it on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s truly amazing what this brush can do and it&#x27;s worth the money. I don&#x27;t think it matters which particular model of the Sonicare you get.  Sure it sucks that the battery can&#x27;t be replaced but if it lasts you for approx. 4 years, isn&#x27;t that worth it?  I proudly recommend a Sonicare to everyone.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be enough of a minimalist that the idea of an electric toothbrush seemed excessive to me.  When my friend raved about hers (she has used hers for 5 or 6 years now) she said that it changed her life.  I gave it a shot, and it took about a week or two before it didn&#x27;t feel really weird but now I absolutely love it.  On the occasions that I use a regular toothbrush my teeth simply don&#x27;t feel clean like they do when I use my sonicare.  I love this toothbrush and and feel it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My initial reason for wanting this brush was that it was mechanical.  I&#x27;m a gadget geek; I can&#x27;t help it!  So my mother bought it for me for Christmas two years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it religiously since then.  This toothbrush takes a bit of getting used to, but it does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  My dental hygiene was good before buying this brush, but I feel like my teeth are even cleaner now.  The vibrations keep my gums cleaner and healthier, too.  Every time I go into the dentist now, I always get complimented on how clean my teeth are.  I have very little tartar (which saves me from that painful process), and though I had the beginning stages of gingivitis when I was younger, those have cleared up completely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The main two things that take adjusting are the wider handle and the vibrations.  If you&#x27;re ticklish from the toothbrush they use in dentists&#x27; offices, you&#x27;ll have the same problem at first from this one.  However, it takes very little time to get used to the vibrations, and in fact if I use mine without it turned on (such as when I forget to recharge it), my teeth feel numb!  Speaking of the battery, it&#x27;s supposed to last for up to two weeks.  Thus far, my brush has always lasted that length of time.  I do wish there was a warning to let you know when the power was running down (I think one of the higher-end models does this), but otherwise the battery lasts as long as the company says it should. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are the price of the replacement brush heads and the backing that&#x27;s on this model&#x27;s brush head.  It&#x27;s recommended that you replace the head every 6 months, but I prefer to replace mine every 3 months or so.  And the backing on it tends to trap stuff in it (such as lip balm, if you happen to be wearing it when brushing your teeth), which is very difficult to clean out.  That&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;d want to upgrade to one of the higher-end models, because the brush heads don&#x27;t have that plastic backing behind the brush itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would recommend this brush to just about everyone.  If you don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits, this brush will definitely help you out; and if you already have great dental hygiene, this is only a bonus!</li>
            <li> This model, which replaces the Advance 4000, does not have the essential pause feature to signal quadrant change in the 2-minute cycle. I sent it back to Phillips when they wouldn&#x27;t replace it with a model that does.</li>
            <li> This is My seccont Soniccare Tooth Brush. My trips to the Dentist have been much More of A Pleasure to go to the Dentist. &lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use and is very user Friendly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The sonicare 4100 tooth brush is one of the best on the market today with an affordable price. I highly reccomend this brush for cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> I had one of the older Sonicare Advance models before the Elite came out.  Great toothbrush.  In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   I am really glad I made the change.  While even the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now, I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  There are, however, lots of other features which make the Elite a  better brush.  Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning. The first time I used my old Sonicare I was amazed.  I had a similar reaction when I upgraded to the Elite.  It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  While the Elite also requires cleaning, it seems that the seal that separates the base of the head from the arm holding the bristles seals much better. Definitely a cleaner medicine cabinet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One hundred dollars seems like a lot for a toothbrush.  However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  If you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare, order one today.  If you can afford a few more dollars, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite model.  It is a wonderful product! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> A Sonicare is totally worth the price you pay, although I don&#x27;t feel you don&#x27;t need anything more than the basic model. I tried the one with the Quadrapacer but found no need for it. When my last Sonicare died and I went for a few weeks using a standard toothbrush (because I was price shopping), my gums got sore! BTW, Amazon had the best deal! I had problem teeth and gums until I purchased my first Sonicare at the suggestion of my dentist. I now get compliments on my teeth when I go in for my 6 month check up. I am on my third Sonicare. They only last about 3-5 years. If you leave them plugged in all of the time they last longer.</li>
            <li> I am on my second Sonicare and I got my first when I was pregnant with my 10 year old!  Cleans great!  People speak of the cost.  This is cheap compared to the investment in dental work if not used.  These don&#x27;t even compare to a regular tooth brush.  Make the investment in your teeth and you will be thankful.</li>
            <li> I already had the Sonic Elite but my dentist recommended I start using the older Advance model because it has a larger and deeper penetrating head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that keeps me from giving this model 5 stars is that the 2 minute timer does not provide the 30 second interval warnings that the Elite does.  Otherwise it is great!!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare has been highly recommended by our dentist (and also by our family orthodontist for our children.)  Our dentist recommends throwing out regular toothbrushes and using only the Sonicare for better protection of teeth and gums!   We found the best price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I instantly noticed my teeth being less \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; after using this it.      It takes some getting used to, versus a standard brush; if you don&#x27;t keep your lips sealed while brushing, it splatters toothpaste all over.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used a Sonicare was years ago and I loved it.  I was sharing the base with my boyfriend so we just had seperate brush heads that we would attach when it was our turn to use it.  I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for about 2 years and when I finally went, they said my teeth and gums were perfect! Then the bf had to get kicked to the curb--he took his sonicare with him. :(  I actually missed the sonicare more than him!  I wanted to go out and buy my own but they were very pricey.  So all these years I have wanted one.  Since I stopped using the sonicare, my teeth and comes have gone to hell in a handbag.  My gums are incredibly receded and I ALWAYS have cavaties.  Finally I searched on Amazon and found one at the right price (finally cheaper after 4 years) and bought it!   I love it so much and I pray it will get my mouth back in shape.  It already seems to be doing so after just a few weeks.  You will love it too.</li>
            <li> A basic Sonicare at a good price - it gets the job done. Just had a dental check up and the gums and teeth are in good shape despite not flossing.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I buy an electric toothbrush.    The 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush is quite effective in giving my teeth and gums that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling (and at preventing gingivitis).    It also helped that this item was selling at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I doubted that the Sonicare was all that great, but I dare you to try it. Don&#x27;t just buy the single bursh, buy the family set. You will be very pleased. I had some build-up and discoloration due to wearing braces. My teeth are whiter than ever. I am 51 years old and was afraid of what the braces would do to my teeth, but not anymore. I have a year left to wear them and I feel great about how my teeth will look after the braces come off.</li>
            <li> I hope that mcnair didn&#x27;t discard the toothbrush before giving it enough time.  We returned from a two-month trip and mine took about two weeks to recover; unfortunately my husband&#x27;s didn&#x27;t survive.  He took it apart and one of the ni-cad batteries was dead and beyond recovery.  The manual gives instructions for battery removal but only to recycle, not replace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does a great job of cleaning teeth and keeping the gums healthier (imho).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for years, and it still works great. I Justus buy the replacement heads and I&#x27;m good to go. This has been a god send to me, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without mine.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with our Sonicare Advance 4100. Since we had used Sonicare for the past 5-6 years when it quit, we wanted another one. I had just bought new brushes for our old one so that entered into the decision to buy this model so I could use them.  The price was right at Amazon.  The Advance 4100 lets you know when you have brushed 2 minutes although it doesn&#x27;t do the 30 second beeps like our first one.  Miss that.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My mom had used this model for 2 years before I asked her to purchase one for me. I was nervous to use an electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I made the switch. The very first time I used this toothbrush, I could see an instant change in the appearance of my teeth and gumline. I cannot compare this product with others (since is the first and only one I have used) but I can say that with each and every use, this brush delivers the most thorough cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had outside of the dentist&#x27;s office. I would definitely recommend this specific product to anyone looking to switch to an electric toothbrush - while I have not spent much time researching other models, this one seems to be one of the more reasonably priced (for what you get) and delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li> it is my first time to use sonicare. it is totally different than other brands i have used. it feels very good and give you a fresh feeling of mouth every day.</li>
            <li> NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS PROCDUCT EXCEPT IF YOU NEED ONE, GET IT.  IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY WITH GUM PROBLEMS.  THIS IS MY SECOND ADVANCE 4100.  THE LAST ONE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 14 YEARS BEFORE IT DIED.</li>
            <li> I already owned a Sonicare 4100 and it has been a very reliable and effective tool.  When traveling to my second home, I brought the toothbrush but forgot the charger so I decided to get a second one.  The Amazon price was very good and shipping was free so I ordered.  The new 4100 is exactly as good as my earlier 4100 except that I was unaware that it comes either with or without the feature to let you know when each 30 seconds of the 2 minute cycle is up.  My old one has this feature, the new one does not.  That was a minor disappointment as I thought I was buying exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these that I have had, the first on lasted about 8-10 years. the battery finally gave out and I bought this 4100. I is the same as the old one except the charging base is a little better.     I think it is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years. This is my 2nd and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Great product and it arrived within the timeframe they promised.</li>
            <li> Not having dental insurance I make sure I take very good care of my teeth and this product can&#x27;t be beat.  My teeth became whiter, my mouth feels \\&quot;happy\\&quot; after using it and my dentist is delighted when he sees the results.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  Regardless of the two-year limited warranty the last one lasted me over eight years.  I can&#x27;t say this one will last that long, or that yours will, but even if it was only a fluke it&#x27;s obvious they make a sturdy product.</li>
            <li> The Advance 4100 has been the best toothbrush I have ever used, and still using. For some time now I&#x27;ve spent a fortune buying cheap imitations thinking it&#x27;s the same as a pricier toothbrush the likes of Sonicare. The difference is night and day, the Sonicare is worth every penny. Replacement for the brush heads are easy to find in almost any major general store. The timer on here is very useful in maintaining a good brushing routine. The only bad thing I would say about the product is that there is no way you can find out if the battery is almost out, unless you keep track of how much it&#x27;s used before it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> Makes the teeth feel cleaner than any brush I have ever used. Looking forward to seeing if the dental hygienist sees a difference. Holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Have had this for years finally ordered one for my wife. We love them. Replacement heads are pricey though.</li>
            <li> This item keeps the kids brushing really well.  Love how this works. Makes it easy with the built in timer.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun  electric toothbrush since the mid 90s.  I needed a replacement due to battery power loss over 5 or 6 years.  I saw a special on the Sonicare 4100 in the Golden Box and decided to try it.  I am sticking with the Phillips from now on!  It works smoother than the Braun with less vibration, so there is less enamel ware.  It really did whiten my teeth as they claim!  Comfortable to hold and use.  Auto shutoff after two minutes.  Easy to clean up and keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is no warning when 15 seconds is up, just the 2 minute shutoff.  The Braun gives a 15 second warning.  It is probably there in the more expensive models.  Although it is still light, it is heaver than the Braun.  The replacement heads are much more expensive than the Braun, since they contain gears and are larger.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush, it&#x27;s my second one the first lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> This was on special so I tried it and I have to say it&#x27;s wonderful. My teeth are cleaner and the backs of the teeth, which is hard to get clean the old way, are better. When I went to the dentist, they had brouchures about this exact model. You have to get used to the sensation, and it ramps up a little more each time in the beginning. And I actually use this in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to worry about making a little mess with toothpaste in or out of my mouth. I&#x27;m really glad I use it and it does work and it works well.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.  Just the two minute timer on it alone adds to the experience.  I was proud to visit my dentist after using this and a dental waterpik.  Can be a bit \\&quot;ticklish\\&quot; at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Have used the sonicare since 1997 - could not ask for a better product.  The older ones are great, the newer models are fantastic.  It is worth the cost of purchase.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the virtues of this product.</li>
            <li> Good deal.Very good deal and you can&#x27;t beat ultrasonic for getting your teeth clean.Doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles of other brushes but for the price you can&#x27;t miss.</li>
            <li> It does not work with 220 V.  I burned it out and had to replace it with the newer version that automatically adjusts between 110 and 220.</li>
            <li> was very happy with this.  I no longer have this toothbrush as I lost it, but it was a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the very first generation of the Philips Sonicare line. The other ones are cheaply made. Have no idea why they even created other ones when the 4100 is the very best in show. Change the heads every 2-3 months and wash off the toothbrush after you use it. It has a nice little plastic cap on top of the bristles so you don&#x27;t get germs on the head when not in use. It cleans your teeth perfectly and has a nice feel weight wise. Thanks for keeping this one alive.</li>
            <li> It all the time. Huge fan. I have had it for years, no issues what so ever. I would suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li> Keep it on the charger and have it always plugged in and charging. Dry it with a towel after use, place it back on the charger stand. Keep it where it will stay dry. Mine is like brand new. I love this Sonicare. I received it as a gift in 2001.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush.  Once I used this, I didn&#x27;t want to try any others.  It has a 2 minute timer for brushing your teeth.  I change the brush every 6 months.  I found my gums don&#x27;t get sore any more as a bonus.  And when I go to the dentist for checkups, cleaning is easier.</li>
            <li> Had one for years.  I liked it so much that  when it  died I figured why  not get the same model as a replacement !!!!</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush I have used this brand for years.  I needed to replace the one I had for many years.</li>
            <li> First off, the Sonicare absolutely helps enormously with keeping tartar at bay.  I always get gold or platinum stars from my hygienist.  Of course, I floss daily, as well.  The first Sonicare I ever bought lasted exactly one year before it died.  I was pretty disappointed and didn&#x27;t buy another until a few years later.  I did not keep the handle on the charger and it usually sat in the shower unless it needed charging.  The second Sonicare finally died on me recently.  It lasted seven years  and through two deployments to Iraq!  I always stored the handle on the charger and never let it discharge.  I can&#x27;t explain it&#x27;s longevity; it simply goes against common rechargeable battery protocol.  I&#x27;m currently shopping for another Sonicare.  I will buy the cheapest model I can find since I know it will clean my teeth as well or better than an expensive model.</li>
            <li> worked great, fast shipping, thank you very much</li>
            <li> IT cleans well, and tickles at first but i think overall this is a sweet cleaner....</li>
            <li> My dentist has been trying to sell me one of theses for years, at $125 and I thought he was full of it. But now after using mine for a month I am very impressed. Of course I bought it from Amazon and paid much less. This one might not have all the bells and whistles, but it is a great toothbrush. I am looking forward to my next checkup, I know I have much less plaque.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my dental hygeinist and frankly was skeptical about it at the time of purchase.  I had tried an Interplak brush years ago at the advice of another hygeinist and was disappointed with it.  I kind of expected the same disappointment with the Sonicare but I decided to give it a try anyway.  My skepticism turned to surprise and pleasure after the first use.  I could immediately tell that this tooth brush was for real.  I actually felt like I had just gotten out of the dentist&#x27;s chair each time I brushed.  I could go on and on about this product but will avoid all of the rambling and details and simply say \\&quot;buy it\\&quot;.  This is a good product.  I have recommended it to everyone I work with and four co-workers have purchased them and all of them are as pleased with it as I am.  If it breaks I will get another one even if the price has doubled.  It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I suffered gum problems for years. My teeth would bleed every single time I brushed them. Dentist recommended Sonic Care Toothbrush and my gums have been healthy ever since. I used to brush hard and, that must have been part of the problem. Sonic uses a gentle massage but, it cleans and protects your teeth. It also massages gums which, allow remaining food to be released. It is a great tooth brush. I had my first one for 5 years and just bought a new one (for a great price at Amazon). Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> ... some people get their home burglarized and then develop a roll of film that shows their toothbrushes in a burglar&#x27;s butt? You wouldn&#x27;t do that with this toothbrush if it was on. It vibrates like crazy. And who uses rolls of film anymore? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have had this product since August 6th (according to the email from Amazon I just discovered in my spam folder which suggested that I review the toothbrush) and I have the same number of teeth that I did when I purchased it. This is optimal in a toothbrush. Superficially, \\&quot;more teeth\\&quot; sounds more positive, but we all know that technically shouldn&#x27;t happen. Unless I was under 13 or something. But I&#x27;m not and I am about to tick a box promising that.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare Advance in 1999 and am still using it! The original company was Sonicare and independantly owned. They were bought out by Philips and if you read the box on the new brushes you&#x27;ll see its a Philips Elec. product now! Since then I&#x27;ve bought 3 others and have had 2 fail in around 2 years. Yes they are the Philips products. I took the last one apart and saw that the batteries are NiCad and therefore are NOT the lastest technology which is NiMH or Nickel metal hydride. You notice the battery powered tool Manufacturers and Electronice Manufacturers are going to that technology(as well as litium ion). For the price of these brushes I think we deserve a better grade of battery!</li>
            <li> To make it brief....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the slick feeling your teeth get just after going to a dentist for a routine cleaning every 6 months??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well everytime you brush in less than 2 minutes you will have the same feeling. Teeth will honestly get cleaner than ever. And your gums get healthier as they are massaged and cleaned from the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled, those other electronic toothbrushes don&#x27;t come close, they just vibrate your hand till its numb and leaving your teeth not nearly as clean as with a sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare, my dentist recommended it for my gums and there was such an improvement!  No other electric brush work like this or better than this.  BUY ONE!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was glad to fiind it as the local stores had more expensive replacements with more stuff than I needed.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product, too bad the brushes cost almost half the cost of the product and there is no replacement battery. When the battery stops charging you throw away one expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over 10 years.  My first one just died and I replaced it with a like model.  The more expensive models do have more features, but the basic model cleans just as well for less than half the price of the top-of-line model.  Before I purchased my first Sonicare, I had been diagnosed as being in the early stages of peridontal disease and my dentist recommended I try one.  My teeth and gums are in better shape than ever!</li>
            <li> For the price this toothbrush is the best for removing tartar and plaque without having to struggle. It works well when used properly ask your dentist or hygenist you will be surprised on the basic tips that can save you time in the chair.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I have purchased, the first lasting about 3 years.  My dental health has never been better than when I started using Sonicare.  I recommend it highly to all to maintain healthy gums, teeth and good dental checkups.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!! Everyone should have one.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was a replacement for one that had been lost.  It arrived in very timely fashion.  I am very pleased with the Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush that&#x27;s great for its price and reputation.  No complaints on my end.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve used. My original one wore out in 5 years. Not bad considering how much I use it. I replace the head every two months.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare finally crapped out and I needed a new one.  I saw this one on Amazon, which is exactly like my old one.  Sure they have \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; ones now, but they basically do the same thing and cost almost twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best bet for the money.  It works great and keeps my teeth clean and shiny between visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have gotten. They last a long time. My other one was 5 years old. It is great. I love how clean it gets my teeth. Since I have had one and have made an effort to also floss nightly, I have not had any cavities. Definitely takes the stress out of visiting the dentist...and I have had many cavities in my lifetime.     This time I bought 3 sonicare toothbrushes, One for me and I gave them as presents to my sister and boyfriend. They love them too. My sister has gum disease and she says it is making a huge difference and my boyfriend uses smokeless tobacco and he also says it is helping. Says his teeth feel clean even right after waking up.     Definitely recommend the sonicare toothbrush! But if you can get the one with the quadpacer. My original one had it, this ones does not. It just beeps to tell you when to move to the next area of your mouth, doesn&#x27;t sound important but it does help.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the one with the timer that lets you know when you change sides, but it wasn&#x27;t. Still, it isn&#x27;t a bad toothbrush. The biggest problem these things have is that bases die eventually, and then you have to buy a new one. If you can find a similar one that takes batteries you can switch out, go for it.</li>
            <li> My sonicare 4100 died after 3 years use, so I needed to replace  it. Went to drug and discount stores and the best price I saw was   $99 to $119 for sonicare toothbrushes. Checked Amazon and got a great price and it was here in three days.[[ASIN:B00008BFXG Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after hearing other people&#x27;s recommendations and TV ads.  After using this toothbrush for about 6 months, I&#x27;m done with it.  After brushing with it I feel like I need to brush again.  I get better results with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very messy.  In the trash it goes.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Oral B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only good thing about it is that it stimulates your gums really well because of the vibration, but unfortunately a toothbrush needs to do more than just that.</li>
            <li> I had been using one of those $5 battery toothbrushes for years. I always brushed 2 min in fact I had a route I walked my house so as to brush long enough turns out I was brushing 3 min. LOL Now with this toothbrush it times the 2 min for me, I still walk. My teeth feel so clean just like I came from the dentist. One big thing I noticed Is I floss after brushing and there would always be some little somthing that the floss caught. Now there is NOTHING from the floss. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush. It was a great value and I wish I had gotten it sooner. I&#x27;m a fanatic about keeping clean teeth and at my last checkup didn&#x27;t even have to have a cleaning as there was no plaque or tartar to clean. I cannot wait to see what my dentist says this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con to the product is the packaging. If you have bad arthritis in your hands you may have trouble getting the package open. Inside the box the unit is sealed in that hard molded plastic. very hard to cut open and then the sharp plastic cut my hand. traditional cardboard dividers would have done just as well. I just mention this as if you are alone with no one to help you it can be difficult.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great. It makes your teeth whitter in no time. And it also makes your mouth feel fresh and clean. You look forward to using it everyday. The only negative is the sound, it takes some getting use to. It&#x27;s a wierd buzzing sound. Other than that, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> I got this a birthday present for my and she loves it. She said her teeth eel smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> Best sonic toothbrush on the market.  Far superior to the newer Sonicare series, which have brushes too small for a normal sized male mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I was the only one left in my apartment who didn&#x27;t have one. Both of my room mates swear by their electric toothbrushes an after a little research I decided on this one.  For the price (it was on the lower side of the ones I looked at) it is amazing.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently at all, and so far it has proven to be very durable- it has been dropped off the sink several times and still works as good as the day I got it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! My dentist noticed my healthy gums after using it for a short period of time. In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the brushing feel however now I would not want to go back to a regular toothbrush. I have recently bought my second one after having my first one for approximately 7 years. I replace my brush heads  2-3 times a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second of the Advance Sonicare electric toothbrushes and when this one goes, I&#x27;ll buy another.  My first lasted about eight years and I&#x27;ve had this second one for over a year.  Newer, sleeker models come and go, but I&#x27;ve found that this is solid in the hand, easy to depress the single button, and I like the thicker base than many others on the market.  I prefer the standard brush rather than the compact, but I bet a smaller mouth may prefer the compact size.  I&#x27;m used to my routine and when I switch for the smaller size, I long for the standard size.  If you&#x27;re worried about the 2 minute timer not being enough, then simply press the button again and you&#x27;re good to go.  To preserve the life and sanitary conditions of the brush head, I pour boiling water over the brush every week or two and I also remove the entire head, clean it out, then wipe it down with alcohol.  I find the brushes last for well over 3 months for me and tend to replace them only after 6 months or more.  This brush also works great on the gums which is a very important part of dental hygiene.  I brush my tongue without the power because I prefer doing that very gently a couple times as opposed to the \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; done by this small appliance.  Amazon also offers competitive pricing on the single replacement brushes, so you don&#x27;t need to leave home to search when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> We really like these soniccare products, but replaced the first one because it quit working after 4 years, whic isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were disappointed with this one because it didn&#x27;t have the divided timer option: Our first one would beep every quarter of the run time so you could gauge how much time to spend in each section of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We replaced it after a few years because we had trouble finding replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our new one is great (it has the smaller heads) and the timer beeps every quarter plus it has an option to run/brush longer.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my Dentist. I bought one for myself and my wife. I have since purchaser extra heads for ours and bought one for each of our married daughters and their husbands. Everyone loves them. And they keep your gums felling great. THANKS Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> This a great toothbrush, and really helps to clean teeth well, stimulate gums for good health, get between the teeth and everything you want in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years and really liked how it worked before it finally died and I was unable to change the battery because it was too hard to pry the handle apart without breaking it so I was forced to buy another one... I bought this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than the other ones. The only disadvantage is that this model doesn&#x27;t prompt you to change brushing zones every 30 seconds like the more expensive ones do, which can be a bit annoying if you don&#x27;t have a clock next to your sink. Otherwise, it does the same job as my older model. It all comes down to if you want that 30-second prompt, paying up to 20 more bucks or not.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these. Arrived in good time and is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare lasted about 2 years and had to be replaced since the batteries wouldn&#x27;t charge. Since it was dead anyway, I took it apart (with a chisel--the case is glued together) and found the usual two AA NiCad batteries inside.  Since the circuitry inside must be broken to get at the batteries, they&#x27;re not replaceable and thus it&#x27;s basically a disposible toothbrush. Sonicare should be ashamed for designing a product that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the device was solidly built and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous!  I have everyone in my family and extended family using this toothbrush.  My dentist recommended it to me and to all his patients.  I hardly had to sit for my last cleaning.  And the price is the best on Amazon.com.  I love Amazon.com for DVDs and books and now appliances.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand toothbrush for the last 8yrs. I love how it works and makes my teeth feel, my first one broke. So I purchased the same exact one again. My checkups have also improved since I have used this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this sonicare toothbrush on the advice of my dental hygeinist. &lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums never felt better. I can hardly wait for my next dental check up. I&#x27;m buying a sonicare toothbrush for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for about 5 years now, and cannot imagine using anything else!  I just purchased 3 more to give to my nieces for Christmas.  I am 50 years old, have absolutely no problem with my teeth or gums, and I give the credit to Sonicare!  That used to be an issue for me - but no more.  I am not a \\&quot;flosser\\&quot;, and the first time I went to have my teeth cleaned after using the toothbrush for several months, they were amazed at the lack of placque on my teeth!  Where I had always had to go every 6 months, they now only see me once a year.  And my hygienist never fails to comment on how clean my teeth are!  I highly, highly recomment this product!  I take in when I travel - it keeps its charge for at least a week - never tried longer than that.  And in the rare case I have gotten stuck away from home unexpectedly and had to use a plain toothbrush, I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth when I get home so they feel clean!  I love it and can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li> Whether you get the basic model, or the elite, nothing else works better.  This is my second model, as the battery finally quite in the old model after 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have four people in my family and we each have one.  I wouln&#x27;t use any other toothbrush.  We have tried other power toothbrushes but they don&#x27;t compare.  My parents also use Sonic 4100.  Definitely Recommend!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonic toothbrush before and it was great!  This one, however, doesn&#x27;t have 2 important features:  the 30-second interval indicator so that you can cover all 4 quadrants of your teeth; and and low battery indicator.  Pay the additional $$ and get those features--they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> i have used this company&#x27;s product for many years and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this electric toothbrush would have a 30-second alert like my previous Sonicare toothbrush so I could spend equal time on each quadrant in my mouth.  Unfortunately, it does not.  I wish I had know this beforehand.  I would have looked elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these 6 years ago. Mine worked great for about 4 years, then one of the two handles stopped holding a charge. Then two years later the second handle stopped holding a charge. I now get 10 seconds of brushing out of the handle and have gone back to normal toothbrushing until I decide which electric toothbrush I&#x27;m going to buy next. It will definitely be a Sonicare. No cavities in 6 years with noticeably cleaner teeth even with a high daily coffee intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering purchasing the 4100, I would recommend against it versus the newer models. The older 4100 has a lot more crevices (holding bacteria) and is a lot thicker (making it more difficult to reach the back of the mouth) than the newer models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes are the way to go, but recognize that the handles are not designed to last forever and you will have to replace the heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Sonicare brushes approximately 2 1/2 years ago. They worked great but one of them decided to not hold a charge.  I am quite disappointed as I thought I could just replace the battery.  I paid almost $90.00 and did not get the life expectancy I thought I would.</li>
            <li> After eight years of not going to the dentist, I finally booked an appointment at the local dental school.  My student dentist had hoped to use my cleaning as an example for her supervisor, unfortunately for her I had been using the Sonicare 4100 for those eight years.  My teeth had so little plaque on them that I wasn&#x27;t eligible to be used as the example.  While I do floss, it is not on a daily basis, but this tooth brush kept plague down even between my teeth.  Prior to this visit, eight years earlier, my former dentist had recommended getting the Sonicare, because I was developing receding gums (from brushing too hard) and had some minor gingivitis and plaque build up.  My checkup proved that her recommendation was a good one, because my gums are healthy, no gingivitis and you know about the plaque already.  As for the comments on the 2 minute timer.  Two minutes is the time designated as the optimum time for brushing.  While one reviewer may not need the timer, and the other feels that 2 minutes is too short, I&#x27;d suggest that you time yourself to see how long you actually brush for.  Most people will be surprised how short it is.  The timer allows you to properly pace yourself for maximum benefit.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this system.  While it is a bit pricey for replacement heads, it is a decent trade off for the dental health it provides.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000YOZJXK Philips Sonicare HX4101 Advance 4100 Sonic Toothbrush]]    It was a replacement for the old one I had for some 10 years and the new one works even better than the old one when it was new!!</li>
            <li> To keep from splattering while brushing it&#x27;s recommended to keep your mouth closed around this brush. Because of the size of the brush head &amp; short neck that&#x27;s impossible if you have a small mouth. I also find it very loud, difficult to use, overall a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace an 8 year old Sonicare Advance.  This model is inexpensive and very similar to our original model, but I miss the quadrapace feature.  Just hope this lasts as long as the original one.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had been using an ordinary manual toothbrush, and my checkups were good, but not great. My dentist said the Sonicare is the best for the teeth and gums, and I agree. Mine have never felt cleaner. I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting my next appointment to see if my pockets have gotten smaller.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used SoniCare for our toothbrush - bought our first one in 1994. Well - this year the toothbrush finally died - no longer held a charge. Ours was the only SoniCare model sold at the time we bought it - it worked VERY well for a very long time. We changed brush heads every six months, we kept the unit well cleaned. We really loved the heft of the base unit and the 30 second beeps.&lt;br /&gt;So we ordered another \\&quot;basic\\&quot; (to get the HEAVIER base - we did not like the lighter weight model with those SKINNY brush heads). This SoniCare arrived a week after we ordered it - well packaged - all items in tact.  We &#x27;pluged&#x27; in the charger - charged the brush unit 24 hours - and then - proceeded to use it.&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETELY CHANGED - - - now, NO 30 SECOND BEEP - the unit does work for the entire two minutes, but gone is the very handy 30 second timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe we will change to the Braun Oral-B when this piece of dreck dies. It&#x27;s not pleasant spending a weeks grocery money on a toothbrush - and then discovering that the &#x27;trusted&#x27; company decided to make a few pennies more per item and killed the 30 second timer on &#x27;low-end&#x27; items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Phillips/SoniCare!!!!!!! (Sure hope those few pennies saved make up for the LONG time customers you are going to lose.)</li>
            <li> It really works, belive it or not.  My dentist say I have 0 plag...  Otto</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Teeth really feel clean after use.  Really love it and will definitely get another if and when this one gives out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this toothbrush.  My teeth feel soooo clean after each brushing.  The timer on the brush assures I brush long enough.  It&#x27;s too easy with a regular toothbrush to shortcut the brushing.  Got this on the Deal of the Day for $40 with free shipping - great price.  Replacement brushes are a little pricey but I will shop for deals on those as well.  I&#x27;m confident my teeth and gums will benefit greatly from continued use of this product.  I definitely recommend the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Sonicare literally saved my teeth!  I was told, over 10 years ago, by 3 different dentists that I would lose all of my teeth to gum &amp; bone disease.  That scared me into spending the money on the Sonicare toothbrush.  As of today, I have NOT lost any teeth and my gums are healthier than ever.  I have had the same base for my Sonicare for the past 10 years.  I keep it plugged in and keep the brush/handle in the unit at all times.  Sonicare may seem pricey, AND how can you put a price on your teeth and gums?  I recommend this toothbrush to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago with great reluctance. Ordinarily, I spend about one dollar on a toothbrush. Replaced monthly, that&#x27;s 12 dollars a year. So the cost put me off.    On the other hand, I had my first cavities filled in two decades last year, and that wasn&#x27;t inexpensive (or fun) either. And no matter how much I brushed and flossed, every visit my hygienist gave me a bad time about tartar build up and gum problems.    So I took the plunge.    I used it about 3 months prior to my next dental appointment, and did not say a word about it. My hygienist noticed a big difference and was effusive about how well I was taking care of my teeth. So I guess this vibrator with a brush on the end is not all hype!    I&#x27;ve followed the advice of reviewers who report long product life: I only place it in the charger when it needs charging, and then I charge it for 24 hours. I&#x27;m hoping to get five years out of it.    The only problem I encountered was increased sensitivity to cold - this went away when I reduced the use to once a day. Other brushings I use a regular toothbrush.    Also, it is probably not a good idea for most of us to use toothpastes with silica \\&quot;whiteners\\&quot; with a brush like this - you don&#x27;t want to remove your enamel, just the plaque!    So, my opinion is that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I entirely buy their claims about whitening and such, but it does a decent job of keeping my teeth clean in-between regular dental cleanings. Definitely better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am very satisfied that my teeth and gums will be healthier. My husband also has one. He influenced me to purchase the same one as his. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Ever since getting a Sonicare about 10 years ago, I have had excellent dental exams.  These brushes make brushing fun.  The special price by Amazon allowed me to get everyone in my family one.</li>
            <li> I initially received this toothbrush as a birthday gift from my husband and I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.  But now I am thrilled.  My teeth are cleaner, my dentist is happier, and once you use this toothbrush you will never want to go back to a manual again.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted less than a year, brush replacements are bulkier &amp; more complicated than need be and are too expensive</li>
            <li> This purchase is a replacement for one of similar model we used for many years. It does not \\&quot;beep\\&quot; for each quadrant of the mouth but it does do an excellent job of cleaning teeth and ensuring that you brush for the right length of time.</li>
            <li> Received in good time and happy with product. This is the second one I have bought. The first lasted about 9 years before the battey case deteriorated from the charging heat.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews complaining about the short battery life of the Sonicare toothbrushes. I have two of the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes. One lost all battery life within one year. The other lost all battery life within two years. I emailed Philips Sonicare and they had me call customer service to resolve the problem. I called and here is the solution that they gave me:    1. Put the toothbrush on the recharge stand and hold the power button in for 5-7 seconds until you hear/feel two beeps. Release the power button. Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand.  2. Hold the power button in again until you hear/feel one beep. Release the power button.  3. Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand for 24 hrs.     This process will reset and recharge the battery.    Other than the battery problem they have been superb toothbrushes.    Update: The above procedure did not work. Sonicare says that I need to replace the toothbrush and suggested that I buy a more expensive product. Until they solve the problems with their batteries I will not by another Sonicare product. It&#x27;s a shame. Other than the battery problems they are superb toothbrushes.     Based on this new information, instead of the original 5 star rating that I gave Sonicare, I now give Sonicare a 2 star rating since I do not believe that the value for the dollar spent is there.</li>
            <li> Had my first Advance 4100 about 3.5 years and it just died. I had assumed it would last much longer. I am quite certain the technology to do so is available because I knew people that bought theirs ten or fifteen years ago and theirs are still going strong. The product was great - - while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, Sonicare was using cheaper batteries (and making the unit so they cannot be replaced). Why? To try to get you to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;new&#x27; models. The head is thinner and more flimsy. That&#x27;s so they can claim a new &#x27;slant head&#x27; innovation. Why? To try to get you to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even when I bought mine 3.5 years ago, I noticed they had models ranging from $50 to $150. For the extra $100 you got several nearly worthless features (beeping reminders, a cheap plastic travel case). That tells me the thing basically can sell for $50 and they still make a wad of cash. Then I started seeing $30 models on the shelf, using disposable batteries. Hmmmm. They delete the charger, probably built it much cheaper so it would die even sooner, dropped the price somewhat and likely get an even higher profit margin. Lovely. Why did they go to the lower price point? To sell one to all the people who couldn&#x27;t swing $50. Then once they are addicted, they will buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So remember, before you plop down $150 for one with a slew of worthless add-ons that you probably don&#x27;t need, remember the company can make the same thing and sell it all day long for $30 and still turn a tidy profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, Amaz. had the old Advance 4100 model here (and almost no one else did) for $45 and so I did buy another one. Because the product does do what it is supposed to do, and it does it reasonably well. Over the last ten-fifteen years, every dental professional I knew preferred Sonicare over \\&quot;Aural-B.\\&quot; And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in owning this first Advance 4100 (except for its untimely demise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when this new one dies and all the old stock of the Advance 4100 model is gone, I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying the one with the flimsy thin slanted head. It obviously won&#x27;t provide the same quality. And since Sonicare is clearly establishing a pattern of going on the cheap and cheaper, inventing new models to obsolete the old models, and doing whatever they can to get you to keep buying new toothbrushes, I can only figure that when this new one eventually shuts down, whatever Sonicare has on the market then will be little more than worthless c**p. The genius management will have probably taken the $30 model down to a $10 disposable version that only vibrates about half the time and dies within a month. And they&#x27;ll be wondering why it doesn&#x27;t sell anymore like it did in the good ol&#x27; days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When is the corporate world going to realize there&#x27;s not enough money out there for all of them to endlessly s***w the public out of outrageous markups, multiple purchases, downsized pacakges at higher prices, and whatnot? When will they start cutting out some of their infinitely bloated profit margins and overhead expenses? When enough of them go broke, I suppose. Then the rest will realize the party is over. Realize that you can only make but so much money selling a toothbrush (or a can of dog food or a cigarette lighter or whatever)  ... and that if management turns it into a piece of c**p through cost-cutting, well, people will stop buying it altogether. Now that doesn&#x27;t require a Harvard MBA now does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can still recommend this Advance 4100 unit, even though I won&#x27;t be surprised if it dies even quicker than the first one. After that, though, I&#x27;ll be cross-shopping the heck out of this puppy.l is gone, I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying the one with the flimsy thin slanted head.

            <li> I ordered a new Sonicare toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare that gave up the ghost after 11 years.  It came in the stated time, arrived in great condition and I&#x27;m still enjoying using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old Sonicare toothbrush just died. RIP. I  have always been amazed with this product. I bought it at Costco sometime in the late 1990s. I have never had any trouble with it. I always left it in the charger stand. The length of time it would hold a charge went down over the years, but it functioned perfectly all this time. And I&#x27;m not ever sure it was the toothbrush. It might be the charger that went belly up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt Phillips has built some planned obsolesce into their latest models, but I will be replacing my Sonicare with another Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  I wore the old one out after 6 or so years and was glad to find another of the same.</li>
            <li> Still using this after purchasing in May, 2009. This should tell something about this products. It was built to last and works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Lik all Sonicare tooth brushes, this model does a great job.  Problem is the replacement heads cost almost as much as the unit.  We have another Sonicare model that uses the small replacement heads that cost 1/3rd as much.  I would recommend those models over this type.</li>
