            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>And if she&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried it.</li>
            <li>Great color and coverage.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Good foundation.  </li>
            <li>quite this good a price, but still cheaper than stores, even Walmart,</li>
            <li>and it was of good quality.</li>
            <li>Great makeup but be sure and check the expiration date when you purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I love this makeup!</li>
            <li>This goes on so easy and it looks great.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to try shaking the tube and after that, the makeup came out a perfect color and blends beautifully on my skin- makes my skin look better but not still natural.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who want light coverage with a bit of sun protection.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>I purchased this foundation with high hopes because I can NEVER find a foundation to match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price and its a great shade.</li>
            <li>I love Almay products since more birthdays seem to bring more allergies.</li>
            <li>Even if the color had been perfect, coverage wasn&#x27;t enough and it didn&#x27;t seem to set on my face even with a finishing powder.</li>
            <li>my friends love it too</li>
            <li>Allay CC cream works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Love the  makeup goes on easy and blends in well will get more when out  </li>
            <li>Great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also feels light, which I love.  </li>
            <li>But it is light coverage</li>
            <li>This foundation does not have a smell to it and is quite light, not cakey.  </li>
            <li>My skin is light</li>
            <li>I got this because it said it would work for light skin.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re really light skinned, I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using Almay Smart Shade Makeup for several years and was so excited to find this excellent price.</li>
            <li>Blends in quickly into the face</li>
            <li>My order was processed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a very light coverage, not heavy, if you don&#x27;t need to cover a lot of flaws.</li>
            <li>Light but enough coverage and good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m naturally flushed most of the time.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of coverage unless you perform on a stage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to worry about my makeup being the right shade.</li>
            <li>and I love how it is white</li>
            <li>Better price than locally - wish I could subscribe!  </li>
            <li>Not as much coverage as I need now that I&#x27;m getting older!</li>
            <li>and it really does adjust to match your face.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first on my wrist, then on my face and both colors were exactly the same and did not match my face at all.</li>
            <li>it just gives you the illusion of &#x27;color adjusting&#x27; but really, you&#x27;re picking your color when you pick light, light/medium, or dark.</li>
            <li>when I first opened the tube, it came out white</li>
            <li>Coverage is very sheer, but it really did match my skin tone, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I received the package in a timely manner, but both the packaging and the tube itself looked old and faded.</li>
            <li>She stilled looked kind of orange with it, but it didn&#x27;t look as weird as it did with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty pale girl, so I figured it would work well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product for those who want light coverage with a bit of sun protection.  Blends in quickly into the face and it really does adjust to match your face.  But it is light coverage so adds just a bit of finish.  For me, I wear this for both work and on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Not drying, not oily &amp; doesn&#x27;t settle into lines.  Just the right amount of coverage unless you perform on a stage.</li>
            <li> It is a very light coverage, not heavy, if you don&#x27;t need to cover a lot of flaws.</li>
            <li> I really like the Almay as it&#x27;s airy and doesn&#x27;t look heavy on your face. I have medium skin and have to mix the 200 and 300-- which they offered one that was inbetween!</li>
            <li> Good foundation.  Not as much coverage as I need now that I&#x27;m getting older!</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price and its a great shade. This goes on so easy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this and I love how it is white and then when you apply to your skin it changes to your shade. AMAZING</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> Coverage is very sheer, but it really did match my skin tone, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> It doesnt give any coverage at all..</li>
            <li> Great makeup but be sure and check the expiration date when you purchase it.  Great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage.</li>
            <li> And if she&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happy! Lol</li>
            <li> Light but enough coverage and good for sensitive skin.  I love Almay products since more birthdays seem to bring more allergies.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation with high hopes because I can NEVER find a foundation to match my skin perfectly. With my acne scars and redness it&#x27;s hard to match a foundation so I got this to do the matching for me. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to adjust color at all. I tried it first on my wrist, then on my face and both colors were exactly the same and did not match my face at all. I think because it comes out white it just gives you the illusion of &#x27;color adjusting&#x27; but really, you&#x27;re picking your color when you pick light, light/medium, or dark. Even if the color had been perfect, coverage wasn&#x27;t enough and it didn&#x27;t seem to set on my face even with a finishing powder. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup! It does the job and it costs a quarter of the price of Lancome which i used for over 20 years. My budget has changed and I give this a big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Just awful, sometimes it goes on way to dark. I don&#x27;t like it all. I don&#x27;t have time to worry about my makeup being the right shade. You have to wash your face and start over.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers complained about the makeup coming out chalk white or too dark- when I first opened the tube, it came out white so I was disappointed.  However, I decided to try shaking the tube and after that, the makeup came out a perfect color and blends beautifully on my skin- makes my skin look better but not still natural.  It also feels light, which I love.  I&#x27;ve always hated buying foundation because I get really confused by all the shades, so this is a great product for me.</li>
            <li> Love the  makeup goes on easy and blends in well will get more when out  my friends love it too</li>
            <li> Better price than locally - wish I could subscribe!  This foundation does not have a smell to it and is quite light, not cakey.  Does what it is supposed to by matching skin tone.</li>
            <li> I received the package in a timely manner, but both the packaging and the tube itself looked old and faded. The make up went on alright, but didn&#x27;t seem quite &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; - it looked as though it was &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; and perhaps taken off the shelf of some store and resold. Of course, it was cheaper, but still..... I have gotten this make up before at not quite this good a price, but still cheaper than stores, even Walmart, and it was of good quality. Not sure what happened this time.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin is light and I&#x27;m naturally flushed most of the time. When I apply the makeup to my cheeks, it turns pink. I&#x27;ve tried to make it work my combining it with other product, but that just causes other problems. Allay CC cream works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I got this because it said it would work for light skin. I&#x27;m a pretty pale girl, so I figured it would work well. Perhaps the fact that it would also cover medium skin should&#x27;ve turned me away, but I ordered anyway. It made my skin look orange and unnatural with the rest of my skin, so I stopped using it. My sister, whose skin is darker, loves it though. She stilled looked kind of orange with it, but it didn&#x27;t look as weird as it did with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re really light skinned, I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have been using Almay Smart Shade Makeup for several years and was so excited to find this excellent price. My order was processed and shipped quickly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
