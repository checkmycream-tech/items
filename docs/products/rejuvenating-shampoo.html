            <li>Each time the results were spectacular!  </li>
            <li>For the best results, I strongly recommend buying the shampoo, conditioning rinse (conditioner), repair mask, leave in conditioner, and oil.  </li>
            <li>I loved the size of this because I feel I can go for months without having to buy shampoo again.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo because I watch a lot of gurus saying that this was so good and so on.</li>

            <li>This is the best Shampoo I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li>love love love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>im soo happy very much</li>
            <li>i can tell the biggest difference in my hair! :)</li>
            <li>I find myself paying a legitimate price for the item, because it really makes your hair feel great, and it replenishes the scalp.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I needed a shampoo that was more moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I love this line.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo to pieces.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent ever, but it&#x27;s not gross-</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this is paraben and sulfate free!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I will continue in buying it.</li>
            <li>I love it this shampoo</li>
            <li>I love this product, The shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>However, when I went to rinse my hair, every tangle came out and my hair never felt better.</li>
            <li>i fell in love of how my hair felt and the scent of it.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo all the time&amp; love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is very fragrant &amp; my hair feels great after I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo ...</li>
            <li>The macadamia nourishes my hair, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I think I became more greedy</li>
            <li>I love the Macadamia hair mask, but I would&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great Shampoo for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I have bought this shampoo many times at Pure Beauty and loved it.</li>
            <li>its very good and very rinse thank you so much</li>
            <li>I am not super impressed because it seems like just shampoo.</li>
            <li>The end result is health, silky smooth manageable hair without all of the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Lathers well, leaves hair super clean!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It feels like my hair is so clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft, shiny &amp; more manageable!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and allows shorter drying time for my hair type which is needed as I have thick, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>If you need it fast , better look for it somewhere else..</li>
            <li>so the next day i had to purchase the Macadamia Shampoo and Conditioner and at that i bought a good size of it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I did then after the first use, I purchased the 33 oz bottles of everything!  </li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo, used it only once but already can see the improvement.</li>
            <li>it cleans my hair nicely without it feeling dry.</li>
            <li>so I recently bought the giant size of every macadamia product that I could find lol...</li>
            <li>You can wind up paying $20 more for this stuff in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on hair products.</li>
            <li>Lastly, Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than any I&#x27;ve found in any drugstore chain.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening!</li>
            <li>this was the first sulphate free shampoo i tried when i first became natural.</li>
            <li>Like the product &amp; now can justify purchase by spending less for more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fake it is the real product.</li>
            <li>I also use the moisturizing rinse, these leave my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Is drying but the real product is not.</li>
            <li>It cleanses very well without drying the hair out, but I&#x27;d recommend a conditioner to follow.</li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and looks much healthier without adding too much product.  </li>
            <li>this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>It was like a regular shampoo,no more ,no less</li>
            <li>What i remember so clearly, is that it is sulfate free, and barely suds up.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on my hair, help me to get rid of my split ends problem, my hair is super soft and shiny now, growing healthy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Color do not fade as fast with normal shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought the full line of this product and have only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>Btw, this is not my first purchasing; I considered this brand as my frequent hair treatment</li>
            <li>One thing you should consider when buying this shampoo is that it&#x27;s thinner than most which gives it less foam, a sort of drier foam.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who color their hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to work as hard when doing my own hair anymore.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair professionally colored and Macadamia really helps me keep retain the color longer.  </li>
            <li>have no negative reviews about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product as one to two times a week cleanser for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>A smaller bottle from a salon was much higher priced than this size.</li>
            <li>the product i received is nowhere near what i and my hairdresser use..</li>
            <li>,it made  my hair soo soft and shiny m</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended Macadamia natural oil rejuvenating shampoo.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is broken eventhough the packaging was ok</li>
            <li>dispenser was broken even though packaging was ok</li>
            <li>I bought this because two of macadamia&#x27;s products are my absolute holy grail but unfortunately this did not impress me, I found it to be no different from a cheap drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and has not stripped my dark color or the flame-red highlights I have currently.  </li>
            <li>Most smoothing, hydrating shampoos tend to weigh down my thick hair.</li>
            <li>It is super hard to wash this shampoo out of the hair, even after several rinsing.</li>
            <li>My hair also got much shiner and had some added volume (only slight, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This shampoo has calmed it down, but has not relaxed my natural waviness which is what I&#x27;ve wanted.  </li>

            <li> In fact I don&#x27;t use anything other than shampoos for my daily rinse, but this stuff....</li>
            <li> This shampoo has done wonders for my dry, brittle, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> Would advice it to everyone who has dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have a hard time with frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from dying it and is very dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy from coloring.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and a little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little ...</li>
            <li> because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, just buy the sample pack to try it first.  </li>
            <li> They left my hair dry and EXTREMELY hard and crunchy!  </li>
            <li> My hair was far less broken and ratty after a week of using (I wash my hair every-other-day, and I suggest you do this as well.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because it didn&#x27;t lather up as much as other shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> When water hits my hair it turns into a curly, nappy mess.  </li>
            <li> so I was anxious to try the products.  </li>
            <li> had one in at least 16 years.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and course.  </li>
            <li> Fake. Smells wrong.</li>
            <li> Lathers wrong.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me, it&#x27;s generally expensive but</li>
            <li> She is using all Macademia product, but finds that they are expensive.</li>
            <li> cuz i tried other products in the line and hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointment to buy this shampoo</li>
            <li> you will get ripped off. :(</li>

(shampoo/repair masque review)&lt;br /&gt;I have no negative reviews about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bucky Wilson&lt;br /&gt;www.facebook.com/bucky5676</li>
            <li> I loved the size of this because I feel I can go for months without having to buy shampoo again. It smells soo good! It feels like my hair is so clean after I use it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo because I watch a lot of gurus saying that this was so good and so on. I personally didn&#x27;t notice a big difference on my hair. My hair is damaged from dying it and is very dry too.&lt;br /&gt; It was like a regular shampoo,no more ,no less</li>
            <li> My coarse, color-treated hair has been looking for this shampoo all its life. It is very hydrating and has not stripped my dark color or the flame-red highlights I have currently.  My hair is not only coarse and color-treated, it cannot decide whether to be wavy or curly dependent upon where it resides on my head. This shampoo has calmed it down, but has not relaxed my natural waviness which is what I&#x27;ve wanted.  Most smoothing, hydrating shampoos tend to weigh down my thick hair. I don&#x27;t plan on switching shampoos anytime soon. Lastly, Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than any I&#x27;ve found in any drugstore chain.</li>
            <li> I just opened my big bottle of the shampoo...the product i received is nowhere near what i and my hairdresser use..it is runny and creamy and smells nothing like what ive been using...Im thinking bait n switch...that is my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have a hard time with frizz. I needed a shampoo that was more moisturizing and I love this line. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I&#x27;m used to, but there are good deals on Amazon and it&#x27;s totally worth it! It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing these products mentioned in youtube tutorials for curly hair so I was anxious to try the products.  I bought the shampoo, conditioning rinse and leave-in conditioner.  They left my hair dry and EXTREMELY hard and crunchy!  If that&#x27;s the texture your going for I guess it will work but it&#x27;s not for me.  It does however smell great.</li>
            <li> I have bought this shampoo many times at Pure Beauty and loved it. What i remember so clearly, is that it is sulfate free, and barely suds up. This was the most suddsy, drying, moisture stripping shampoo I have ever used, and I know that it is a fake. This seller should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo to pieces. I began to use my friend&#x27;s bottles over Christmas break, and I fell in love and ordered my own as soon as I could. The product is paraben and sulfate-free- which is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent ever, but it&#x27;s not gross- I could describe it as avacado-y? The prodcut works wonders. My hair was far less broken and ratty after a week of using (I wash my hair every-other-day, and I suggest you do this as well. This shampoo/conditioner may be too greasy for every day use). My hair also got much shiner and had some added volume (only slight, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good, healthy hair product but can&#x27;t afford Good On Ya- use this.</li>
            <li> dispenser was broken even though packaging was ok</li>
            <li> Good product, good seller.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this is paraben and sulfate free!  It does works well for color hair.  Color do not fade as fast with normal shampoo.  My color starts to fade around the 3rd wk or so....</li>
            <li> I have used macadamia products for 2 years. Have bought from salons, Amazon and the macadamia site. It&#x27;s not fake it is the real product. I love this product and I will continue in buying it.</li>
            <li> really great sulfate-free shampoo! Has kept my hair in good condition and smells great! I recommend you all trying it out.</li>
            <li> I love it this shampoo its very good and very rinse thank you so much im soo happy very much</li>
            <li> I love this product, The shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. And seller is a very nice person.</li>
            <li> I bought the full line of this product and have only used it twice.  Each time the results were spectacular!  Even my shampoo girl and hair stylist loved the way it made my hair smell, look and feel.  The shampoo girl just couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my hair and smelling the products as she applied them.  I don&#x27;t have a relaxer and haven&#x27;d had one in at least 16 years.  My hair is very thick and course.  When water hits my hair it turns into a curly, nappy mess.  Macadamia to the rescue....it makes my hair so much more manageable.  I don&#x27;t have to work as hard when doing my own hair anymore.  The end result is health, silky smooth manageable hair without all of the chemicals.  For the best results, I strongly recommend buying the shampoo, conditioning rinse (conditioner), repair mask, leave in conditioner, and oil.  If you&#x27;re skeptical, just buy the sample pack to try it first.  That&#x27;s what I did then after the first use, I purchased the 33 oz bottles of everything!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very good.  It contains no ammonia &amp; sulphate &amp; leaves your hair moist &amp; shinning.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that if you have highlights in your hair, it tends to lighten them.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has done wonders for my dry, brittle, damaged hair.  I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon and using it now for two years.  It&#x27;s made an amazing difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> One thing you should consider when buying this shampoo is that it&#x27;s thinner than most which gives it less foam, a sort of drier foam. It cleanses very well without drying the hair out, but I&#x27;d recommend a conditioner to follow. It smells wonderful and allows shorter drying time for my hair type which is needed as I have thick, color treated hair. I&#x27;d recommend this product as one to two times a week cleanser for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li> its really very good product it ,it made  my hair soo soft and shiny m i recommend it , please keep it at the market</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy from coloring. I have used almost every shampoo out there and still had the same problem. My stylist recommended Macadamia natural oil rejuvenating shampoo. I was a little concerned because it didn&#x27;t lather up as much as other shampoos I have tried. However, when I went to rinse my hair, every tangle came out and my hair never felt better. Everybody should try this, it&#x27;s the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> With extremely dry hair from years of bleaching I was not able to find just the right hair care until now.  My hair is moisturized and looks much healthier without adding too much product.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> Good product, took a awhile for it to get shipped though. If you need it fast , better look for it somewhere else..</li>
            <li> When my hairstylist used this product on my hair. i fell in love of how my hair felt and the scent of it. so the next day i had to purchase the Macadamia Shampoo and Conditioner and at that i bought a good size of it.</li>
            <li> My niece loves this, and reported that she has noticed a difference with the texture of her hair. She is using all Macademia product, but finds that they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time&amp; love it. The smell is very fragrant &amp; my hair feels great after I use it.</li>
            <li> A smaller bottle from a salon was much higher priced than this size. Like the product &amp; now can justify purchase by spending less for more! Works great for my hair which is turning gray &amp; I refuse to color! Makes it soft, shiny &amp; more manageable!</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product. I am not super impressed because it seems like just shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo ... I get my hair professionally colored and Macadamia really helps me keep retain the color longer.  You only have to use a little ... because a little goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product for those who color their hair.  The conditioner also works great.  Thanks for listening!</li>
            <li> this was the first sulphate free shampoo i tried when i first became natural. i actually like this shampoo, which says a lot cuz i tried other products in the line and hated it. a little goes a long way. it cleans my hair nicely without it feeling dry. i didnt buy mine from amazon though so i dont know much about the fake vs real thing. but i do like it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I have very long hair, and a little goes a long, long way.  The macadamia nourishes my hair, and I love it.  I am purchasing this again when I run out, which may be another 6 months.  With 33.8 ounces, it will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> I also use the moisturizing rinse, these leave my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shampoo I have ever used so far. It works wonders on my hair, help me to get rid of my split ends problem, my hair is super soft and shiny now, growing healthy and heavy. Don&#x27;t miss Macadamia products!! You will never regret. Deserve the 5 stars. Btw, this is not my first purchasing; I considered this brand as my frequent hair treatment but I think I became more greedy so I recently bought the giant size of every macadamia product that I could find lol... Qty of 2 of each item.. Don&#x27;t like to run out of them.</li>
            <li> this is not the real thing. it looks like it but it is not. it lathers and this product is not supposed to do that. just dont bye you will get ripped off. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointment to buy this shampoo</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, used it only once but already can see the improvement. Would advice it to everyone who has dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is super hard to wash this shampoo out of the hair, even after several rinsing.I love the Macadamia hair mask, but I would&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo for the whole family. We tried it once and have been buying every since.</li>
            <li> I bought this because two of macadamia&#x27;s products are my absolute holy grail but unfortunately this did not impress me, I found it to be no different from a cheap drugstore shampoo. I did however like the smell but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
