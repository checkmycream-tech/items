            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It does what is says and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>tamer is really nice but</li>

            <li>It holds them in place nicely.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to just sweep on your flyaways and lay them flat/away from face etc.</li>
            <li>Best John Frieda product by far!</li>
            <li>I have no idea why John Frieda took this product off the shelves in stores this by far the best product ever.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that stands up where I part on the side and always used hair spray etc.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and</li>
            <li>It is very precise.</li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job in keeping the hairs down and it does stay though its not 100% perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE John Frieda products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok, but the scent was just overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I need to get one or two more tubes:  one for my purse and one for home, as well as my work tube.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so well they could get more money out of ya</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I sincerely love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Ok, so basically this is like a mascara wand, but w/clear gel that you apply to your flyaways.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the John Frieda Flyaway Tamer.  </li>
            <li>Just brush it out and reapply :)</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s meant for touch ups rather than putting it all over your hair, it&#x27;s probably not the most convenient solution to my problem.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it would be better as a serum I could put on without the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how good this tames flyaway hair!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold like hairspray, but keeps the fly aways under decent control without making my hair so greasy.</li>
            <li>It is perfect and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>pretty good, non greasy, have to re-apply sometimes</li>
            <li>totally worth the price, and most of the Freida line is pretty great from my experience.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for flyaway hairs, it doesn&#x27;t leave the top of your head greasy like a lot of other serums for flyaways..</li>
            <li>Which is saying a lot because I LOVE free stuff.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it lightly, otherwise your hair will get greasy/crusty.</li>
            <li>My hair has been becoming curlier for some reason with lots of breakage (maybe an age thing).  </li>
            <li>I have stick-straight fine hair and this works great on the crown to tame fly aways.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a great product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to order this item,</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to order this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy application with mascara like wand.  </li>
            <li>This product works fine in a pinch, but it does get crusty, like hair spray goop crusty.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair in a bob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using clear masacara instead, which works so much better than I would have thought!  :-)</li>
            <li>This is a really awesome little product if you get a lot of flyaways, breakage, baby hairs</li>
            <li>It is perfect if you have damaged little fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Great for updos, short hair, and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from a rebate, otherwise it would have been over $6.  </li>
            <li>Really smooth&#x27;s away</li>
            <li>The brush makes it go on so smoothly</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether the hairs will stay smooth during humid weather, as we haven&#x27;t hit that season yet.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, I got it free (after rebate) at Rite Aid a while ago with some coupons.</li>
            <li>I just take the wand and brush ever so lightly and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works great and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes.</li>
            <li>You have to apply with a light touch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tames the fly-away hairs and makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>When it has run out I&#x27;ve tried spraying hairspray on the brush to smooth the hairs</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>You have to apply with a light touch.</li>
            <li>John Frieda have great products tried so much before they do soo much</li>
            <li>This product works great at catching the little flyaways!  </li>
            <li>I use this every day to quickly and easily get rid of flyaways in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tons of flyaways and baby hairs, and I&#x27;m so excited something like this exists.</li>
            <li>I have fly away grey hair that is away in my face.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this sold on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I have fairly frizzy, but fine curly hair and this product, in combination with the Sheer Mist, has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than a year, and was very disapointed when it was no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I went for it and was sooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>, I suspect some regular hair gel is going to be a more effective and economical solution for me.</li>
            <li>The idea is cool and it works but for $6?  </li>
            <li>I cant say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I have a ton of flyaways, mostly those hairs that are shorter than the rest of the majority of my hair that stick straight out.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re not staring at the hairs poking straight up off my head :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does have a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It tames the frizzies at the hairline and fly a way hair in other places</li>
            <li>It does wear off after a while, but it&#x27;s super portable.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>a quick comb through with just a touch of this product will take care of them without your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this product at the local pharmacy, but they stopped carrying it, so I was thrilled to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you wear your hair in a ponytail or a bun and have trouble with pesky baby hairs, etc., you simply smooth this wand over them and you are good to go all day, and it gives you a perfectly smooth look.</li>
            <li>Great product--tames flyaways without weighing down hair or looking like product-heavy.</li>
            <li>It really works and the packaging makes it easy to carry in your purse or pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>Takes care of the fly aways without leaving a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is an A+++ product and I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I always come back for more!</li>
            <li>This great products smoothes them right down and polishes up your do..</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>So worth it.  </li>
            <li>This product tames the wild hairs all day and looks great- not greasy or gross.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use - just use the wand to lightly brush some of the tamer onto your hair and instantly the flyaways are gone.</li>
            <li>Small size is great for travel or purse.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair, and although my hair is very healthy, the new growth at my part always ends up shooting to the sky in a not-so-polished way.</li>
            <li>fly away hair without a hard hair spray look.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to,</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does this.  </li>
            <li>This product is A+, does exactly what it says it does and keeps the job</li>
            <li>I love some of the other John Frieda anti-frizz products, so I was really excited to see this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note: Do some comparison shopping before you buy as this is most definitely not a twenty dollar item.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but damn why did they raise the price so much!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>THIS!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the second time that I bought this product, and once again I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to return but watch out!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you think it would do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find local anymore....</li>
            <li>I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li>This is a good product to tame flyaways.  </li>
            <li>It works great for getting those little fly-aways on the top of my head to lay down, and does not get crunchy like hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much that I am starting to stockpile it.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty much a mascara wand on steriods), but it doesn&#x27;t matter because when I use it those flyaways are kept under control.</li>
            <li>and it smooths them down nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have this product for the short pieces of hair that never seem to lie down.  </li>
            <li>It was gone in no time and you can get the same results spraying hairspray on a fine tooth comb and taming your frizzies like that.  </li>
            <li>, I actually wouldn&#x27;t even use it if it were given to me for free.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra-fine, ultra-thin, straight hair that never does anything I want it to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on the go, but as part of my getting ready in the morning routine.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to use than gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>You may need to reapply in really humid weather.</li>
            <li>The tube is shaped/sized much like a mascara tube</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>it works when my hair is curly or straight.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my fly-a-ways</li>
            <li>The brush allows too much product on it</li>
            <li>No one really talks about how after you have a baby that you start shedding all the hair you didn&#x27;t shed during the pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>So this stuff really works....</li>
            <li>An absolute must have on me at all times!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair granted, but I feel as if I have to use a lot of the product in order to get the desired look of no hairs sticking straight out.  </li>
            <li>However, at the VERY end of the day, it does get flaky.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of long fine straight hair and really struggle with frizzies from breakage.</li>
            <li>There are other products better than this.</li>
            <li>So much better than any other fly-away tamer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it (like they do so many other beauty products that I like)!</li>
            <li>It is weightless which is nice, and I like the smell, but once it dried, my flyaways came right back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i have never used john frieda because i always gravitate towards the high end products...</li>
            <li>I always have these little pieces of hair at the top of my head that want to wave around.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy and keeps the little hairs laying down.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and this one was just too much</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, especially if you can get it cheaper</li>
            <li>There definitely is not enough product in the small bottle, but I like it enough since I have not been able to find another product better than this so far.  </li>
            <li>Makes flyaways stay down easily</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, product is new and works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live without it now that I can talk to people</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>This products does what it says, it keeps my fine hair and shorter pieces down where they belong.  </li>
            <li>I love this product especially now that the weather keeps changing from one extreme to another.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be like hairspray on a small brush, but it works much better.</li>
            <li>This does what it says tames flyway&#x27;s without making hair look greasy like most products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>So after I run the applicator over my hair, I then have to smooth everything down with my fingers, which defeats the purpose of having the wand.</li>
            <li>there is not very much in the wand, and after a couple uses its already more than halfway empty.</li>
            <li>and it is not stiff or noticeable.</li>
            <li>You can keep this little wand in your purse as well, with much less worry, as it isn&#x27;t like hairspray/straight liquid that could spill super easily.</li>
            <li>I used to have to do the hairspray-on-a-finger trick to smooth things down, but this product eliminates that hassle!  </li>
            <li>was only half full (in the picture it shows the tube should be full), so I paid for only a half of tube of product....not cool.</li>
            <li>I am sure the flyaways are due to new hair growth as well as straightening (which I only do once per week and have actually tried to cut it out altogether to see if it helps any).  </li>
            <li>Hair spray makes my hair look dirty, and it doesn&#x27;t work that great for flyaways.  </li>
            <li>especially if you&#x27;re going straight.  </li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves hair smooth, not crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have problems with stray hair, short growing-out hairs and those pesky gray hairs that want to stand straight up Bride-of-Frankenstein style.  </li>
            <li>I am SO THANKFUL TO AMAZON for carrying this product at a reasonable price because I can no longer find it at local stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was like I expected, arrived at the right time and it works well.</li>
            <li>wand holds a small amount of the product, so its easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product, however, is easy to apply only to the rebellious little tufts of hair that don&#x27;t want to cooperate, styling them into submission without getting glop on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this to smooth down those pesky hairs that stick up all over my head, and especially the bangs.  </li>
            <li>I now am closer to having the smooth hair that I&#x27;ve envied on other women for so long.  </li>
            <li>price is $2 less than local drugstore &amp; with Prime shipping, the savings is well worth it!</li>
            <li>If you apply too much, however, it will dry crunchy until you brush it out.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely targeted towards a need of mine, as well -- I have waist-length, color-treated hair that I wear straight, but I do have a lot of flyaways, especially around the part in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be careful applying it-- make sure to wipe off excess product from the wand before applying, and don&#x27;t apply too heavily to roots.</li>
            <li>Only issue: too much and it will flake a bit the next day.</li>
            <li>Yes, if i put some on in the morning, the flyaways at the top of my head will stay down for about half the day.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and now can only find it for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that could just smooth down the few frizzy hairs near my part and bangs and this is it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a giant clear mascara brush, and you just apply it to the flyaway.  </li>
            <li>They are usually noticeable when I am trying to create the very sleek and straight look.  </li>
            <li>so I had to barely dab it on.</li>
            <li>Deep conditioner near my roots makes my hair too oily.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well to keep my flyaways down</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work all day, i have to touch up usually, but its so small and handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different gels and ways to calm those hairs down, but this product has been the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually helps.  </li>
            <li>I wish there were a cheaper solution (this little bottle doesn&#x27;t last long), but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the flyaway hairs a bay you can use it on wet or dry hair and</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just not coordinated enough, but every time I use this on my straight hair it just makes my part look slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li>One of the awesome women who was doing my hair had some of this in her arsenal to tame crazy hair and it&#x27;s the bomb!</li>
            <li>If I find I used too much I comb it out a little.</li>
            <li>I had some hair loss recently and as my hair is growing back, I have little sprouts at my part line that stick straight up.</li>
            <li>its also small and easy to carry around in your purse and pocket and it really does tame down the hair.....</li>

            <li> Very easy to use!</li>

            <li> Love this stuff...amazing!</li>

            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It does what is says and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> tamer is really nice but</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It holds them in place nicely.</li>
            <li> It is perfect if you want that smooth, clean, sleek look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to just sweep on your flyaways and lay them flat/away from face etc.</li>
            <li> Best John Frieda product by far!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why John Frieda took this product off the shelves in stores this by far the best product ever.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that stands up where I part on the side and always used hair spray etc.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and</li>
            <li> It is very precise.</li>
            <li> It does a fairly good job in keeping the hairs down and it does stay though its not 100% perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE John Frieda products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok, but the scent was just overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I need to get one or two more tubes:  one for my purse and one for home, as well as my work tube.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> so well they could get more money out of ya</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I sincerely love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> Ok, so basically this is like a mascara wand, but w/clear gel that you apply to your flyaways.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the John Frieda Flyaway Tamer.  </li>
            <li> Just brush it out and reapply :)</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s meant for touch ups rather than putting it all over your hair, it&#x27;s probably not the most convenient solution to my problem.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it would be better as a serum I could put on without the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how good this tames flyaway hair!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold like hairspray, but keeps the fly aways under decent control without making my hair so greasy.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> pretty good, non greasy, have to re-apply sometimes</li>
            <li> totally worth the price, and most of the Freida line is pretty great from my experience.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for flyaway hairs, it doesn&#x27;t leave the top of your head greasy like a lot of other serums for flyaways..</li>
            <li> Which is saying a lot because I LOVE free stuff.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it lightly, otherwise your hair will get greasy/crusty.</li>
            <li> My hair has been becoming curlier for some reason with lots of breakage (maybe an age thing).  </li>
            <li> I have stick-straight fine hair and this works great on the crown to tame fly aways.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to order this item,</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to order this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easy application with mascara like wand.  </li>
            <li> This product works fine in a pinch, but it does get crusty, like hair spray goop crusty.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair in a bob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using clear masacara instead, which works so much better than I would have thought!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome little product if you get a lot of flyaways, breakage, baby hairs</li>
            <li> It is perfect if you have damaged little fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Great for updos, short hair, and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from a rebate, otherwise it would have been over $6.  </li>
            <li> Really smooth&#x27;s away</li>
            <li> The brush makes it go on so smoothly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether the hairs will stay smooth during humid weather, as we haven&#x27;t hit that season yet.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, I got it free (after rebate) at Rite Aid a while ago with some coupons.</li>
            <li> I just take the wand and brush ever so lightly and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works great and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes.</li>
            <li> You have to apply with a light touch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tames the fly-away hairs and makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> When it has run out I&#x27;ve tried spraying hairspray on the brush to smooth the hairs</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> You have to apply with a light touch.</li>
            <li> John Frieda have great products tried so much before they do soo much</li>
            <li> This product works great at catching the little flyaways!  </li>
            <li> I use this every day to quickly and easily get rid of flyaways in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tons of flyaways and baby hairs, and I&#x27;m so excited something like this exists.</li>
            <li> I have fly away grey hair that is away in my face.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this sold on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have fairly frizzy, but fine curly hair and this product, in combination with the Sheer Mist, has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than a year, and was very disapointed when it was no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I went for it and was sooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> , I suspect some regular hair gel is going to be a more effective and economical solution for me.</li>
            <li> The idea is cool and it works but for $6?  </li>
            <li> I cant say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I have a ton of flyaways, mostly those hairs that are shorter than the rest of the majority of my hair that stick straight out.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not staring at the hairs poking straight up off my head :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does have a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizzies at the hairline and fly a way hair in other places</li>
            <li> It does wear off after a while, but it&#x27;s super portable.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> a quick comb through with just a touch of this product will take care of them without your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product at the local pharmacy, but they stopped carrying it, so I was thrilled to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you wear your hair in a ponytail or a bun and have trouble with pesky baby hairs, etc., you simply smooth this wand over them and you are good to go all day, and it gives you a perfectly smooth look.</li>
            <li> Great product--tames flyaways without weighing down hair or looking like product-heavy.</li>
            <li> It really works and the packaging makes it easy to carry in your purse or pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of the fly aways without leaving a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is an A+++ product and I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I always come back for more!</li>
            <li> This great products smoothes them right down and polishes up your do..</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> So worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product tames the wild hairs all day and looks great- not greasy or gross.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use - just use the wand to lightly brush some of the tamer onto your hair and instantly the flyaways are gone.</li>
            <li> Small size is great for travel or purse.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair, and although my hair is very healthy, the new growth at my part always ends up shooting to the sky in a not-so-polished way.</li>
            <li> fly away hair without a hard hair spray look.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to,</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does this.  </li>
            <li> This product is A+, does exactly what it says it does and keeps the job</li>
            <li> I love some of the other John Frieda anti-frizz products, so I was really excited to see this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note: Do some comparison shopping before you buy as this is most definitely not a twenty dollar item.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but damn why did they raise the price so much!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> THIS!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the second time that I bought this product, and once again I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to return but watch out!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you think it would do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find local anymore....</li>
            <li> I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to tame flyaways.  </li>
            <li> It works great for getting those little fly-aways on the top of my head to lay down, and does not get crunchy like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much that I am starting to stockpile it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty much a mascara wand on steriods), but it doesn&#x27;t matter because when I use it those flyaways are kept under control.</li>
            <li> and it smooths them down nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have this product for the short pieces of hair that never seem to lie down.  </li>
            <li> It was gone in no time and you can get the same results spraying hairspray on a fine tooth comb and taming your frizzies like that.  </li>
            <li> , I actually wouldn&#x27;t even use it if it were given to me for free.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra-fine, ultra-thin, straight hair that never does anything I want it to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on the go, but as part of my getting ready in the morning routine.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use than gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> You may need to reapply in really humid weather.</li>
            <li> The tube is shaped/sized much like a mascara tube</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> it works when my hair is curly or straight.</li>
            <li> It works really well on my fly-a-ways</li>
            <li> The brush allows too much product on it</li>
            <li> No one really talks about how after you have a baby that you start shedding all the hair you didn&#x27;t shed during the pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> So this stuff really works....</li>
            <li> An absolute must have on me at all times!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair granted, but I feel as if I have to use a lot of the product in order to get the desired look of no hairs sticking straight out.  </li>
            <li> However, at the VERY end of the day, it does get flaky.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long fine straight hair and really struggle with frizzies from breakage.</li>
            <li> There are other products better than this.</li>
            <li> So much better than any other fly-away tamer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it (like they do so many other beauty products that I like)!</li>
            <li> It is weightless which is nice, and I like the smell, but once it dried, my flyaways came right back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have never used john frieda because i always gravitate towards the high end products...</li>
            <li> I always have these little pieces of hair at the top of my head that want to wave around.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy and keeps the little hairs laying down.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this one was just too much</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, especially if you can get it cheaper</li>
            <li> There definitely is not enough product in the small bottle, but I like it enough since I have not been able to find another product better than this so far.  </li>
            <li> Makes flyaways stay down easily</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, product is new and works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live without it now that I can talk to people</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> This products does what it says, it keeps my fine hair and shorter pieces down where they belong.  </li>
            <li> I love this product especially now that the weather keeps changing from one extreme to another.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be like hairspray on a small brush, but it works much better.</li>
            <li> This does what it says tames flyway&#x27;s without making hair look greasy like most products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> So after I run the applicator over my hair, I then have to smooth everything down with my fingers, which defeats the purpose of having the wand.</li>
            <li> there is not very much in the wand, and after a couple uses its already more than halfway empty.</li>
            <li> and it is not stiff or noticeable.</li>
            <li> You can keep this little wand in your purse as well, with much less worry, as it isn&#x27;t like hairspray/straight liquid that could spill super easily.</li>
            <li> I used to have to do the hairspray-on-a-finger trick to smooth things down, but this product eliminates that hassle!  </li>
            <li> was only half full (in the picture it shows the tube should be full), so I paid for only a half of tube of product....not cool.</li>
            <li> I am sure the flyaways are due to new hair growth as well as straightening (which I only do once per week and have actually tried to cut it out altogether to see if it helps any).  </li>
            <li> Hair spray makes my hair look dirty, and it doesn&#x27;t work that great for flyaways.  </li>
            <li> especially if you&#x27;re going straight.  </li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves hair smooth, not crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have problems with stray hair, short growing-out hairs and those pesky gray hairs that want to stand straight up Bride-of-Frankenstein style.  </li>
            <li> I am SO THANKFUL TO AMAZON for carrying this product at a reasonable price because I can no longer find it at local stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was like I expected, arrived at the right time and it works well.</li>
            <li> wand holds a small amount of the product, so its easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product, however, is easy to apply only to the rebellious little tufts of hair that don&#x27;t want to cooperate, styling them into submission without getting glop on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this to smooth down those pesky hairs that stick up all over my head, and especially the bangs.  </li>
            <li> I now am closer to having the smooth hair that I&#x27;ve envied on other women for so long.  </li>
            <li> price is $2 less than local drugstore &amp; with Prime shipping, the savings is well worth it!</li>
            <li> If you apply too much, however, it will dry crunchy until you brush it out.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely targeted towards a need of mine, as well -- I have waist-length, color-treated hair that I wear straight, but I do have a lot of flyaways, especially around the part in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful applying it-- make sure to wipe off excess product from the wand before applying, and don&#x27;t apply too heavily to roots.</li>
            <li> Only issue: too much and it will flake a bit the next day.</li>
            <li> Yes, if i put some on in the morning, the flyaways at the top of my head will stay down for about half the day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and now can only find it for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that could just smooth down the few frizzy hairs near my part and bangs and this is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a giant clear mascara brush, and you just apply it to the flyaway.  </li>
            <li> They are usually noticeable when I am trying to create the very sleek and straight look.  </li>
            <li> so I had to barely dab it on.</li>
            <li> Deep conditioner near my roots makes my hair too oily.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well to keep my flyaways down</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work all day, i have to touch up usually, but its so small and handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different gels and ways to calm those hairs down, but this product has been the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually helps.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were a cheaper solution (this little bottle doesn&#x27;t last long), but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the flyaway hairs a bay you can use it on wet or dry hair and</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just not coordinated enough, but every time I use this on my straight hair it just makes my part look slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li> One of the awesome women who was doing my hair had some of this in her arsenal to tame crazy hair and it&#x27;s the bomb!</li>
            <li> If I find I used too much I comb it out a little.</li>
            <li> I had some hair loss recently and as my hair is growing back, I have little sprouts at my part line that stick straight up.</li>
            <li> its also small and easy to carry around in your purse and pocket and it really does tame down the hair.....</li>
            <li> In the absence of the applicator, I would actually consider giving this product an additional star (i.e., if it came in a squeeze tube or bottle).</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hair will get a bit stiff, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, it looks like a mascara wand that you use to apply a clear gel to your baby hairs or flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of little flyaways around my face, but most products that tame them weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you have those short stray broken little hairs that stick up out of the top of your head, use this product.  </li>
            <li> My sole complaint with this product is that there isn&#x27;t enough in the tube &amp; too much emerges on the comb at one time.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work well but doesn&#x27;t last for too long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that too much comes out which made me use it faster.</li>
            <li> Hairspray, putty, gel, none of them kept the hair laying flat for long.</li>
            <li> Ok, it does look dirty at the and of the day, and you have to wash it, but it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product works, but not for too long (like an hour or two).  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and gets caught in my mouth, my car door, gum, brush, barrettes…needless to say,</li>
            <li> But it turned out the new hair growth after that was way more annoying.</li>
            <li> It really helps tame down the flyaway hair.  </li>
            <li> a lit bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Now the hair is growing back and I have short little hairs that stick up.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up 5 days a week being in the military and with this I receive compliments on how my hair is never frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have been annoyed by my baby-fine fly-away hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> I got an empty tube out of the two tubes I bought.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky like hairspray does and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, even after multiple touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be careful when applying b/c it will get caught on other hairs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it leaked out during shipment, as the package it came in was crushed and the box was open.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a smell as other reviewers seem to have.</li>
            <li> so it is small enough to stash in your purse, cosmetic bag, etc.</li>
            <li> also it is small enough i can carry in all my bags</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually the gel that helps or just the wand</li>
            <li> I usually pull the wand out (resembles a mascara brush) then wipe it several times on the opening of the tube to get rid of excess product before I use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is also small enough to take it anywhere from a party to a grocery store.</li>
            <li> So until I found this miracle, I just had to live with the irritating baby hairs that stuck up off my head.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the touch-up flyaway tamer because it can make your hair look wet and/or crunchy when applied with a heavy hand.</li>
            <li> So, now I run through my usual routine with hair dryer, flat iron, and spray.  </li>
            <li> But it is not right for</li>
            <li> was afraid at first, because I thought that was gonna make my hair looks dirt or with the aspect when you apply Gel on it, but none of this happened!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the one I received</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tamed, but not plastered down.  </li>
            <li> They stay down all day.</li>
            <li> smoothes down all the flyways.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or look greasy.</li>
            <li> Even gotten other to use it!</li>
            <li> It does tame the flyaways, but can make hair flat and a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> I am black and doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> tames down those little hairs that stick up and around face.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a mess without this.</li>
            <li> but this is what I use to get those few stray hairs down along my part.</li>
            <li> Too much of it makes my hair a little stiff, too, so I do have to be careful not to go too crazy with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nearly impossible to find, but it&#x27;s seriously worth the hunt.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair down without looking stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have all this tufted little hair that sticks up all over the place at my hairline.</li>
            <li> I always have little flyaway hairs around my hairline and part and just a swipe of this</li>
            <li> Whenever I was done straightening my hair, I still had little baby hairs that would stand on end,</li>
            <li> It takes care of little flyaways in my part.</li>
            <li> I have crazy flyaways (curly/wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t know what it wants from life) and this thing does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair with flyaway on my hair line.</li>
            <li> I use it when I have a ponytail or bun and several of my broken hairs don&#x27;t want to find their way into the ponytail.</li>
            <li> I was getting really annoyed with the flyaways, especially in the front of my part.  </li>
            <li> My sister uses it to tame flyaways at her part when wearing her hair down, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> The wand doesn&#x27;t have a nasty/chemically smell and doesn&#x27;t get too gunky/or leave a stiff look to the hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver for those little whispy small hairs that you want to tame!</li>
            <li> I could never keep my fly-aways down until this!!</li>
            <li> This product takes very little &amp; holds those flyaways all day &amp; night.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small, so</li>
            <li> I suppose I could do a touch-up midway through the day, but that&#x27;s a hassle (although I note that the container is small and portable).</li>
            <li> I usually carry one in my purse &amp; have to touch up once or twice a day (depending on the humidity).</li>
            <li> I put just a small amount on the &amp;#34;mascara type&amp;#34; brush and brush my flyaway hair into place and viola</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and I ALWAYS have one tucked into my purse for touch-ups on the go.  </li>
            <li> and this absolutely makes those annoying little hairs stay in place.</li>
            <li> It is now hard to find, please John Frieda keep making this</li>
            <li> Those flyaways are hard to manage w/hairspray &amp; does not hold, +</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding it in stores lately</li>
            <li> Sucks that you can not find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve bought at least 20 of them since I found them by accident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone post-pregnancy that is struggling to keep those crazy re-growth hairs in check.</li>
            <li> I can use a very small amount and not have to worry about stray hairs or an oily appearance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid it would give a oily look to the hair, but you need so little to tame a hair here</li>
            <li> for my bad English, I&#x27;m not from USA)</li>
            <li> The only thing that works on my crazy thin hair!</li>
            <li> However, the tube is set up in a way that makes it difficult to get small amounts of the product out</li>
            <li> I get the same results by applying gel with my fingertips, disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, it becomes very hard and my hair ends up looking greasy.</li>
            <li> recommend for everybody who has those annoying little hairs growing and don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> but ill tend to use it...</li>
            <li> expensive but with it.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it is no longer sold (or very hard to find) in stores :(</li>
            <li> I have tons of fly-aways, and they drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> I have real bad small stray hairs around my crown and always wear my hair in a ponytail for sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive!!</li>
            <li> After pregnancy I had a ton of hair fall out, which was really annoying.  </li>
            <li> I have &amp; HATE fly-aways from years of heat styling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you use this product sparingly, it is great!  Otherwise, it does tend to get a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Awful&lt;br /&gt;Awful&lt;br /&gt;Awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blond, I dye my own hair and it loves to break off and grow out all crazy and wirey.  So until I found this miracle, I just had to live with the irritating baby hairs that stuck up off my head.  Especially in humid climates, they were out of control.  I tried everything, even the Mom, lick and smash to no avail.  I wear my hair up 5 days a week being in the military and with this I receive compliments on how my hair is never frizzy.  It is now hard to find, please John Frieda keep making this, it is life altering, don&#x27;t let my baby hairs take over again.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I carry it everywhere</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes flyaways stay down easily and it is not stiff or noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this product especially now that the weather keeps changing from one extreme to another.</li>
            <li> I LOVE John Frieda products, but not this one.  I got this product for free from a rebate, otherwise it would have been over $6.  $6!  The idea is cool and it works but for $6?  I wouldn&#x27;t pay $1 for this!  It was gone in no time and you can get the same results spraying hairspray on a fine tooth comb and taming your frizzies like that.  It also made my hair look extra oily by the end of the day. Will definitely NOT buy again, I actually wouldn&#x27;t even use it if it were given to me for free.  Which is saying a lot because I LOVE free stuff.</li>
            <li> Great! Arrived on time, product is new and works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid it would give a oily look to the hair, but you need so little to tame a hair here and there that it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> if you are a blonde, you suffer from some breakage and flyways.  This great products smoothes them right down and polishes up your do..especially if you&#x27;re going straight.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have ultra-fine, ultra-thin, straight hair that never does anything I want it to. I don&#x27;t think I have ever found a hair product that lived up to its promise. Until I found this. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, no muss no fuss. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have lots of little flyaways around my face, but most products that tame them weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  This product, however, is easy to apply only to the rebellious little tufts of hair that don&#x27;t want to cooperate, styling them into submission without getting glop on the rest of my hair.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does this.  If you apply too much, however, it will dry crunchy until you brush it out.  I don&#x27;t use it on the go, but as part of my getting ready in the morning routine.  It seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> This product is A+, does exactly what it says it does and keeps the job done well all day. Truly another excellent product from John Frieda!! Use it in the morning and take it with me but never seem to need it for a touch up even when it rains.</li>
            <li> This product works fine in a pinch, but it does get crusty, like hair spray goop crusty. There are other products better than this.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than gel. The gel in this tube is lighter so it doesn&#x27;t have the clumping effect that gel does. The wand makes it easier to use and control where you want to put it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok, but the scent was just overpowering.  I am sensitive to fragrances and this one was just too much and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The product works, but not for too long (like an hour or two).  Great for updos, short hair, and fine hair. Would recommend, although can leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The best item out there for fly-aways!</li>
            <li> perfect to avoid fly aways and baby hairs from sticking up.. a lit bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well to keep my flyaways down and it&#x27;s small, so I can carry it with me for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Works great.  I have used this product for more than a year, and was very disapointed when it was no longer available in stores. Works great for me</li>
            <li> I love some of the other John Frieda anti-frizz products, so I was really excited to see this product. It is definitely targeted towards a need of mine, as well -- I have waist-length, color-treated hair that I wear straight, but I do have a lot of flyaways, especially around the part in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me. Yes, if i put some on in the morning, the flyaways at the top of my head will stay down for about half the day. I suppose I could do a touch-up midway through the day, but that&#x27;s a hassle (although I note that the container is small and portable). I don&#x27;t want to constantly be leaving my office to take care of personal grooming matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator looks like a mascara wand. My problem with the applicator is that it actually LIFTS my non-flyaway hair up. So after I run the applicator over my hair, I then have to smooth everything down with my fingers, which defeats the purpose of having the wand. In the absence of the applicator, I would actually consider giving this product an additional star (i.e., if it came in a squeeze tube or bottle). However, the tube is set up in a way that makes it difficult to get small amounts of the product out *without* using the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not bad. My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy or oily at any point in the day after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I suspect some regular hair gel is going to be a more effective and economical solution for me. I&#x27;m not saying not to try this; if you have a different hair style/texture, you may find that it works. But it is not right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note: Do some comparison shopping before you buy as this is most definitely not a twenty dollar item.</li>
            <li> This has saved my hair life.  After pregnancy I had a ton of hair fall out, which was really annoying.  But it turned out the new hair growth after that was way more annoying. I have all this tufted little hair that sticks up all over the place at my hairline. Nothing I tried was keeping it under control.  Hairspray, putty, gel, none of them kept the hair laying flat for long. This stuff works great, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy and keeps the little hairs laying down. it doesn&#x27;t work all day, i have to touch up usually, but its so small and handy. I am going to buy like 10 and just keep them all over the place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product 3x already, and anticipate ordering it again in the future. I have long, straight, fine hair, and although my hair is very healthy, the new growth at my part always ends up shooting to the sky in a not-so-polished way. This touch up repair works wonders, and lasts about 6 hours. No gel or hairspray worked so well.</li>
            <li> This is just oil with a mascara wand, and doesn&#x27;t help my short flyaways.  I&#x27;m using clear masacara instead, which works so much better than I would have thought!  :-)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.  Takes care of the fly aways without leaving a greasy mess. You may need to reapply in really humid weather.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I made this purchase. After reading all the positive reviews I went for it and was sooooo glad I did. Great product!! Really smooth&#x27;s away fly away hair without a hard hair spray look. It&#x27;s very light and the mascara look wand holds a small amount of the product, so its easy to use. Definitely recommend to control the frizzes.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have tons of flyaways and baby hairs, and I&#x27;m so excited something like this exists. It does wear off after a while, but it&#x27;s super portable. Make sure you apply it lightly, otherwise your hair will get greasy/crusty. If I find I used too much I comb it out a little.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! You might think its just hair gel but it&#x27;s not. The brush makes it go on so smoothly and you cannot see that it&#x27;s there. This is by far my favorite hair product. I never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s The Best for my fine, frizzy hair.  My hair has been becoming curlier for some reason with lots of breakage (maybe an age thing).  So, now I run through my usual routine with hair dryer, flat iron, and spray.  When I get to work I use this to smooth down those pesky hairs that stick up all over my head, and especially the bangs.  I now am closer to having the smooth hair that I&#x27;ve envied on other women for so long.  I can&#x27;t say whether the hairs will stay smooth during humid weather, as we haven&#x27;t hit that season yet.  I&#x27;m thinking they will.  I need to get one or two more tubes:  one for my purse and one for home, as well as my work tube.  So worth it.  I hope this is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> This product works great at catching the little flyaways!  It&#x27;s like a giant clear mascara brush, and you just apply it to the flyaway.  Even my hairdresser was impressed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, I got it free (after rebate) at Rite Aid a while ago with some coupons. I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am I tried this product! It&#x27;s AWESOME I have fairly frizzy, but fine curly hair and this product, in combination with the Sheer Mist, has worked wonders for me. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough! I didn&#x27;t notice a smell as other reviewers seem to have.</li>
            <li> I have stick-straight fine hair and this works great on the crown to tame fly aways.  It&#x27;s basically gel in a tube - I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Best price I found. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I have just added this to my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t be without&amp;#34; arsenal. A great product indeed. My hair is a mess without this.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works at taming my flyaways - even hairspray doesn&#x27;t work. Bonus - this smells great!</li>
            <li> This is my only essential hair-care product. I have tons of fly-aways, and they drive me crazy. I wish there were a cheaper solution (this little bottle doesn&#x27;t last long), but it&#x27;s worth it. Just be careful applying it-- make sure to wipe off excess product from the wand before applying, and don&#x27;t apply too heavily to roots. I usually carry one in my purse &amp; have to touch up once or twice a day (depending on the humidity).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have no idea why John Frieda took this product off the shelves in stores this by far the best product ever.  I keep one in my purse and one in my bathroom.  I put just a small amount on the &amp;#34;mascara type&amp;#34; brush and brush my flyaway hair into place and viola it stays put.  I love love love it!  I cant say enough good things about it.  I am just so happy Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  If you have those short stray broken little hairs that stick up out of the top of your head, use this product.  It keeps the hair down without looking stiff.  When I wash it out my hair is smoother and stronger.  Use it -- I think you will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have fly away grey hair that is away in my face.  Everything  &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; product I have tried did not help the problem.  I have been looking for this product since I saw it advertised but could not find it.  I found it on Amazon ordered it .  I love it.  It works well .  I just take the wand and brush ever so lightly and the fly-away&#x27;s stay put all day.</li>
            <li> It works great for getting those little fly-aways on the top of my head to lay down, and does not get crunchy like hairspray. My only complaint is the one I received was only half full (in the picture it shows the tube should be full), so I paid for only a half of tube of product....not cool. Not sure if it leaked out during shipment, as the package it came in was crushed and the box was open.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff it is perfect for flyaway hairs, it doesn&#x27;t leave the top of your head greasy like a lot of other serums for flyaways.. Easy to apply and it lasts! Excellent!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! The tube is shaped/sized much like a mascara tube so it is small enough to stash in your purse, cosmetic bag, etc. It is easy to use - just use the wand to lightly brush some of the tamer onto your hair and instantly the flyaways are gone. I like to keep this in my purse to use when I am out and about and need to fix my hair. Works great for staticy hair too!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my fly aways.  I have curly hair.  When I straighten I have tons of fly aways.  This product is great for taming them.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have this product for the short pieces of hair that never seem to lie down.  Only issue: too much and it will flake a bit the next day.</li>
            <li> this was at Walmart last year for 6 something now they jacked the price up to 43!!! i still kept the tube cause i still use the brush end but damn why did they raise the price so much! i went to get some there and it was gone they must of figured it worked so well they could get more money out of ya</li>
            <li> This stuff is nearly impossible to find, but it&#x27;s seriously worth the hunt. Does its job and doesn&#x27;t appear to &#x27;wear off&#x27; through the day. Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that stands up where I part on the side and always used hair spray etc. to stop the fly aways, thank goodness for this creation it is genius! It really works.</li>
            <li> This is perfect and exactly what I was looking for! I had some stray baby bangs from breakage and with just a sweep of the wand they stay blended in with the rest of my hair all day. Love it. Does not leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I left this in the bathroom at work and now the office women are hooked on it. Sucks that you can not find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have real bad small stray hairs around my crown and always wear my hair in a ponytail for sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair with a lot of flyaways. I thought this product would be like hairspray on a small brush, but it works much better. It does tame the flyaways, but can make hair flat and a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time as have my grand-daughters and we can no longer find it in stores.  It tames the frizzies at the hairline and fly a way hair in other places</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve bought at least 20 of them since I found them by accident. I have been annoyed by my baby-fine fly-away hair my whole life. My hair tickles me in the face in a still room! This product has changed my life! It is invisible, flexible, perfect for my foolish response to flyaway hair. I love it. I wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> excellent! really good for frizzy hair! i recommend it! delivery estimated was perfect!</li>
            <li> wife enjoys but why have prices shot up and availability dropped to almost nil?</li>
            <li> This product came is great for anyone that has flyaways. It is the perfect product to keep in your purse. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have crazy flyaways (curly/wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t know what it wants from life) and this thing does the trick. It&#x27;s basically a mascara wand with hair gel inside the tube. It is very precise. I keep it in my purse and touch up my hair with it during the day if needed. Buy this if you have frizz/flyaways, it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and gets caught in my mouth, my car door, gum, brush, barrettes…needless to say, i have flyaway hair strands. This works like a charm. Perfection.</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver for those little whispy small hairs that you want to tame!</li>
            <li> I am black and doesn&#x27;t work for me. I use it on my virgin hair as well. I have course hair and it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> it works and i use it all the time. it works when my hair is curly or straight. also it is small enough i can carry in all my bags</li>
            <li> I sincerely love this product. It works really well on my fly-a-ways &amp; I even go a step further &amp; use it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> John Frieda have great products tried so much before they do soo much but this fly away tamer is really nice but the smell isn&#x27;t...but ill tend to use it...its also small and easy to carry around in your purse and pocket and it really does tame down the hair.....</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the best product ever made for fly aways!! I cannot live without it. Its a must have! I have no idea why it is no longer sold (or very hard to find) in stores :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It really helps tame down the flyaway hair.  Convenient size to put in your purse too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the second time that I bought this product, and once again I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid at first, because I thought that was gonna make my hair looks dirt or with the aspect when you apply Gel on it, but none of this happened! Ok, it does look dirty at the and of the day, and you have to wash it, but it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for everybody who has those annoying little hairs growing and don&#x27;t stay in place and you make a ponytail, I use for that all the time.&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry for my bad English, I&#x27;m not from USA)</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Doesn&#x27;t hold like hairspray, but keeps the fly aways under decent control without making my hair so greasy.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair with flyaway on my hair line. The brush allows too much product on it so I had to barely dab it on. Once it dries, it becomes very hard and my hair ends up looking greasy. I ended up throwing this away and using eyebrow gel with a tiny brush instead and it works great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way to spell it - but this is what I use to get those few stray hairs down along my part.</li>
            <li> No one really talks about how after you have a baby that you start shedding all the hair you didn&#x27;t shed during the pregnancy.  And with that shedding comes the re-growth of hair... Those tiny hairs that pop out in every direction on your head that you just can&#x27;t get control of.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different gels and ways to calm those hairs down, but this product has been the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually helps.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually the gel that helps or just the wand (it&#x27;s pretty much a mascara wand on steriods), but it doesn&#x27;t matter because when I use it those flyaways are kept under control. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone post-pregnancy that is struggling to keep those crazy re-growth hairs in check.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else like this flyaway tamer.  I always have these little pieces of hair at the top of my head that want to wave around.  Deep conditioner near my roots makes my hair too oily.  Hair spray makes my hair look dirty, and it doesn&#x27;t work that great for flyaways.  I am so happy that I found this product.  It is perfect if you want that smooth, clean, sleek look.</li>
            <li> Ok, so basically this is like a mascara wand, but w/clear gel that you apply to your flyaways. It&#x27;s very easy to just sweep on your flyaways and lay them flat/away from face etc. The wand doesn&#x27;t have a nasty/chemically smell and doesn&#x27;t get too gunky/or leave a stiff look to the hair. You can keep this little wand in your purse as well, with much less worry, as it isn&#x27;t like hairspray/straight liquid that could spill super easily. This is a really awesome little product if you get a lot of flyaways, breakage, baby hairs etc. totally worth the price, and most of the Freida line is pretty great from my experience.</li>
            <li> It works good but doesn&#x27;t work all day. When you put it on your hair, you must use sparingly because otherwise it looks like you&#x27;ve got greasy hair. I think it&#x27;s a combination of hairspray and gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!! If you wear your hair in a ponytail or a bun and have trouble with pesky baby hairs, etc., you simply smooth this wand over them and you are good to go all day, and it gives you a perfectly smooth look. My sister uses it to tame flyaways at her part when wearing her hair down, and she loves it too! John Frieda PLEASE PLEASE bring this back!!!</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the touch-up flyaway tamer because it can make your hair look wet and/or crunchy when applied with a heavy hand. I use it when I have a ponytail or bun and several of my broken hairs don&#x27;t want to find their way into the ponytail. It holds them in place nicely. I usually pull the wand out (resembles a mascara brush) then wipe it several times on the opening of the tube to get rid of excess product before I use it on my hair. I don&#x27;t have to rely on multiple bobby pins or barrettes to keep my fly-away&#x27;s in place during the day. I have had a hard time finding it in stores lately so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it (like they do so many other beauty products that I like)!</li>
            <li> So this stuff really works....however if you scratch your head you are going to have flakes. too bad</li>
            <li> I was getting really annoyed with the flyaways, especially in the front of my part.  I tried this stuff months ago and now I&#x27;m hooked! You just have to be careful when applying b/c it will get caught on other hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much that I am starting to stockpile it. I had a baby and after having great hair during pregnancy, my hair started to shed. Now the hair is growing back and I have short little hairs that stick up. I have fine hair in a bob. I put this in my hair and use as needed. I probably use this a couple times a day. It does not weigh my fine hair down. My only complaint is that too much comes out which made me use it faster.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on fly-aways! An absolute must have on me at all times!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!  Even gotten other to use it!</li>
            <li> I had some hair loss recently and as my hair is growing back, I have little sprouts at my part line that stick straight up. This stuff tames my sprouts and works until I wash it from my hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how good this tames flyaway hair! My daughter even swiped mine after I let her try it. The product isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves hair smooth, not crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product.  I was so excited to be able to order this item, cause you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anywhere.  The mascara-like wand applies a non-sticky, hair-taming serum to a several strands at a time.  I have problems with stray hair, short growing-out hairs and those pesky gray hairs that want to stand straight up Bride-of-Frankenstein style.  This does the trick.  It leaves my hair tamed, but not plastered down.  You have to apply with a light touch.  I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li> Great product--tames flyaways without weighing down hair or looking like product-heavy. Small size is great for travel or purse. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday. It really keeps the flyaway hairs a bay you can use it on wet or dry hair and it dosen&#x27;t make your hair look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. It is weightless which is nice, and I like the smell, but once it dried, my flyaways came right back. I would literally have to be applying this ALL day.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. The great thing. Those flyaways are hard to manage w/hairspray &amp; does not hold, + the hairspray flakes on2 one&#x27;s face. This product takes very little &amp; holds those flyaways all day &amp; night. Does not make hair oily or greasy, washes out. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I could never keep my fly-aways down until this!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and now can only find it for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she was looking for! Now it&#x27;s part of her regular cosmetic products all the time. And my daughter also is using them!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product. It was cheaper than what I would get it for in stores and works like a miracle. I actually bought two of these, one for me and one for my friend, and mine is almost out because I use it so often. So much better than any other fly-away tamer I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share).</li>
            <li> This product is the best. I&#x27;ve tried multiple tricks for taming flyaways (fabric softener sheets, hairspray sprayed on a tissue....) and this absolutely makes those annoying little hairs stay in place. If you use too much, your hair will get a bit stiff, so use sparingly. Definitely recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to tame flyaways.  I have a ton of flyaways, mostly those hairs that are shorter than the rest of the majority of my hair that stick straight out.  They are usually noticeable when I am trying to create the very sleek and straight look.  I am sure the flyaways are due to new hair growth as well as straightening (which I only do once per week and have actually tried to cut it out altogether to see if it helps any).  The last time I straightened my hair, I used this product on the part line as well as on any hairs that were sticking out along the entire hair shaft.  It does a fairly good job in keeping the hairs down and it does stay though its not 100% perfect.  I have a lot of hair granted, but I feel as if I have to use a lot of the product in order to get the desired look of no hairs sticking straight out.  There definitely is not enough product in the small bottle, but I like it enough since I have not been able to find another product better than this so far.  So overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works on my crazy thin hair! Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive!!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product at the local pharmacy, but they stopped carrying it, so I was thrilled to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.  It really works and the packaging makes it easy to carry in your purse or pack for travel.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This does what it says tames flyway&#x27;s without making hair look greasy like most products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s tames the fly-away hairs and makes your hair smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My sole complaint with this product is that there isn&#x27;t enough in the tube &amp; too much emerges on the comb at one time. Otherwise, I use this on my frizzy hair almost daily &amp; will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. It is perfect if you have damaged little fly-aways. It does what is says and smells amazing. It is also small enough to take it anywhere from a party to a grocery store. It gives you the perfect finishing touches for any style, cury or straight.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this stuff! This works perfect for flyaways or cowlick hairs!</li>
            <li> Every time I put my hair up I have fly always.  This products does what it says, it keeps my fine hair and shorter pieces down where they belong.  Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the John Frieda Flyaway Tamer.  Like other reviewers have said, it looks like a mascara wand that you use to apply a clear gel to your baby hairs or flyaways.  It smells fantastic and does a superb job of smoothing out my part.  It&#x27;s small and I ALWAYS have one tucked into my purse for touch-ups on the go.  I used to have to do the hairspray-on-a-finger trick to smooth things down, but this product eliminates that hassle!  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky like hairspray does and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, even after multiple touch-ups.  Totally worth the price, especially if you can get it cheaper online (or with an Ulta coupon, like I do).  This is an A+++ product and I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had the &amp;#34;Alfalfa&amp;#34; problem with my hair; cowlicks, flyaways, bits that go here and there, etc....  One of the awesome women who was doing my hair had some of this in her arsenal to tame crazy hair and it&#x27;s the bomb! I&#x27;ve ordered one for my travel make up kit, one for the car, one for home..... I just can&#x27;t live without it now that I can talk to people and they&#x27;re not staring at the hairs poking straight up off my head :)</li>
            <li> I use this every day now. It is perfect and lasts all day long. However, at the VERY end of the day, it does get flaky. Just brush it out and reapply :)</li>
            <li> I got an empty tube out of the two tubes I bought. Too much of a hassle to return but watch out!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works when you are in a punch and hair just won&#x27;t behave.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you think it would do. It tames flyaways. They stay down all day. This product works great! I&#x27;ll definitely buy more. Best John Frieda product by far!</li>
            <li> its a must have. smoothes down all the flyways. expensive but with it.</li>
            <li> pretty good, non greasy, have to re-apply sometimes</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long fine straight hair and really struggle with frizzies from breakage. This stuff seems to work well but doesn&#x27;t last for too long. Since it&#x27;s meant for touch ups rather than putting it all over your hair, it&#x27;s probably not the most convenient solution to my problem. Too much of it makes my hair a little stiff, too, so I do have to be careful not to go too crazy with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just not coordinated enough, but every time I use this on my straight hair it just makes my part look slightly greasy.  Yes, the flyaways are gone, but I would rather have those than a greasy part!</li>
            <li> I always have little flyaway hairs around my hairline and part and just a swipe of this and it smooths them down nicely. When it has run out I&#x27;ve tried spraying hairspray on the brush to smooth the hairs and it&#x27;s just not the same. The hair doesn&#x27;t stay as well. I always come back for more!</li>
            <li> Gives you a sleek perfectly finished look. Whenever I was done straightening my hair, I still had little baby hairs that would stand on end, a quick comb through with just a touch of this product will take care of them without your hair looking greasy. Salon brands retail for $20+&lt;br /&gt;So you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my holy grail beauty products. I was so excited to find this sold on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I use this every day to quickly and easily get rid of flyaways in my hair.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my purse since it&#x27;s the size of mascara.  It takes care of little flyaways in my part.</li>
            <li> Because I straighten my hair with a blow dryer every day, the front of my hair is tends to fly away. I can&#x27;t find anything to flatten it without it looking oily. This does teh job. I can use a very small amount and not have to worry about stray hairs or an oily appearance.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this product! I have &amp; HATE fly-aways from years of heat styling. This product tames the wild hairs all day and looks great- not greasy or gross. price is $2 less than local drugstore &amp; with Prime shipping, the savings is well worth it!</li>
            <li> It kept getting caught in my hair, it does work but I feel like it would be better as a serum I could put on without the brush.</li>
            <li> essentially just hair gel with a mascara wand.  I get the same results by applying gel with my fingertips, disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was like I expected, arrived at the right time and it works well. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hair product I carry in my purse to get rid of the day&#x27;s frizzies and flyaways.  I am SO THANKFUL TO AMAZON for carrying this product at a reasonable price because I can no longer find it at local stores.</li>
            <li> i have never used john frieda because i always gravitate towards the high end products... i was happy to see this worked as good or better than products that are way more money! love it!&lt;br /&gt;warning! there is not very much in the wand, and after a couple uses its already more than halfway empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that could just smooth down the few frizzy hairs near my part and bangs and this is it. I only have to apply once and they stay all day. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or look greasy. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find local anymore....tames down those little hairs that stick up and around face.  Easy application with mascara like wand.  Awesome price at amazon too!</li>
            <li> I have problems with stray hair, This does the trick. It leaves my hair tamed.  I was so excited to be able to order this item.&lt;br /&gt; You have to apply with a light touch. I have ordered several tubes and will be ordering many more in the future!</li>
            <li> Get this, get this, GET THIS!  It actually works!  It smoothes the frizzies and give your hair shine and smoothness...nowadays, nothing does what it says it does.....but this one?  YES!  Btw, no sticky oily residue after you apply it....just does its job...if you have fly away or frizzy hair, it has met its match with this...soooo impresed</li>
