            <li> this product is good on natural hair good for relax hair</li>
            <li> My second review on a product. This mask works really well. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. It is also a great detangler. I received it fast. I just received the deep conditioner. Haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I highly recommended the mask!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It makes my hair super soft. I use as a DC and add natural oils to it. It is a staple to my products! !</li>
            <li> I hate it, it&#x27;s seems expired to me, I felt my hair soooo dry, I don&#x27;t recommend this , it&#x27;s really wasting of ur money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair long,so I decided to buy this hair mask ! I used it once so far and just applied it to my roots and massaged it for about  5 minutes and left it over night !:) I love how it makes my hair so soft,NOT GREASY AT ALL!!! Smells like baby powder and not garlic . I plan to do this hair mask twice a week. I recommend this product ,I only apply to my roots cause on the bottom half of my hair I use other VATIKA hair mask for the ends!!:))</li>
            <li> This product makes hair very soft when detangaling especially when you are 4 months post relaxer and beyond.</li>
            <li> Made my hair stronger!!</li>
            <li> A must buy u won&#x27;t regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> used this 3 times - can&#x27;t really tell any improvement - but will use it up - has garlic - can&#x27;t hurt!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I love it. I have relaxed hair and I try to take care of it. Every since I decided to let my hair grow I see a little shedding here and there, so I decided to try this product and I like. I used it with a conditioning cap and set it on low for 30 minutes and the results is amazing. I will order this product again. My hair was extremely soft and manageable, I just love the results. My hair feels thick as well and a little brighter ( I have medium brown hair color). I think I&#x27;ll try the cactus next.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how this product felt on my hair.  I really like that it helped with the detangling of my hair.  It really felt moisturized post.  I used this in conjunction with a protein treatment to prevent the hard feeling the protein has on the hair after rinse out.  I did not feel any hard feeling in my hair with the use of this product.  I have 3c/4b coarse hair.  To be more specific, I mixed this product with aphrogee 2 step protein treatment and sat under a hooded dryer.  I could tell the protein was in my hair but not as hard and drying like when using the product as instructions state.  This mask kept my hair moisturized during the treatment.</li>
            <li> OMG the price is outragious here. You can buy these products for 5$ locally at an Indian store. 4 star for the product itself.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! I had a concern about the fragrance, don&#x27;t get me wrong it smells wonderful but its too over bearing, like a man who bathed in cologne. I am using it to combat shedding. My hair was so soft, manageable and smelled great. I use it as a deep conditioner with low heat. This was the first time so I am not sure if it has served its purpose, but I have notice less hair strands falling.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I recommended this product to my friend and we have different texture hair. It work for both of is. Amazing!!!! I&#x27;m so happy. My hair is growing. Btw I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good I love it but I don&#x27;t like the price that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m given 4 stars</li>
            <li> Makes the hair more manageable and has grown out longer and stronger. Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product last a month and I have mid thigh hair very sliky and shiny and stop hair fall quick less then week</li>
            <li> I loooove this product and now use it as my only conditioner!! It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and silky smooth I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! it has also made it healthier and thicker, I have a lot less split ends (but I also trim my hair regularly). I especially recommend this product to people with curly hair, because it makes your hair so silky that the frizz goes away and controls your curls more! LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love this product, very healing to my scalp.</li>
            <li> The product doesnt smell like garlic at all! I used it after I shampooed my hair and it felt a bit dry but it did help with shedding. Next time I will try it as a pre poo to see if its less drying</li>
            <li> I was recently introduced to how well Vatika products work for the hair. I could&#x27;t find any reviews on this item. It SMELLS great-not like garlic. It does provide good conditioning. I have used it once so far. I wash my hair weekly to every two weeks. I have African-American hair. I will continue to use to see how well it works on shedding. That is the primary reason why I purchased it.</li>
