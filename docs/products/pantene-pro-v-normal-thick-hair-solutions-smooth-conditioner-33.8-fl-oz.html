            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love all of Pantene hair product.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>

            <li>Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Without using it, my hair always have problem with static.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair gets smooth and static-free!</li>
            <li>This sounded awesome as I use big globs of conditioner every day.</li>
            <li>I feel like there are much more moisturizing conditioners out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner for many treats.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>33.80 oz bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but it is too light to last in my hair as a leave in.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner</li>
            <li>When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Shampoo and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum with Argan Oil, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li>This regime is working fabulously</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it any more highly. :)</li>
            <li>worth it!  </li>
            <li>Could never pull it off because of the super frizz Afro</li>
            <li>But just because I donate my hair doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t also want it to look great while I&#x27;m still using it. :)</li>
            <li>Less tangles is great for her.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and how soft it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo makes feel  silky but only for dry hair</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really large volume, can use a lot of time!</li>
            <li>if you happen to get a little suds in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, good value for a little better product, it has refreshing smell,too.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Thanks Pantene!</li>
            <li>This line is made for those who have an abundance of hair and are wanting to get it smooth, soft and under control.</li>
            <li>This line is made for those who have an abundance of hair and are wanting to get it smooth, soft and under control.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different conditioners from Garnier to Finesse, and everything in between even stuff from Biosilk.</li>
            <li>WE love using it and recommend it to anyone who has the same issues.</li>
            <li>This is of a higher quality, It&#x27;s good for thick hair, and It&#x27;s mild (chemically speaking)</li>
            <li>But thanks to the new Pantene Medium-Thick Hair solutions line, we finally have our own choices in hair</li>
            <li>exactly how large it was until it came.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m stuck with a huge bottle, I&#x27;m going to try using it in the winter when the humidity levels are very low to see if there&#x27;s any difference.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have the time to spend (or money) to sit in a saloon once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>So this product absolutely helps to the point where I must always have a bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li>I also condition my hair, but you really don&#x27;t need to with this product.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the quantity of the product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; conditions hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Needed to use way too much.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the old slickery style that really makes my hair soft, slinky and tangle free.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering in any way, and it makes hair so soft you can brush right through it while soaking</li>
            <li>Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li>I grow it out over several years and then have it all cut off and donate it to Locks-for-Love (an organization which makes human hair wigs for children with medical conditions who have lost their own hair).</li>
            <li>(and the shampoo from the same line) work wonders for making my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>many other people I dye my hair, curl it, flat iron it, style it, blow-dry it, and sometimes just like to put it up in a hair clip.</li>
            <li>Like many reviews say, it makes your hair appear thicker by making your hair puffy like a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to comb and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many hair care products out there for fine, thin, colored, frizzy, curly, damaged and every other kind of hair type, that those of us with very thick hair have just been stuck using one of those.</li>
            <li>hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the few conditioners that leave her hair looking clean</li>
            <li>I am mixed (biracial) and started to wear my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li>Much beauty/hair advice says not to use silicones because moisture has a harder time penetrating the strand, and it leaves a build-up.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a line for those with thin or fine hair</li>
            <li>then this product might not do much for you, but for those with medium thick hair that gets frizzy after you dry, I really recommend this.</li>

            <li> My daughter has super long thick hair</li>
            <li> But for the price (less than $10), this liter of conditioner is worth it for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It calms the straggler hairs yet still allows hair to be manageable for styling with curling irons without going flat.</li>
            <li> cause the argan oil can be too heavy for normal hair</li>
            <li> This bottle is over 2 lbs of conditioner, so even those of us with a lot of hair will find it takes a long while to use it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle is expected to last a long time though.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and can get darn right out of control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as long as a loaf of bread!</li>
            <li> your hair is long, thick, poofy, coarse, or any other variation of these, I highly recommend trying the Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions line.</li>
            <li> If your hair is long, thick, poofy, coarse, or any other variation of these, I highly recommend trying the Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions line.</li>
            <li> It works well with damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing else gives me the results I want every single time except this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, medium thick, black hair which is very prone to frizz</li>
            <li> I suppose you could mix and match any shampoo, but I typically just go with the same line of shampoo (to match the chemistry and everything).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2/4/13:  Not much of a difference using this conditioner in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Please check out one of the other lines for those hair types.</li>

            <li> I have always been in need of a shampoo and conditioner that was made for those with thick hair, and Pantene has finally created it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has incredibly thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you have hair that you would consider \\&quot;thin\\&quot; or \\&quot;fine\\&quot;, this will just weight it down.</li>

            <li> Now even those of us with long, thick boring hair can have a mane that looks phenomenal!</li>
            <li> this make their hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> phenomenal!hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People compliment my hair ALL the time and are constantly asking me my secret.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the newer &#x27;green&#x27; styles of Pantene products.  </li>
            <li> it became after a hour or so, but found a website that promotes using conditioner as a wash and also as a leave in product to tame and de-frizz hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner poofs out my hair, making it a frizzy mess!  </li>
            <li> have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still looks frizzy and dull, but not as poofy.  </li>
            <li> It adds volume, and makes my hair look dull and flyaway, like thick fuzz.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has thick and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair prone to frizziness in humidity.</li>
            <li> This Pantene is absolutely not as good as the one you buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair look worse.  </li>
            <li> Now even those of us with long, thick boring hair can have a mane that looks</li>
            <li> It looks horrible whether I blow it out or let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my hair won&#x27;t look so bad.</li>

But just because I donate my hair doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t also want it to look great while I&#x27;m still using it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other people I dye my hair, curl it, flat iron it, style it, blow-dry it, and sometimes just like to put it up in a hair clip. I have always been in need of a shampoo and conditioner that was made for those with thick hair, and Pantene has finally created it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner (and the shampoo from the same line) work wonders for making my hair super soft and manageable. It calms the straggler hairs yet still allows hair to be manageable for styling with curling irons without going flat. It gives hair just a touch of shine, but in no way makes it greasy. The scent is not overpowering in any way, and it makes hair so soft you can brush right through it while soaking wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 33.80 oz bottle is HUGE. I had no idea exactly how large it was until it came. This is not the bottle you find on the shelves of your local grocery store or Wal-Mart/Target. This is Sams Club/Costco size. It&#x27;s about as long as a loaf of bread! This bottle is over 2 lbs of conditioner, so even those of us with a lot of hair will find it takes a long while to use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * This is NOT a line for those with thin or fine hair * * *&lt;br /&gt;I always end up seeing posts/reviews from those who say they have thin/fine hair and shampoos/conditioners like this make their hair limp and lifeless. Yes, if you have hair that you would consider \\&quot;thin\\&quot; or \\&quot;fine\\&quot;, this will just weight it down. This line is made for those who have an abundance of hair and are wanting to get it smooth, soft and under control. Please check out one of the other lines for those hair types. This is not the one your looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is long, thick, poofy, coarse, or any other variation of these, I highly recommend trying the Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions line. It&#x27;s the best line of hair care I have found that offers products for these hair types. Now even those of us with long, thick boring hair can have a mane that looks phenomenal!hair limp and lifeless.

            <li> When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Shampoo and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum with Argan Oil, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners from Garnier to Finesse, and everything in between even stuff from Biosilk. Nothing else gives me the results I want every single time except this conditioner. I have long, medium thick, black hair which is very prone to frizz and I don&#x27;t really have the time to spend (or money) to sit in a saloon once or twice a month. So this product absolutely helps to the point where I must always have a bottle in the shower. I suppose you could mix and match any shampoo, but I typically just go with the same line of shampoo (to match the chemistry and everything). I still need to follow it with straightening iron, and get the semi-wavy/straight/messy look.    If you have very thick hair then this product might not do much for you, but for those with medium thick hair that gets frizzy after you dry, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and my two girls.  My daughter has super long thick hair and this is one of the few conditioners that leave her hair looking clean and she is able to comb through it.  Less tangles is great for her.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for frequent use. Eliminates frizz and also conditions in one step. I also condition my hair, but you really don&#x27;t need to with this product.</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair feel great I will always choose this brand in the future. Thanks pantene for a great product</li>
            <li> Hair shines, goodbye frizz on hot summer days!!&lt;br /&gt;Really works and a great bargain!!&lt;br /&gt; Grab it at this price, huge savings !!!</li>
            <li> This Pantene is absolutely not as good as the one you buy in the grocery store. My hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t had any conditioner in at all.</li>
            <li> best conditioner!  great deal for it!  won&#x27;t find better product even if you pay triple!  worth it!  the pump is key!  :)</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product and the best price online.  I am truly pleased with this product and will of course buy again!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair, not so effective on my beard, but then again I&#x27;m super manly so I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo makes feel  silky but only for dry hair cause the argan oil can be too heavy for normal hair</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for the quantity of the product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; conditions hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love all of Pantene hair product. This conditioner makes combing all of my three girls hair a life saver and I love the smell. A++</li>
            <li> Like many reviews say, it makes your hair appear thicker by making your hair puffy like a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to comb and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreoever, I think I am loosing more hair because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. It&#x27;s a good deal for the price and amount you get. Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Without using it, my hair always have problem with static. After using it, my hair gets smooth and static-free! And it&#x27;s really large volume, can use a lot of time!</li>
            <li> I got a good value on this and like how smooth my hair feels when i use it. Pantene works like it says in my experience.</li>
            <li> This is of a higher quality, It&#x27;s good for thick hair, and It&#x27;s mild (chemically speaking) if you happen to get a little suds in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, good value for a little better product, it has refreshing smell,too. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> good to use, i love it and recommend~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ !</li>
            <li> I tried this out as part of my &amp;#34;curly hair conditioner only&amp;#34; regime. I am mixed (biracial) and started to wear my hair naturally curly. Could never pull it off because of the super frizz Afro it became after a hour or so, but found a website that promotes using conditioner as a wash and also as a leave in product to tame and de-frizz hair. This regime is working fabulously so I am always looking for a good conditioner. This sounded awesome as I use big globs of conditioner every day. It smells great, but it is too light to last in my hair as a leave in. Needed to use way too much.</li>
            <li> Trusted brand. Great value. Pump is convenient. Conditions well. Would buy again. Bottle is expected to last a long time though.</li>
            <li> I feel like there are much more moisturizing conditioners out there.  But for the price (less than $10), this liter of conditioner is worth it for everyday use.  The pump is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I have this product on subscribe and save. If you&#x27;re wondering: it contains silicones, which coat your hair and make it shinier and silkier. Much beauty/hair advice says not to use silicones because moisture has a harder time penetrating the strand, and it leaves a build-up. Personally, I&#x27;ve never noticed a build-up and I&#x27;ve used this product for 7 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People compliment my hair ALL the time and are constantly asking me my secret. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it any more highly. :)</li>
            <li> when I was in my country, i was used to using pantene shampoo and conditioner. So after i came to boston, i still prefer to use the same product. Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has incredibly thick and coarse hair. This product makes her hair manageable. WE love using it and recommend it to anyone who has the same issues.</li>
            <li> It can not possibly be for normal-thick hair.  My hair was greasy just 8 hours after use.  I probably used this conditioner all of 3 times, the entire jug is under my sink.  It is a great price for the quantity you get, but also a great price for a horrid product.</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful conditioner, I love this product. It works well with damaged or dry hair. With a great price and two-day shipping well worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product and the shampoo as well about a month or two ago and I will be sticking with it too!  My hair is very thick and can get darn right out of control.  Ever since I started using this product my hair looks healthier and feels stronger. I would recommend this to anyone that has thick and frizzy hair.  You&#x27;ll see a difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> The title says it.. I will not purchase anymore. I thought its a good deal and I save but its not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the newer &#x27;green&#x27; styles of Pantene products.  They simply don&#x27;t work.  This conditioner is the old slickery style that really makes my hair soft, slinky and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - love it!!</li>
            <li> Works so well with my hair and smells amazing! Love that it has the salon style pump! Arrived fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I buy this for our entire family of 5, it works great for everyone in the family and it smells great for guys and gals!</li>
            <li> This conditioner poofs out my hair, making it a frizzy mess!  I have thick wavy hair prone to frizziness in humidity. This stuff makes my hair look worse.  It adds volume, and makes my hair look dull and flyaway, like thick fuzz.  It looks horrible whether I blow it out or let it air dry.  I just got this conditioner recenty so I&#x27;ve only been using it during the summer.  I&#x27;m not using it anymore for now.  I can&#x27;t stand how my hair looks when I use it.  Since I&#x27;m stuck with a huge bottle, I&#x27;m going to try using it in the winter when the humidity levels are very low to see if there&#x27;s any difference.  Hopefully my hair won&#x27;t look so bad. I will never again buy another Pantene product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/4/13:  Not much of a difference using this conditioner in the winter.  My hair still looks frizzy and dull, but not as poofy.  I prefer Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine. Will never buy Pantene again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner for many treats. Tried other expensive products too but haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference between them. I&#x27;m sticking to Pantene.</li>
            <li> I also bought the shampoo and I love it. I love the smell of it and how soft it leaves my hair. I also like the fact that I got a big bottle so it will last me a while.</li>
