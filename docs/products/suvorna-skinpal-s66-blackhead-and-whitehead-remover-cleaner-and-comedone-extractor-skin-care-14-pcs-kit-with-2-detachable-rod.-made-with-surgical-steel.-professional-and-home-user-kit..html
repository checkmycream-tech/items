            <li>(YouTube is a great source.)</li>
            <li>This kit is amazing!</li>
            <li>the tool works wonderfully, and I love the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m no dermatologist so good luck.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time in good condition.</li>
            <li>Over all very pleased with these for the price.</li>
            <li>So many to choose from!</li>
            <li>A fancy case, for something not so elegant!</li>
            <li>Much better than squeezing zits!</li>
            <li>This item worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled that I bought this.</li>
            <li>nice set, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li>Instructions would be nice too.</li>
            <li>Good quality, changing heads is easy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy one day.    </li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad product or a start to good skin.</li>
            <li>Very cheap steel.</li>
            <li>nice kit, build quality was solid, very good</li>
            <li>ends one wire end, while sturdy not my favorite piece</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Over all ok.</li>
            <li>Beside that, the variety of the tips is really interesting as there is a sizer for every bump on your face.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>This will break it in better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t inspected all the pieces included in the set, but I was able to fix the problems I did find with some diamond files I have in my tool box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These implements would attach much better to the shafts if they were of a hexagonal design, and attached with magnets, as featured on many miniature screwdriver tools.</li>
            <li>These instruments are outstanding for removing blackheads and whiteheads from the face, nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that it came with 2 handles that can carry two attachments at a time.  </li>
            <li>The are wonderful, sturdy personal grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>It has many inter-changeable heads for the job you need to do.  </li>
            <li>Most of the tools you wouldn&#x27;t even bother with.  </li>
            <li>I thought the quality would be better, but maybe I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using most of the heads, but I&#x27;m not an aesthetician.</li>
            <li>The case is elegant, the tools come with an instruction booklet, and the wands are easy to change and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very Nice Professional Kit, with everything you need to keep skin Healthy, Clean, and well Cared for!</li>
            <li>The case keeps everything organized and clean!</li>
            <li>I have the feeling that if you bought all the kits or half of them (most popular ones) you could make a really good set up on your own.</li>
            <li>They are easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>make sure you clean with rubbing alcohol before and after each use.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Everything is almost perfect, until you realize that it time to tighten the tip against the holder, again, even though you just did it a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li>Some pieces don&#x27;t screw in smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have used this only one time and it did a great job for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Great buy, works better than i had expected!</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t fix everything you also need to drink lots of water to keep the pores clean.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets on spending the money to buy such an awesome piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>I have other pimple removers and this is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li>First and foremost you don&#x27;t need this many parts, I use at most 4 of the different heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, everything is kind of a pain to get out of the box; there&#x27;s not really enough room to put your finger for prying anything out.</li>
            <li>If they cost $10 I wouldn&#x27;t fault them for their problems, but for $45 they should be made far better.</li>
            <li>The lancets are perfect calibrated and enough heavy to pierce the skin when needed.</li>
            <li>Handles and instruments are fitting securely into each other with the exception of one of them.</li>
            <li>The product is very sturdy the case is ok altough some of the smaller attachments could slide out of the rubberband but rarely still.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they would provide 2 handles instead of one in the package, with that many attachments you could use 2 tools at once.    </li>
            <li>Love these tools, takes sometime to figure out how to properly use them.</li>
            <li>I am an avid pimple popper.</li>
            <li>Although I will be honest and say that the screw in pieces are not very sturdy but it still usable.</li>
            <li>First -  its a quality kit.</li>
            <li>May need to play with them first.</li>
            <li>I will write back if I have any more news.</li>
            <li>When I got this at home at first I was scared of using them.</li>
            <li>Get a smaller kit, mostly with the wire loops, as that&#x27;s all you really need.  </li>
            <li>The large array of comedone extractors lets you a choice for almost any problems that you can have.</li>
            <li>first opening the kit and attempting to attach one of the implements to the shaft -- I went for the \\&quot;thin rolled loop,\\&quot; which is probably a tool most people will use more than others -- I felt something pierce my finger; a splinter of metal from the thread-cutting process protruded from the shaft, and had cut my finger.</li>
            <li>All the others I didn&#x27;t really care about</li>
            <li>My husband loves this, it really does work.</li>
            <li>Not too much, unless you are a doctor I guess.</li>
            <li>Pieces are recessed into the case too much, where you need to dig them out.</li>
            <li>but know I&#x27;m ready to take on any blemishes that come my way.  </li>
            <li>This skin blemish tool is very well designed, with every combination end you could want.  </li>
            <li>Way overkill in terms of what you really need for extractions.  </li>
            <li>They  really work very well.</li>
            <li>Always use this product after loosening up your pores, steam would be best but at least wash w/ warm/hot water with hot towel for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>attached: the implements tend to loose themselves from the shaft pretty quickly, which requires stopping and re-tightening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice variety of tools, but the quality-control is really lacking, and there are some serious design aspects which have been overlooked for this to be a really \\&quot;professional\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice variety of tools, but the quality-control is really lacking, and there are some serious design aspects which have been overlooked for this to be a really \\&quot;professional\\&quot; set.    </li>
            <li>I have some big blackheads and most of these are still too big.</li>
            <li>The handles have a knurled surface so you get a steady grip while removing the unwanted blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just love my little case with tools.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had just had a tetanus shot, and the set comes with two shafts, so I switched to the other one.</li>
            <li>so i ended up having a few owwies from the experience, but it is a great tool once you figure it out via watching a few videos. ^_^</li>
            <li>You will have to make sure the tips are twisted in good and tight during use.</li>
            <li>surprised no small lance included.</li>
            <li>Can help you clear up and save money.</li>
            <li>Gently screw the pieces in and gently back out.</li>
            <li>I am surprised.</li>
            <li>Professional quality instruments.</li>
            <li>This kit has a nice variety of tools from which to choose, but the implements are poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try out the product, but when I screwed it on, it felt flimsy and with every press on my face to remove the black head, the top became loose.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>For something which is going to be used for what basically amounts to minor medical procedures: the quality of finish on these tools needs to be much higher for them not to be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I removed the implement to inspect it further, and noticed that the very end of the screw thread was hanging-off the implement; if I had not noticed this jagged little bit I may have cut myself again, and these were just the first two things I removed from the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the smallest hole for a whitehead is too large for the ones I get near my lip line (which are microscopic and close to each other).</li>
            <li>I proceeded to screw the \\&quot;thin rolled loop\\&quot; into the shaft, but it didn&#x27;t fit securely, and wobbled a little bit.</li>
            <li>When compared to the prices for all the various pieces out there, this isn&#x27;t a bad deal but probably a little more than I would have liked to have paid.  </li>
            <li>they are BOTH very pointy sharp (which is what you want, but doesn&#x27;t seem like it in the photo)  </li>

            <li> I got this tool for the blackhead thingies... It came with a lot of extras that I have no idea how to use. NO instruction sheet. I went to the product website (Suvorna), and everything said to consult the instruction manual. Wish I would have gotten one.&lt;br /&gt;But the tool works wonderfully, and I love the case.&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;I emailed customer service (cs@suvorna.com) and it didn&#x27;t even take them 2 hours to email me the instruction booklet! Awesome customer service!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a review so I thought I&#x27;d put my 2 cents in.  I&#x27;m no expert by any means but I knew what I was looking for, the really small angled bowl end and the large mesh(?) bowl.  All the others I didn&#x27;t really care about but this was the only one with the attachments I felt I needed.  The lancets in the image is a bit deceptive they are BOTH very pointy sharp (which is what you want, but doesn&#x27;t seem like it in the photo)  The first one is a triangular tip and the other is actually hooked to a point although in the image it looks like a dull rounded end.    I have a tweezerman with the two big loop ends one wire end, while sturdy not my favorite piece and this one comes with both.  So I wish I spent the money on this set to begin with but I thought going cheapest product would have sufficed.  Personally I don&#x27;t even know how some of the attachments are geared for but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy one day.    The product is very sturdy the case is ok altough some of the smaller attachments could slide out of the rubberband but rarely still.  I only wish they would provide 2 handles instead of one in the package, with that many attachments you could use 2 tools at once.    When compared to the prices for all the various pieces out there, this isn&#x27;t a bad deal but probably a little more than I would have liked to have paid.  Wish it had the pieces I wanted and not some of the others for less price. All in all I am happy with my purchase.    P.S. Always use this product after loosening up your pores, steam would be best but at least wash w/ warm/hot water with hot towel for a few minutes.  Also I&#x27;ve heard many things to do afterwards, ie, use acne medication or astringent also after cleaning use cold towel or water to close the pores.  I use an astringent and I think that closes up the pores but I&#x27;m no dermatologist so good luck.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, it really does work. The only downside is we usually end up using the same 2-3 tools.</li>
            <li> Only way to do away with a blackhead.&lt;br /&gt;very nice kit, build quality was solid, very good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it maybe.</li>
            <li> Good quality, changing heads is easy. However, the smallest hole for a whitehead is too large for the ones I get near my lip line (which are microscopic and close to each other). Used my nails for that. But the set is a keeper, you never know when the big one&#x27;s gonna hit your face!</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing! Has everything you could possibly need! The case keeps everything organized and clean! I have other pimple removers and this is by far the best quality. Some removers leave marks when you use them this kit does not!</li>
            <li> Love these tools, takes sometime to figure out how to properly use them. They can&#x27;t fix everything you also need to drink lots of water to keep the pores clean.</li>
            <li> I have some big blackheads and most of these are still too big. I do use it a lot, but I usually only use the two basic ones.., which had I known this I would have just stuck with the one you can get at cvs for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> So many to choose from! I love this product. I am an avid pimple popper. Gross I know but hey it happens. This thing helps get those hard to pop pimples in no time at all. Also I am a decedent of the hairy middle eastern people so I have a lot of in grown hairs. This product helps me to scrap off the skin and expose the hair! I am absolutely thrilled that I bought this. I have no regrets on spending the money to buy such an awesome piece of equipment. Although I will be honest and say that the screw in pieces are not very sturdy but it still usable.</li>
            <li> First -  its a quality kit. Lances are only medium and large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very surprised no small lance included. Like needle size....or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over all ok. I will never use all of these though.</li>
            <li> Finally found th same set my father owned. Works great.</li>
            <li> Everything is almost perfect, until you realize that it time to tighten the tip against the holder, again, even though you just did it a few minutes ago. Beside that, the variety of the tips is really interesting as there is a sizer for every bump on your face.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li> Worse ever. Get the tweezerman system. This one does nothing but cut your face.</li>
            <li> What is out there. Not too much, unless you are a doctor I guess. Products made in 3rd world countries often have issues. This product is ok. One of the pieces, or the common oval shaped loop can&#x27;t always take the pressure needed. It starts to bend. All in all, not a bad product or a start to good skin. The price should be maybe $20 or $25 max!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues with the threads on the holders and pieces. May need to play with them first. Gently screw the pieces in and gently back out. This will break it in better. Some pieces don&#x27;t screw in smoothly. Casting or molding issues? Pieces are recessed into the case too much, where you need to dig them out. A fancy case, for something not so elegant! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have been the best choice out there. I have the feeling that if you bought all the kits or half of them (most popular ones) you could make a really good set up on your own. Find a deal on one. Wipe Everything down with some rubbing alcohol before and after use. Can help you clear up and save money.</li>
            <li> This kit has a nice variety of tools from which to choose, but the implements are poorly manufactured. For something which is going to be used for what basically amounts to minor medical procedures: the quality of finish on these tools needs to be much higher for them not to be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first opening the kit and attempting to attach one of the implements to the shaft -- I went for the \\&quot;thin rolled loop,\\&quot; which is probably a tool most people will use more than others -- I felt something pierce my finger; a splinter of metal from the thread-cutting process protruded from the shaft, and had cut my finger. Fortunately, I had just had a tetanus shot, and the set comes with two shafts, so I switched to the other one. I proceeded to screw the \\&quot;thin rolled loop\\&quot; into the shaft, but it didn&#x27;t fit securely, and wobbled a little bit. I removed the implement to inspect it further, and noticed that the very end of the screw thread was hanging-off the implement; if I had not noticed this jagged little bit I may have cut myself again, and these were just the first two things I removed from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t inspected all the pieces included in the set, but I was able to fix the problems I did find with some diamond files I have in my tool box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When attached: the implements tend to loose themselves from the shaft pretty quickly, which requires stopping and re-tightening. If I don&#x27;t send these back for a refund: I might try some thread tape to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These implements would attach much better to the shafts if they were of a hexagonal design, and attached with magnets, as featured on many miniature screwdriver tools. A hexagonal design would prevent the implements from spinning in the shaft, and would eliminate the need to cut threads into anything, which would also eliminate the possibility of metal shards being jammed into the fingers of unsuspecting \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; who might use this product on themselves or their clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, everything is kind of a pain to get out of the box; there&#x27;s not really enough room to put your finger for prying anything out. I guess the box does keep everything in-place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice variety of tools, but the quality-control is really lacking, and there are some serious design aspects which have been overlooked for this to be a really \\&quot;professional\\&quot; set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken some close-up photos which show the manufacturing defects in these items, but for some reason I am not allowed to add customer photos to this product page, which makes me a little suspicious.ind of a pain to get out of the box; there&#x27;s not really enough room to put your finger for prying anything out.

            <li> These instruments are outstanding for removing blackheads and whiteheads from the face, nose and forehead.  I was pleased to see that it came with 2 handles that can carry two attachments at a time.  The handles have a knurled surface so you get a steady grip while removing the unwanted blemishes.  I wish I would have known about this tool long ago but know I&#x27;m ready to take on any blemishes that come my way.  They heal faster by using this instrument instead of using your fingernails.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item worked amazingly well. I&#x27;m just a newbie so i ended up having a few owwies from the experience, but it is a great tool once you figure it out via watching a few videos. ^_^</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in good condition. Would purchase from again. Handles and instruments are fitting securely into each other with the exception of one of them. This is out of the box. I have used this only one time and it did a great job for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The are wonderful, sturdy personal grooming tools.  It has many inter-changeable heads for the job you need to do.  They are easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> This skin blemish tool is very well designed, with every combination end you could want.  And with two shafts, you can set one tool up for the typical whitehead, and one for the typical blackhead.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my skin are class, and am I ever happy with it. Well thought out, with the tool for every need.</li>
            <li> I just love my little case with tools. The lancets are perfect calibrated and enough heavy to pierce the skin when needed. The large array of comedone extractors lets you a choice for almost any problems that you can have. The case is elegant, the tools come with an instruction booklet, and the wands are easy to change and sturdy. I am just happy up to now. I will write back if I have any more news.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The quality of these seems to be really great and for the price and the number of head varieties are awesome! Read some reviews on people having issues with it not working. I am surprised. You have to use these when your skin has been warmed or else black heads are really hard to remove. So I use it after a hot shower usually!</li>
            <li> I had all the same issues found in Sean A.M.&#x27;s review, and don&#x27;t feel the need to repeat them. If they cost $10 I wouldn&#x27;t fault them for their problems, but for $45 they should be made far better.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Professional Kit, with everything you need to keep skin Healthy, Clean, and well Cared for!</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my black heads, white heads, and acne (in between facial treatments). When I got this at home at first I was scared of using them. So I read what each one actually does carefully. One day I had a acne and I wanted to try out the product, but when I screwed it on, it felt flimsy and with every press on my face to remove the black head, the top became loose. That&#x27;s when I made up my mind and decided to return this product. I&#x27;m going to stick to my tweezerman.</li>
            <li> First and foremost you don&#x27;t need this many parts, I use at most 4 of the different heads. For the price you think that the parts would stay on the handles, unfortunately you have to tighten the heads onto the handle multiple times while using as they generally fell loose almost immediately and begin to wiggle and wobble. The heads themselves are well designed, but their use with the handle is deplorable. I suggest tools that don&#x27;t screw onto a handle after using this set, you will have less fuss out of them. Also, having the heads separate from the handles makes the individual parts easier to lose and I have already lost one to the drain.</li>
            <li> Broken tool, right in the box. Way overkill in terms of what you really need for extractions.  Most of the tools you wouldn&#x27;t even bother with.  Get a smaller kit, mostly with the wire loops, as that&#x27;s all you really need.  Bought the smaller kit and returned that as well after one of the tools broke. Very cheap steel.</li>
            <li> nice set, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> I thought the quality would be better, but maybe I guess you get what you pay for. I only use 2 tools so it was a waste of money for me. I can&#x27;t imagine using most of the heads, but I&#x27;m not an aesthetician. Instructions would be nice too.</li>
            <li> Professional quality instruments. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses comedone extractors.  They  really work very well.</li>
            <li> Great buy, works better than i had expected!</li>
            <li> The tool set is well made and works as expected.  I find it unlikely that I will use all of the tools, so one may be better off ordering a smaller set or specific tools.</li>
            <li> Much better than squeezing zits! Take the time to educate yourself on how to use these tools! (YouTube is a great source.) make sure you clean with rubbing alcohol before and after each use.  You will have to make sure the tips are twisted in good and tight during use. Over all very pleased with these for the price.</li>
            <li> Low price!  Good quality!  Quick delivery!</li>
