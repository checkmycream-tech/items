            <li>Pleasant smell and great coverage.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the makeup!  </li>
            <li>But it does a good job covering blemishes/imperfections, and serves as hiliter as well.</li>
            <li>Good concealer.  </li>
            <li>Glo Minerals did not do that which was good.  </li>
            <li>The golden color was perfect for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Such a beautiful feel makes the perfect concealer and amazing highlighter</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a really good concealer and was pleased to find that the glo Minerals line has one.  </li>
            <li>So it works nicely for me.</li>
            <li>I liked that it hid any imperfections.  </li>
            <li>it is a great product and does exactly what is says!</li>
            <li>With that being said, its lasts ok throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I love it to death and it will always have a place in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I use it when my skin is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, well-thought-out product that I would say is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the minerals are supposed to be good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was just about to give up on finding a full overage corrective concealer until I found this!</li>
            <li>It made my skin look smooth and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>We all need a little \\&quot;extra\\&quot; help now and then and knowing that the ingredients are the best made my decision pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I consulted some other sites and did come up with the fact that Golden seems to work for very fair people.  </li>
            <li>sensitive, fair skin and this concealer does a great job of concealing breakouts (without making them worse).</li>
            <li>Glo Minerals to me was really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product provides just the right coverage, right where I need and want it</li>
            <li>Perfectly fine and good with my complexion which is a mix of yellow and red tones.</li>
            <li>I am a fair complected, (medium-toned) natural blonde, but change my hair color often (platinum, black, red and every shade in between), and Golden works great with all of my looks!</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and turns matte immediately, but being fair skinned, the color was far too dark.  </li>
            <li>I do like it, only wish it were a more light-weight consistency for even easier application.</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e been using this product for about 5 years and it never fails.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried it might look gold, it kind of appears that way slightly, but when I put it on it absolutely matched my fair skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Women that worry about pulling the skin around their eye area, might not care for it so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin (almost translucent) and really really bad dark circles.</li>
            <li>All in all I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with dark circles.</li>

            <li> Yes, I agree deciding on a color is sort of hard without trying it on yourself first.  </li>
            <li> My only caution is try not to go too heavy or you will end up looking like an extra in a vampire movie - I realized that too much made me look very pale and corpse-like.  </li>

            <li> It covers without looking like heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> It covers blemishes and the red spots on my face from broken veins and cherry angionas.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is not greasy and does not have a heavy smell.  </li>
            <li> I use the gloMinerals Camouflage brush to apply and the gloMinerals gloLoose Base in Natural to set.</li>
            <li> make the situation even worse.  </li>
            <li> I get the worst acne and noone ever noticing!</li>

            <li> I do like it, only wish it were a more light-weight consistency for even easier application. Women that worry about pulling the skin around their eye area, might not care for it so much. But it does a good job covering blemishes/imperfections, and serves as hiliter as well.</li>
            <li> I WAS RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS PRODUCT BY MY DERMOTOLOGIST TO COVER MALASMA MARKS ON MY CHEEKS. LET ME SAY THAT THE PRODUCT WORK AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because the color guide was misleading.  The concealer itself is wonderful... goes on smooth and turns matte immediately, but being fair skinned, the color was far too dark.  I&#x27;d probably buy again if they&#x27;d put up lighter colors, or show which colors work with which skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover a scar from surgery while it was healing.  The golden color was perfect for my fair skin.  I use the gloMinerals Camouflage brush to apply and the gloMinerals gloLoose Base in Natural to set. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Good concealer.  I like that when i use it or reapply it during the day I don&#x27;t feel as if it clogging my pores or will cause a breakout.  With that being said, its lasts ok throughout the day.  If I have a spot, it usually has to be completely recovered by lunchtime.  Coverage is moderate.  I use it when my skin is pretty good.  If there is something that needs to be covered well, I use something else.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and does exactly what is says!</li>
            <li> Always great, every time. Iv&#x27;e been using this product for about 5 years and it never fails. It covers up everything and lasts ages!</li>
            <li> I am so extremely happy with this product. The concealer actually hides my imperfections. I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin (almost translucent) and really really bad dark circles. Not only are they genetic, but I&#x27;m also a student, so I get hardly any sleep. I was just about to give up on finding a full overage corrective concealer until I found this! I love it to death and it will always have a place in my makeup bag. The only problem is that you must layer a flesh toned concealer over it or it&#x27;ll be shockingly yellow; you shouldn&#x27;t wear it on it&#x27;s own. All in all I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with dark circles.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful feel makes the perfect concealer and amazing highlighter</li>
            <li> It covers without looking like heavy makeup. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so this is just enough coverage for those mornings when I need under-eye concealer.</li>
            <li> Wife ordered when her&#x27;s ran out</li>
            <li> I have been using the powder and make-up in the glo Minerals line for a couple of years now and have now added the camouflage as well.  I was looking for a really good concealer and was pleased to find that the glo Minerals line has one.  We all need a little \\&quot;extra\\&quot; help now and then and knowing that the ingredients are the best made my decision pretty easy.  This product provides just the right coverage, right where I need and want it and I can be assured it will not cause any problems with my skin. It also matches perfectly the color line that I am using.  This is a winner for me!</li>
            <li> I like it . I have oily skin. So it works nicely for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It covers blemishes and the red spots on my face from broken veins and cherry angionas.  I also use it under my eyes and it makes my eyes look younger.  Highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to decide which color of Glo Minerals Camouflage I was going to buy. I consulted some other sites and did come up with the fact that Golden seems to work for very fair people.  I was a little worried it might look gold, it kind of appears that way slightly, but when I put it on it absolutely matched my fair skin tone.  I like that this is not greasy and does not have a heavy smell.  It made my skin look smooth and feel smooth.  I liked that it hid any imperfections.  This will not irritate your eyes.  I really like the fact that the minerals are supposed to be good for your skin.  I tend to try a ton of different makeups and foundations.  My skin gets very dry in the winter and I have had some makeups make the situation even worse.  Glo Minerals did not do that which was good.  Yes, I agree deciding on a color is sort of hard without trying it on yourself first.  Glo Minerals to me was really worth the money.  My only caution is try not to go too heavy or you will end up looking like an extra in a vampire movie - I realized that too much made me look very pale and corpse-like.  This is a nice, well-thought-out product that I would say is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using glominerals products for 4 years, and gloCamouflage is now on my list of must haves. I am a fair complected, (medium-toned) natural blonde, but change my hair color often (platinum, black, red and every shade in between), and Golden works great with all of my looks!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair skin and this concealer does a great job of concealing breakouts (without making them worse). Pleasant smell and great coverage.</li>
            <li> I deal with melisma, and the coverage is impressive.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fine and good with my complexion which is a mix of yellow and red tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using glominerals for 10 years now and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the makeup!  I get the worst acne and noone ever noticing!</li>
