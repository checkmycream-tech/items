            <li>The travel bag comes in handy to keep the toothbrush separate and sanitary.</li>
            <li>I used to own a Crest rotating/vibrating toothbrush and, though it&#x27;s ok, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to how good this is.</li>
            <li>That kind of grossed me out, so</li>
            <li>Travel case is a nice addition to the package.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice travel bag also.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare line of products is an effective way of brushing teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>However, it takes a set amount of time to use this effectively.</li>
            <li>However, it is my own fault for buying without the research.</li>
            <li>Thank you My son liked the gift.</li>
            <li>It has a nice grip and travel pouch.  </li>

            <li>It also comes with a convenient travel case, which comes in handy when we have to go out of town for tournaments or vacations.</li>
            <li>The absolute best electric tooth brush I ever owned.  </li>

            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Have used Sonicare for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Surely a company like Philips could come up with a better design.  </li>
            <li>I love the power on this.</li>
            <li>Love how it turns off after 2 minutes</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist is pleased as well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It really is better than a toothbrush and the dentist visits prove it.</li>
            <li>Of course, the brush heads should be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>I love their dependability and quality (you can always count on the Sonicare name).</li>
            <li>Holds a charge, cleans teeth flawlessly and will last for years.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it when i saw it in my dr&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>In my opinion, these features are sufficient for most people.  </li>
            <li>With those two aside, it is a great, inexpensive toothbrush and does what it&#x27;s suppose to really well.</li>
            <li>My dentist said after I started using Sonicare that he had never seen my teeth look better.</li>
            <li>The handle is wider than most electric toothbrushes, it&#x27;s like holding a flashlight.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and the price was really competitive too.</li>
            <li>and I love having a travel</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>ok product.</li>
            <li>Item was a gift to family member and they are pleased with product.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to turn it off before taking out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush along with it travel case.</li>
            <li>Most of my teeth are crowns, but I feel that it cleans them well.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Out of the models I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Dentist states that the gums are healedand healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the battery spin type brush that I had been using and resulted in a not so favorable dental visit.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will order one for my hubby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>OK here&#x27;s the lowdown: this will get your teeth cleaner than a manual brush ever has.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I love the timer it will automatically shutoff after two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>much better than before I used it.</li>
            <li>My family has been using this product for years, and we love the way that it cleans our teeth.  </li>
            <li>love sonicare tooth brushes</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more and upgrade to a better Sonicare or Oral B.</li>
            <li>It is much better than brushing manually.</li>
            <li>When I eventually tried it I made sure to follow the instructions provided along with suggestions from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Use the brush two minutes for the top and two minutes for the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love brushing my teeth with this</li>
            <li>Love this product and the accessories ..</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>finally content with the perfect toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dental check ups prove that this is so much better for my teeth and gums...</li>
            <li>You will save more in dental costs than you will spend on them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, with the progression of each model, Sonicare keeps adding more features which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>With more effort people can have even better results.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have seen improvements by using this toothbrush, I love brushing my teeth with this brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent 2nd one I have bought.</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, like this product :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and am fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>We have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>- I imagine my teeth would be in much better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>but this works so much better.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of getting one more for my spouse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for my boyfriend, and he love it.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>Love this electric toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t be without it now</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; toothbrush and has been for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>No whitening mode, but that is perfectly ok for $40.  </li>
            <li>Save your gums and your teeth will love you :)))))</li>
            <li>The effect can be astonishing</li>
            <li>Love my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so shiny and feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>Love um</li>
            <li>I tried many electric brushes ..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super clean, brighter and whiter, and feel great.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it massages my gums.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have discovered the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Sonicare likes to keep this style around to offer more affordable entry into the Sonicare toothbrush line.  </li>
            <li>Well, my teeth are probably as white as they are going to get because I think that all Philips Sonicare brushes do an excellent job</li>
            <li>Well, my teeth are probably as white as they are going to get because I think that all Philips Sonicare brushes do an excellent job</li>
            <li>I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes - have used them for years</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the auto shut-off after 2 minutes -</li>
            <li>My childcare healthy.</li>
            <li>I immediately purchase the rechargeable model and I love it.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth smooth and feels very clean!</li>
            <li>but they clean so much better!</li>
            <li>NOt an exact fit but charges and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this does what you would expect a Sonicare to do: Give you a nice clean brushing.</li>
            <li>Great buy and as a replacemnet for an older one</li>
            <li>It is so good and the price is unbeatable, I love it so much!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, and I was impressed at the ingenious design of the charging station...</li>
            <li>I feel like it needs to be more ergonomic to be able to hold onto easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: this design is relatively cheap and easy to use while being highly effective.</li>
            <li>the unit is easy to recharge and lasts for many, many hours.  </li>
            <li>Mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I really liked how it gradually led you up to the full setting.</li>
            <li>The concept is about having vibration help in the brushing process and as long as the user follows the instructions it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>still worth it!!</li>
            <li>Just got this new one and am still happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>The new brush is great.</li>
            <li>because I thought it would be more efficient and do a better job of removing plaque and keeping teeth and gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>More function like controlling the brushing time need to update it to advanced version, which cost more than $150.</li>
            <li>great price, fast ship, very helpful in preventing plaque build up - very satisfied &amp; would recommend</li>
            <li>he said he didn&#x27;t have to clean much of my gums because I am doing a great job.</li>
            <li>Regardless of that, Sonicare is still my favorite when it comes to electric toothbrushes and this version is a good value even with the older design.  </li>
            <li>Everything works as expected, charges well, and is the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>I can report, that so far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the cheap batter AA powered ones.  </li>
            <li>I saw this at Target for $40 and Amazon had a better deal with free shipping</li>
            <li>Im happy to say that the toothbrush has lived up to its hype so far</li>
            <li>So much better than the cheap models you get in the food store.</li>
            <li>The action of the toothbrush itself is great.  </li>
            <li>Just got this in and it is great so far.</li>
            <li>It took me some time to get used to the sound this toothbrush makes on my teeth, but now that I am they have never felt better.</li>
            <li>Needs a good 24- hours to charge before ready to use.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The cosmetics aren&#x27;t quite as nice as the Elite either, but it was under $25 (plus shipping &amp; handling of course) so if it lasts it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and transport!</li>
            <li>The product was as I expected, it came very quickly and I am very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li>Very effective so far.....</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but the rapid motion makes it a very effective brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change the head.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate,&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>, I truly love how clean my teeth get with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the 2 minute timer; my teeth and gums feel truly clean.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!!your teeth feel clean....</li>
            <li>The brush comes apart and fits easily into the pictured carrying</li>
            <li>I definitely would be happy to have paid a bit more to get those features.</li>
            <li>Keeping the brush barrel attached to the handle sets up a damp environment in which mold begins to grow very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works well, feels well-balanced in hand, and easy care product.</li>
            <li>Easy set up, just plug in, attach the brush head, and let it charge.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer really keeps me honest :)</li>
            <li>And we all love the way it keeps our teeth feeling as clean as our dentist hygienist used to do.</li>
            <li>I was really attached to the old one, but this one is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Easy setup and toothbrush charges easily.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush alway feel like my teeth are clean just like leaving the dentist.</li>
            <li>It literally chipped the plaque off and lightened the teeth very quickly without hurting their teeth.</li>
            <li>and I already need to replace the head, which easily runs $8-$10 a pop even if you buy a multi-pack.  </li>
            <li>and you end up with clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>This brush is compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>and it is fully charged very quickly.</li>
            <li>Both are easy to take along when you travel.  </li>
            <li>Both are easy to take along when you travel.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this prodcut to others.</li>
            <li>Bought a Oral B and is still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this as a superior way to promote dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the features offered in the higher models (e.g., the quad pacer) would be nice, for me (a broke graduate student)</li>
            <li>Sonicare makes the best electric toothbrushes hands down.  </li>
            <li>Five years before the battery started slowing down is excellent performance and a longer time than I</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>I have only had it a week but love how clean teeth feel, really happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is fine.</li>
            <li>I am fine with that since I onlu paid 25$ bucks for it</li>
            <li>,lef my charger at home.toothbrush worked fine.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print.</li>
            <li>Had one in high-school and now I just got this one on a super deal!</li>
            <li>We love our new electric toothbrushes-love how my teeth feel after I brush for 2 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth so clean I feel as if I just had them clean!</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and it isnt super loud.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, easy to clean, and stays charged for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the performance and price of this particular model.</li>
            <li>It works fine, and is easy to rinse and clean.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I saved the original stand and am able to use it.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge design flaw with this model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the ability to have my toothbrush plugged in all the time, so this is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li>The actual toothbrush works really great though.</li>
            <li>Most powerful toothbrush ever used</li>
            <li>But with that said, it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This thing is easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Great price for the basic model</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>I brush my teeth for a minute or so and they just feel so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that it comes with a traveling bag and seems to hold a charge for quite a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The charger light stays on if you charge over night which can be distracting if you don&#x27;t have a door between the bathroom and bedroom.  </li>
            <li>However, this cheaper model seems to have issues with the charge indicating light.</li>
            <li>This is my second Philips Sonicare product, and I have been happy with both.</li>
            <li>IT IS GREAT ONE.IT CAN MEET YOUR BASIC REQUIR OF OARAL CLEANIC.I</li>
            <li>I am kind of concerned with how to get reasonably priced replacement heads though.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great on my teeth and in just a week my teeth were so white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to let the unit do the work as you move it about your mouth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, it holds a charge well, and I&#x27;ve felt a difference in my oral health-as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tho.</li>
            <li>Happy with this toothbrush, replacing my last one which lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li>Overall tho&#x27; happy with it.</li>
            <li>The charging light  stays on all the time.</li>
            <li>others, we initially purchased a Sonicare unit because our dentist recommended it, but we stayed with it because the thing just does a great job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the newest model which would fit my needs.  </li>
            <li>I have been cavity free and had whiter teeth for years using it.</li>
            <li>It is great especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take apart ans to clean.  </li>
            <li>I also found that replacement brushes were quite reasonably-priced and available at Costco.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is much more powerful zing to it than I remember.</li>
            <li>I went through 3 of these, sending them back via Amazon (which has been great).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>important point</li>
            <li>seems cheap</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to appreciate it because of the comfortable and thorough cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush, and I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>.. Light..</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>My teeth were never so smooth.</li>
            <li>Also the travel case is kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable soft-grip handle and comes with 1 contoured brush head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called the Sonicare Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  </li>
            <li>(Frustration Free Packaging)]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all just a matter of what features are important to you.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as the 18 year old model it has replced.</li>
            <li>Sonic toothbrush is great and really feels so much cleaner afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love it, as much as one can love a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Form factor is functional, could get one more slender for twice the money but did pay for the ability to recharge as I deemed that important, being sexy not so much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So good to replace my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I used to think that oral-b was a far superior toothbrush until I tried this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth and gums feel super clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and you will feel smooth when it is working</li>
            <li>The power of it is just right and makes you want to brush more.</li>
            <li>I get it, but I don&#x27;t get it, because I clean my product every week and its fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes in the early &#x27;90s and loved it.</li>
            <li>i use it everyday,and i think it is very useful</li>
            <li>It is handy to be able to turn it on in a towel to more completely dry the brush off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not so good ,,,, its too noisy &amp; vibrate wired &amp; its very heavy too ...not so good for this price.....</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job, my mouth feels clean and my teeth could tell the difference on the first day from my old, non-Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wierd sensation at first and can be tricky in terms of learning how to use the right kind of pressure.</li>
            <li>Previous products lasted longer, fit one;s hand better to enable more effective and easy use of the brush in the mouth.</li>
            <li>originally, the tooth brush lasted 5 months</li>
            <li>Toward the end, my original Sonicare stayed in the charging cradle after each use.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original in 2001; the body and charger lasted until autumn of 2013 with nary a problem.</li>
            <li>My original one had this feature</li>
            <li>The tooth brush arrived just on time, inside original packaging.</li>
            <li>It is a littlle unnerving when first being used, but once you are accustomed to it, it is OK.</li>
            <li>replaced an original sonicare brush from ~2003.</li>
            <li>First, it costs more to replace the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for years and My dentist was pleased at how well it cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li>As long as you take your time and be diligent you will have great results.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and may keep you out of the Periodontist chair and that will save you pain and $1,000&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>and now I get excited to use my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, the original had a sturdy case for the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li>thing to keep in mind when you are considering one is the cost of this model compared to the thinner, lighter, and better designed higher priced models.  </li>
            <li>And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start</li>
            <li>I know that my teeth is routinely clean and my breath never stinks, score!</li>
            <li>With practice, I see that it is very effective at vibrating particles out from between my teeth and brushing is much quicker than with a manual brush; not excessive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have to clean and maintain the inside every couple days unless you want to smell mold</li>
            <li>If you are not unscrewing it once per week to clean inside</li>

            <li>do my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen all the instructions about how to clean this every week</li>

            <li>My teeth are squeaky clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Small brush head makes it easier to clean the molars all the way in the back.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The travel caps for the brush heads also help keep the toothbrush clean inside our toiletry bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you do have to clean it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two models in how they clean.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two models in how they clean.  </li>
            <li>They clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years and have nothing but positive things to say about them; the Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this toothbrush because you get amazing professional looking results in one day!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>Love this great price and we needed a more compact size for traveling The handel and the brush same size but the charger was smaller.</li>
            <li>My stained teeth has lightened up significantly, certainly nothing close to that of a trip to the dentist but still better than what you could do with manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>If you turn the brush on with paste before putting it in your moutg, it will vibrate right off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed how clean my teeth are after using it and love the 2min timer feature.</li>
            <li>It is able to do a thorough clean for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;additionally, it does not consume too much electricity.&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
            <li>this is my first Sonicare tooth brush, teeth feel clean and whiter!</li>
            <li>They all have provided a great clean feeling and really make a huge difference from a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very fine product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>so clean (so fresh and so clean clean)</li>
            <li>the noise it makes are a bit too loud, otherwise the item is good for clearing my teeth, better then my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li>This one was closest to the model I had and was the most reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>REALLY like this one better.</li>
            <li>However, I find the timer essential for good brushing habits and, in my opinion, this gets your teeth</li>
            <li>I have always taken good care of my teeth, but this toothbrush made my teeth feel like I had just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>And, these are more reasonably priced than some of the sonicare line.</li>
            <li>Good enough for beginner.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic inexpensive unit.</li>
            <li>According to the manual, the brush allows 12 uses before it switches to full strength, but I didn&#x27;t notice that.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the way it cleans - it can be credited with reversing gum damage for one family member.</li>
            <li>I feel it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as the manual toothbrush did, but it is adequate.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t true with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>Love this product Thanks</li>
            <li>you have to replace the whole top part [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>gets teeth super clean.</li>
            <li>The handle is slender and so it is easy to maneuver, the product is light in weight, and it is much quieter than the HX6711 model, which I bought by mistake intending to buy another one of these.  </li>
            <li>It came very quickly and was exactly as it was represented.</li>
            <li>and I know that my check-ups have improved greatly over the years by using Sonicare in contrast to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This is the latest version of the original Sonicare design, where each replacement of the brush head comes with a new set of magnets.</li>
            <li>The entry level new design corrects both of these problems and is available on Amazon for about $10 more than this one -- and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>but, you will have so much fun cleaning your teeth that you will be eager to clean them as soon as you can.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and fresh plus it keeps the plaque in check.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vastly improved handle and brush in comparison with my former brush, as well a the best price I found by comparison.</li>
            <li>This one is just as great as the old and the old charger works with it too.  </li>
            <li>The fresh magnets are as important as the fresh bristles.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for</li>
            <li>Overall, the Sonicare Essence 5600 is an excellent basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as promised and is a worthy buy.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>One is the heads tend to wear out quickly and are costly to replace.</li>
            <li>third generation (current) is truly the best.  </li>
            <li>This model is reasonably priced and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I might eventually buy one of the more high end models of sonicare</li>
            <li>There are many features that come along with it and a warranty, so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It was my very first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy the price has come down from 150.00,</li>
            <li>The new one performs well and we expect to get many years of dependable service.</li>
            <li>We love our new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love my new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>All in all I am satisfied with the new brush.</li>
            <li>I just love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn out two previous ones, this replacement is great.</li>
            <li>It would not hold a charge for more than maybe 2 days of brushing, and even when fully charged it was much weaker than when first purchased.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>First one lasted almost 10 years!</li>
            <li>For a first toothbrush more sophisticated than bristles on a stick, its simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essence 5600 is styled like the original first generation.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your teeth clean and feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>There is a considerable amount of vibration in the brush shaft, so it is no wonder they needed a very secure attachment.</li>
            <li>Well, after the first use, he noticed a difference on how clean his teeth feel and he loves it.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product</li>
            <li>I had a very good experience with their healthy white product, but I settled for this model to save a few bucks, but that was a mistake.  </li>
            <li>my hygienist said i had some abrasion on my teeth and that it was probably caused form too much pressure with the toothbrush, so she suggested to try a cheap electric tooth brush to see if i could get used to to it</li>
            <li>Purchased this because I noticed my veneers haven&#x27;t been looking as great as when I got them a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few months but now won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But its well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be a luxury, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It can save you in dentist bills far more than the price for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The charging station is pretty cool - it seems to leverage wireless charging since there are no connections between the station and the brush.  </li>
            <li>Better than any old toothbrush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I gets my money worth.</li>
            <li>Getting fresh magnets with each head keeps the unit working like new,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It needs to be recharged more frequently than every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I got this present from my sister and although I was expecting so much more, I realized that this tooth brush was a gateway towards a better future that includes better hygiene and girl friends (without the space-</li>
            <li>The neck of it is thinner, which makes it more comfortable to hit your back teeth.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a high-power electric toothbrush but let me tell you this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li>Now it is up to full speed (after the first 12 uses).  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>(a distinct shortcoming of this toothbrush is that one can not replace the battery).  </li>
            <li>This is an old model and does not have many features.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Oral B old one I had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is powerful.</li>
            <li>theyre just so fresh</li>
            <li>They all have them for their own children now and use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like buying a computer printer for next to nothing, and then having to spend a fortune on the ink cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the functions on the $200 one are as useful as described.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator which would be useful to know when recharging required.</li>
            <li>As far as the teeth cleaning goes, I love Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;basic&#x27; unit is heavier than the &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic toothbrush, I love using it.  </li>
            <li>My old one had better bristles.</li>
            <li>Better design than the old one.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels really good as it brushes against your teeth and gums, you can really feel it cleaning it your mouth and massaging your gums.</li>
            <li>You can work up to the full effect if it&#x27;s your first experience with electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love brushing with electronic tooth brushes, but I was surprised that this model does not beep every 15 or 30 seconds  intervals. .</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to, but worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Using an electric tootbrush has changed all that, and my dentist says I have minimal plaque and excellent daily care.  </li>
            <li>I notice this particular one also is easy to find replacement toothbrushes in Target and Publix, when needed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>We bought extra heads so we can interchange the heads so each member of the family has their own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying that it is not too sharp/hard nor too soft</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Those with very sensitive teeth might give this a pass as it does create a good deal of vibration and it will become very apparent when using the brush on your front</li>
            <li>Our original Sonicare finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>brushes every clean, better than the oral B I used to use, if offers much cleaner brushing</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after using it, I actually brush more than before.  </li>
            <li>Hope this one lasts just as long, because I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>this one is much louder than the original.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the price was right.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the right ones</li>
            <li>right now-</li>
            <li>this product has gotten right.</li>
            <li>That along with the price makes this the right choice.</li>
            <li>, just right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to see how the power of the brushing improves when you put on a new head.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a bit of compromise in the brushing between this and the more deluxe versions that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price a long with a 10 dollar coupon.</li>
            <li>My teeth really feels thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>it really could help to clean my tooth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare technology really gets your teeth not just clean, but polished.</li>
            <li>great little toothbrush !</li>
            <li>I used to think electric toothbrushes were too foofy or high maintenance for me but now I&#x27;VE SEEN THE LIGHT</li>
            <li>Feels like you get a professional clean from the dentist every time!</li>
            <li>It feel like I get a professional clean every time I brush!</li>
            <li>This really cleans teeth much better than can be done with a regular (or a cheap electric) toothbrush.</li>
            <li>First off it just feels powerful when using it on your teeth</li>
            <li>does a better job than I apparently can do manually.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay, because i&#x27;ll have white teeth- which is pretty cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it cleans my teeth much more effectively than a traditional toothbrush or a basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my honest about how long I spend brushing.</li>
            <li>The other Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve used also had a pretty good feature--it&#x27;d buzz when it was time to move from one surface side to another.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is quite good after cleaning for a day or two but then slows down as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulates inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>now you have to clean your glasses, the mirror, and pretty much everything within 3 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I forces you to get an amazing clean throughout your entire mouth every single teeth get squeaky Clean!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get a deal on a good electric toothbrush because I could finally get my dentist off my back about it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new one that would fit those heads.  </li>
            <li>Huge mistake!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Essence is no where near as powerful as the HealthyWhite and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets your teeth fully cleaned.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>It holds a great charge for I&#x27;ve taken it on several trips and not had to recharge after several days of usage.  </li>
            <li>Since I had my children, my gums have been exceptionally sensitive and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the vibrations and it is easy to clean (which you need to do regularly).  </li>
            <li>Having come from the Elite model of Philips Sonic Care, I miss the Quadpacer beep reminder at 30 second intervals; but this model does the same great job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Combine</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it is a very good value relative to the other fancier models.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this tooth bush for a change so far it has been working just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, despite the more effective and more comfortable head, these are plagued with the problem of mold, bacteria, and just general funk under the rubber seal.  </li>
            <li>This was actually a good head, although it rattled/buzzed if you made the little plastic guard/plate touch the moving brush head.  </li>
            <li>My first one worked great, but the battery on the new one gave out after less than a year.  </li>
            <li>very good experience so far, solid improvement versus regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine toothpaste and water trickling down the inner components of this brush being very good for longevity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit surprising that this larger model with the older style brush head connection is still around and being sold as new.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the older version this model does offer a travel pack and better grip, but doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much else new.  </li>
            <li>It may have made the huge difference they noticed from my old model.</li>
            <li>I have used a Sonicare for many years and finally it just stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>One can reverse gum deterioration with the consistent use of this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>well the gums have more to do with regular flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember, you only need to brush and floss the teeth you want to keep :)</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and I am replacing it with the Philips Sonicare EasyClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a different model and this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriends teeth are probably getting whiter, and while dentistry and gum disease is only a hobby of mine, I&#x27;m confident that we&#x27;re making progress on that front as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using the sonicare toothbrush since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>After the first time you use it, you feel as if you went for a rigorous teeth cleaning at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>just exactly what you think you are paying for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted andneeded</li>
            <li>My first soniccare tooth brush</li>
            <li>This was my second Sonicare Essence toothbrush, and it is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li>It did take over a month to see results with my first one.</li>
            <li>First e-brush ever.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner than it did before!  </li>
            <li>so I can make sure that I am actually brushing the recommended time.  </li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush didn&#x27;t have this feature and it took me awhile to get used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time i use Philips Sonicare and</li>
            <li>Our first lasted for 5 years, then died.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted many years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It recharges well - took 24 hours the first time, and charges within a day now.  </li>
            <li>Better than regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush, but I have used many different electric toothbrushes over the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Sonicare has kept this basic design</li>
            <li>It last a lot, way more that two weeks, and I like that it goes off automatically after two minutes, so you know that you&#x27;ve done your job.</li>
            <li>I especially like that this one is much more packable.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a more solid product.</li>
            <li>I swear my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and every use.</li>
            <li>if I felt up to it) to brushing three times a day, after meals, after showers, after getting the mail... pretty much just for the heck of it!</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are brushed more thoroughly, and gum doesn&#x27;t get hurt in the process.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush first give $10 discount</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 5-6 years before it stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>just place it on top) such that it&#x27;s tilted, allowing the insides to air out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the more simple one speed sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare that alerts you @ 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted nineteen years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time in my life, I can&#x27;t wait to brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you go Sonicare you can&#x27;t go back. :)</li>
            <li>This one would be even better if it had the 30 second beep while brushing.</li>
            <li>First let me start with</li>
            <li>Always have gone above and beyond to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li>The point is that the head lets moist in upon its first exposure to water.</li>
            <li>And, it has an \\&quot;adaptability\\&quot; feature so that the first 12 uses it gradually introduces you to the feeling of a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Exactly 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is the most basic unit that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It does not have any 30 second timer like the more upgraded units have to notify you to change brushing locations.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m more tolerant to it now, or it just doesn&#x27;t affect me the same.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants their teeth feeling cleaner each day!</li>
            <li>Our first one like this lasted seven years and my wife and I use it two times a day each.  </li>
            <li>It much better that the last model.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to take the plunge and invest in a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is something that happens in all sonic care toothbrushes, and is not something that consumers are aware of when making purchases.</li>
            <li>I really love the Sonicare, especially after my semi-annual checkups.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is FAST!</li>
            <li>This brush works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the first one&#x27;s battery started to go.  </li>
            <li>I was an oral b user for years and never thought about using sonicare until the battery consistently crapped out.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush so despite the fact I have to replace more often than in the past I am buying another.</li>
            <li>then do not panic, as I did, the first time you use it and it sort of hurts.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m a satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li>This was a gift because I love my second sonicare</li>
            <li>It has a 2 minute auto-shut off timer, so you make sure and brush the amount of time you should, and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>First, make use of the timer provided.</li>
            <li>Second, make sure your angle your brush against the teeth in a way that works the gum line as well.</li>
            <li>Owned several Sonicare products over the years and have always been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>So much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dentist to promote healthy gums (especially for my age at 60</li>
            <li>I really would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>This thing is intense!</li>
            <li>Got my first one 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li>My dentist noticed the difference from the first visit after I got it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Recently I had migrated to Oral B finding the size, hand feel, and vigorous motion more to my liking.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve had a model without a built in timer.</li>
            <li>Although that makes it dummy proof when to switch from the front to back, top to bottom, this toothbrush works just as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomended!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what is says it is.  </li>
            <li>My first electric tooth brush and</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this one style and she has to flush out the head connection with hot water to get all of that out, or replace the head itself.  </li>
            <li>I have the thinner higher priced whitening model and it does not have this design</li>
            <li>Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  </li>
            <li>But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li>original price for original basic model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Further, the top part i noticed has a space</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>My last checkup was much better.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, the first time it felt like my gums were being tickled, but that went away once I was used to it.</li>
            <li>otherwise spend a little bit more for the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with a little carrying case that appears to be able to hold the toothbrush and the charging station (I haven&#x27;t actually tried it to see if they all fit.....), and the toothbrush comes apart easily for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid, very straightforward, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>cool feature for anyone new to using an electric toothbrush is the Ramp-up mode.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has everything right except for the part that it gets so much mold.</li>
            <li>My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out.  </li>
            <li>Overall is good, only the sound is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>My old Phillips Sonicare Elite toothbrush lasted several years and I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I originally planned to purchase just a replacement handle, but saw this complete package with a travel pouch, brush head and charger for under $50 and then discovered a $10 discount code and that sealed the deal.  </li>
            <li>I have owned other Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in sum, this has good battery technology, but you will have to be careful not to leave it in the charger and make sure you run it down.  </li>
            <li>I hope this one can hold up as well and so far my teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how clean my teeth felt afterward.  </li>
            <li>But it cleans as good as the more expensive toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>To me this brush is just as good as the Elite line of the more expensive Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>A good solid toothbrush, my second one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush while it lasts but it gets only 3 stars because it DOESN&#x27;T last.</li>
            <li>The head itself is also a little smaller which helps it fit and turn more easily.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a deep clean without breaking the bank, this is the brush for you!</li>
            <li>At first, you will feel an intense tickling sensation but you will get used to it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is pretty much the entry unit into the Sonicare line of products.  </li>
            <li>I love how long the battery lasts on this product.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to higher cost Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Pretty much it is just a pouch with a zipper.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that not only did I buy the same one again</li>
            <li>This one does almost as good, but since I have a small mouth the longer head doesn&#x27;t quit get to all my teeth as well.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity was gone by the fourth time i brushed, and I love the way my teeth feel so much now, after brushing, that I brush much more frequently throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>Once you use this product, you can never go back to a regular toothbrush because it does a terrific job cleaning your teeth and is most effective.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts a very long time using it in this manner, so you don&#x27;t have to find a plugin often, the unit is lightweight, and the results are truly worthwhile for your dental health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing out the brush and handle assembly after each use isn&#x27;t all that burdensome, either: it takes less than 30 seconds, and is easily done as you give the unit the same kind of rinse you would give any toothbrush after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a simple, easy to use rechargeable electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Even with the above precaution of dismantling the brush after each use, one must actually clean both open parts with a q-tip about once a week to be sure there isn&#x27;t a speck of mold lurking in the mechanism.</li>
            <li>After nearly a decade I finally found a suitable replacement.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is a simple version and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>However, for me, it made my teeth became so SUPER sensitive after just 5 days of use that just breathing through my mouth</li>
            <li>They screw on to the brush and have a large opening inside the head that collects moisture.</li>
            <li>Be smart, be timely, and be clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a smart toothbrush.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am certain this brush does everything is should.</li>
            <li>I have an older sonicare that I like very much.</li>
            <li>It works great, but the product&#x27;s appearance sucks!</li>
            <li>What sets the &#x27;basic&#x27; model apart from my &#x27;deluxe&#x27; Sonicare is seemingly minor, but is worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing twice as fast and easy as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>breath is super fresh, and lots of people have been commenting on how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li>Battery seems to last a long time, I have my charger put away most the time and pull it out very rarely.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good deal when I placed my order, but the toothbrush stopped working properly last month (only 4 months after purchase) and now a fully charged battery only gets me two brushing sessions at full power before the power drains.</li>
            <li>I must have missed reading the fine print since the last time I bought this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve had a lot of different &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34; before and they&#x27;ve all been fine.</li>
            <li>so well you&#x27;ll more than likely save on going to the dentist as less cavities are sure to be a side effect of using this combined with perhaps an air/water pik.</li>
            <li>For example, I use a Sonicare HealthyWhite 3 Mode toothbrush, which has a setting for Clean, Sensitive, and Clean and White.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Philips/Sonicare has discontinued the original style head and gone with a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; head that fits both the first and second generation toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I had the standard battery operated model and it was fine</li>
            <li>The first one I owned was purchased around 8 years ago and had the older NiCad battery technology which eventually died.  </li>
            <li>but it was exactly what I needed, a replacement handle &amp; brush for my older Sonicare  toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Would very highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>now i wont stop using this nice tooth brush, i think heads replacement are a little pricey but</li>
            <li>The little case is really handy because I travel a lot.  </li>
            <li>This is the easiest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, comes apart to make a nice compact little package for traveling.  </li>
            <li>This one has a nice little carrying case.  </li>
            <li>This one has a nice little carrying case.  </li>
            <li>After the first time he used it, he told me he never brushed his tooth so clean.</li>
            <li>it seems a little more powerful than my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it seems a little more powerful than my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like a snowmobile that isn&#x27;t particularly designed to work in cold weather: it drives perfectly for 10 miles before the water in the radiator just freezes no matter what you do.</li>
            <li>With its simple setup and easy-to-understand instructions, this electric toothbrush does a great job without being too harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>The vibration of this toothbrush had swept away all the stuff my traditional toothbrush was missing, and it was great for my gums too.  </li>
            <li>Huge difference between this and using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I smooth toothpaste over teeth before starting it up and found that works well.</li>
            <li>I used it until the light started blinking (telling me that the charge was low).</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>My teeth were so much whiter after just one week.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>This one really turned me around on electric toothbrushes though.</li>
            <li>My teeth appear much cleaner as well.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys using it.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this - it is a turbo-toothbrush</li>
            <li>Our aunt received this as a gift and likes it much.  </li>
            <li>Saves me time and so much energy.</li>
            <li>The brush is very vigorous and feel like you got a dentist-style cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the charging rate is fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this unit for the size of the brush head.</li>
            <li>But this unit does take a week or so to really get used to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenience for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>They really need to add an o-ring or something to keep this watertight.</li>
            <li>It just runs 2 minutes straight thru.</li>
            <li>I chose the Essence because I had extra brush heads that fit</li>
            <li>The brush works very well otherwise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>(I get ready in the morning on another floor because that is where my closet is--</li>
            <li>This and a water pic have REALLY improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses the Essence.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two beeps that start the timer are almost inaudible unless you&#x27;re really listening closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out of guilt, I went online hours before i was scheduled to see my dentist, and hastily purchased the best-rated toothbrush with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li>whole process takes like 12 seconds and costs about a tenth of a calorie, so don&#x27;t even worry about</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is really worked out</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and will be using it for years to come.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Cleans really well.</li>
            <li>I used a Sonicare toothbrush about 5 years ago but got away from it because the replacement heads cost too much.</li>
            <li>We really like this.</li>
            <li>He really likes to use the Sonic toothbrush and so do I.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Holds a charge, and cleans the teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vigorous and gentle.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get all the bells and whistles this time but don&#x27;t really miss them.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that I really find my self</li>
            <li>I thought that was unusual, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>I keep it on the charger each day so it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I like this so much</li>
            <li>Timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 performs very well.  </li>
            <li>And yes they do take some getting used to, and don&#x27;t ever start the brush unless it is IN your mouth, unless you enjoy cleaning your bathroom, especially the mirror!</li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth feel much cleaner than they did with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now it can&#x27;t be fully charged -- normally it only takes ~4hrs to fully charge, but this time it&#x27;s already charged for 24 hours and the light is still flashing...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>No annoying thirty-second blips or multiple settings to fiddle around with.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After one week, my gums are healthier, my mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The vibration takes some time to get used to, but my teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>just go it, really like it</li>
            <li>and I guess it&#x27;s doing what my dentist wants it to do...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s absolutely it.</li>
            <li>I really like having this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>purchased at Amazon and the price was affordable, shipping fast.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t understand why I spent so many years without one.</li>
            <li>vibrates a lot - gives very tingly feeling to the teeth - it also had very unpleansat touch to the teeth when stem hits you.</li>
            <li>This is important because if you push a button twice to cycle it and turn it off while it is in the middle of changing modes, instead of it turning off, it turns on, and your spit and toothpaste go flying, so</li>
            <li>It also needs to be charged very infrequently.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this it goes to fast in your mouth</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is accomplished using a magnetic actuator.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I received it in a very timely manner through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel much cleaner after using manuals for years..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it ..</li>
            <li>You can really feel and see the results.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>as expected , quality with a refreshing vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li>but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Charged the toothbrush and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have owned Sonicares for years, probably bought 6-7 of them and my whole family has them.  </li>
            <li>I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t have that, but I didn&#x27;t really pay that much attention to it anyway.</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t have that, but I didn&#x27;t really pay that much attention to it anyway.</li>
            <li>As far as the brush goes, it is okay for a basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, it is a really nice change over the traditional simple brush.</li>
            <li>If you want more time but want to set it to a different fixed value, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I will be good for at least a year.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and hope this one lasts as long as the last one which was around 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>hope this one last as many years as old one did,,</li>
            <li>This new offering from Philips has reversed that for me, the brush is slimmer and feels better in the hand that other recent models and I am pleased with how clean and well brushed my teeth and gums feel after use.  </li>
            <li>Why the heck Sonicare didn&#x27;t include that simple and very useful aspect to this is beyond me.</li>
            <li>and this type is not very expensive.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to keep track how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Love the head and head action, but messy mildrew clean up.</li>
            <li>It is actually very pleasant and far less abrasive than other cheaper vibrating toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li>The only practical and discernible difference between this one and my original Sonicare is that it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is better then the other brand .</li>
            <li>suggest you look at other more durable brands..</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth better than any other electric toothbrush that I have ever used</li>
            <li>However, this one does not have the 60 second interval timer that my original one had.</li>
            <li>Other models have slightly more features.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the manual and other electric brushes,</li>
            <li>This is my second one after a few years, pretty good deal for this brush</li>
            <li>It has fewer bells and whistles than some of the other models, but, as a result, it seems to be more reliable and durable.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>original finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth and is not too big to fit in the small areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li>But once you are past the initial uncomfortableness, it works great.</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic buzz was pretty odd at first, but it gets our teeth smooth like when you get them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Totally makes my teeth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It gets teeth really clean in a way that only a dental visit can surpass.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel clean using a regular toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li>It works fine but vibrates allot &amp; feels a bit strange.</li>
            <li>Third, after brushing use the massage setting along with mouthwash to finish off with a clean mouth.</li>
            <li>With these you occasionally had to unscrew the head and clean them out (with an old-style toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I tend to brush my teeth for over 2 minutes, which helps me get that &#x27;extra&#x27; clean feel.  </li>
            <li>It totally leaves your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>The whole toothbrush isn&#x27;t as compact as my older model either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it about 5-6 months and my teeth don&#x27;t look or feel as clean as others i have used.</li>
            <li>Wish the charge would last a  little longer, but overall really nice - love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>It has a very obnoxious high pitched buzzing noise as well.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a present and the person using it was able to remove large blemishes on their teeth after several uses.</li>
            <li>easy start feature made it simple for even my 7 year old to get used to using this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up</li>
            <li>&#x27;deluxe&#x27; model has a small &#x27;beep&#x27;</li>
            <li>A full charge can last all week.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and have always been optimistic about them, but when I started using my Sonicare, it made a world of a difference and completely changed my opinion.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is nice, but the bristles seem a little soft.  </li>
            <li>Before trying it I had reservations about the extreme tickling I experienced in a brief trial several years ago.  </li>
            <li>It brings my lazyness to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>I previously owned a quad-pacer model which lasted more than five years.</li>
            <li>I now have no issues when I see my dentist, whereas before my teeth typically needed more work.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, about the size of a Wii remote.</li>
            <li>If you do, then you don&#x27;t have to pay more than $50 (or $100 for some) for a product that essentially does the same thing.</li>
            <li>Now she won&#x27;t use her old toothbrush (I&#x27;m cheap, I only use the Sonicare in the evening and a manual one in the morning.)</li>
            <li>No serious problems.</li>
            <li>Although this is an older model toothbrush it works well for my needs.</li>
            <li>Will know more with my next check-up and cleaning scheduled for next month.</li>
            <li>My last dentist visit was significantly better than when I was using a regular brush</li>
            <li>The charger works well but takes up a decent amount of counter space.</li>
            <li>No serious dental problems.</li>
            <li>Particularly like the carrying case as we travel quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace my husbands older one that broke</li>
            <li>30 seconds on the top teeth on the outside, 30 second on the top teeth on the inside of your mouth, 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the outside, and finally 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the inside of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothbrush is nice to hold, not loud and holds a charge for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>After using a regular ol toothbrush for many years, I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Works well and quieter than my older model.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find the same part number so it would fit my old charger</li>
            <li>, I usally dont write exaggurated reviews, but after being to the dentist and discussing my issues, mainly being lack of ability to reach/</li>
            <li>Rather than get a newer model for lots more money, I looked around for an older one that costs less.</li>
            <li>The photograph next to this review is INCORRECT; my Model 5610 is much more slender and does not have the big dome shape below the brush head as is shown in this photo.  </li>
            <li>, I believe this is the older model</li>
            <li>If price is your main consideration over all else, this is the model...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a two minute timer like my older model.  </li>
            <li>Ive got very sensitive gums and this toothbrush really helps with not bleeding in addition to whitening your teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not pleased with the cost of the brushes, but it obviously is a complicated unit; it would be nice if Sonicare came up with a replacement brush that more easily removes from the shaft, so that there is less to replace (the replacement brushes from Sonicare include the entire shaft with screw on assembly; there are aftermarket brushes that pull apart from the shaft, apparently with great difficulty).  </li>
            <li>Like many products today this &amp;#34;newer and improved&amp;#34; electric toothbrush is less sturdy and less easy to use than the original version or even the last version before this.</li>
            <li>brush is pretty quiet and does a fantastic job of getting my pearly whites just that - white.</li>
            <li>my dentist wise surmised that I want it to keep in its current condition as long as possible and he recommended Sonicare as stacking the deck in my favor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product since it cleans</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>really nice product!but much more expensive than the one sold in Walmart!</li>
            <li>What I do like better about this model is that the movement is a little stronger than my older model, the brush seems to move faster and have a little more power.  </li>
            <li>My first mechanical toothbrush, so I have no other device to compare it to besides the manual brush.</li>
            <li>Other models cost more, but don&#x27;t declare a higher performance, just a different style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough compactness ensures a good grip and the simplicity of its \\&quot;control interface\\</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my very old previous Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>but I just clean and dry it once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed mold developing.</li>
            <li>I have never been happy with this product and now find its useless.</li>
            <li>now I take it apart and clean it and dry it every day.</li>
            <li>So, if you need a reminder on when it&#x27;s time to switch sections of the mouth (and it&#x27;s worth $30+ to you), then you can upgrade to the next model.</li>
            <li>Though there are more sophisticated models on the market, I&#x27;m not sure why the average person would need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems as powerful as my former model.</li>
            <li>the toothbrush just sits atop the charger, and charges without having to be positioned just so, or making sure Part A is nestled firmly against Part B.</li>
            <li>This is where a lot of normal brushing misses.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bothered, as I&#x27;m sure it would be a waste of time.</li>
            <li>Love it but the brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li>initial week of using electric toothbrushes did need some getting used to since your entire mouth is vibrating rapidly, but after that week I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>That said, I was less than thrilled to find that the various parts of the toothbrush are NOT watertight, and will admit water, toothpaste, and saliva.</li>
            <li>run this over your teeth slowly, now scrubbing, and BAM, sparkling clean and clean feeling teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price, only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have the automatic 30 second notification like my other one.</li>
            <li>right now, the charge only lasts for about 20 seconds on 3 hour charge.</li>
            <li>Luckily, since I have been using that one for years, I sort of know the pattern and how long to park on each tooth.</li>
            <li>It is that exact same toothbrush I had for much less than I originally paid for my first one.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a practical toothbrush for more than an individual simply because there&#x27;s no place to store an extra toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and after just a few days, previous problems with bleeding gums are gone completely!</li>
            <li>i like it and it takes a little time to be used with the sound and vibration, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The first time using the toothbrush it slowly works its way up in intensity for the first 12 uses before going to full power.</li>
            <li>On time and new as stated.</li>
            <li>I have been using one for over 10 years and can say that it does live up to its reputation.  </li>
            <li>and I will have to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li>Instead of trying to replace its battery, just figured we&#x27;d go for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one is working well and we look forward to years of service from it.</li>
            <li>I chose to replace my Sonicare Essence 5600 with a new one.  </li>
            <li>Since I alredya had soem new heads</li>
            <li>and I am getting used to the new brush.</li>
            <li>I mentioned I just got a brand new Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but that turned out to be no problem because they send a new charger for it as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to school to become a Dental Hygienist and always looking for new toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I did this with the new brush after a 24 hour change.</li>
            <li>I&lt;br /&gt;immediately started shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this and replacing the heads</li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner now when i go in to the dentist, and my gums are also doing better since I know longer brush to hard.</li>
            <li>The other 3 are the FlexCare, Healthy White, and the older Elite models.  </li>
            <li>The older attachments I had for the old Sonicare are compatible with this new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference, would never go back to my regular toothbrush again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product and its predecessor so much that I&#x27;ve purchased others and given them as gifts, and my dental hygienist remarked that I had less plaque and tartar buildup on my last visit to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>I love this little toothbrush!</li>
            <li>the noise is VERY loud</li>
            <li>Brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>On/off button very sensitIve.</li>
            <li>I purchased it right after moving out my old apartment because I only need just ONE toothbrush rather than two!</li>
            <li>I had extra brush heads for my old Sonicare, so it was important to me to purchase a new unit that would use the same brush head.</li>
            <li>The only difference with this model is it does not have timed sequences like my original model - not a big deal.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my first sonicare that stopped holding a charge after several years.  </li>
            <li>I had the first brush forever and when it finally bit the dust I didn&#x27;t think twice, I ordered and another.</li>
            <li>Usually when I brush my teeth manually, I will finish soon, but electric one can make sure brushing 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the first one finally stopped working (it worked for years)</li>
            <li>The basic model does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>For the first week of two it does feel like you just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;After using this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model</li>
            <li>It is not expensive, especially if it can help save your teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a particularly lazy or disorganized person, but this toothbrush didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>First, the handle itself is much larger in diameter.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in upgrading.</li>
            <li>WoW!</li>
            <li>I usually rely more on the appearance of the brush head than the color indicator that supposedly show when a brush head should be replaced.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>will do an update in the future, as I often do for those interested in longevity.</li>
            <li>Unlike the first generation which used NiCad batteries, this uses NiMH batteries which was used in the second generation.  </li>
            <li>Many people cannot get past that</li>
            <li>FIRST ONE AFTER 8 YEARS FINALLY BIT THE DUST.  </li>
            <li>There have been several generations of Sonicare, and up until the most recent generation, they had two critical flaws in my book, and this model shares those flaws:  </li>
            <li>Keep your mouth closed, and brush bent over the sink!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>People complain about the inside getting gross, but that&#x27;s because they themselves are gross and don&#x27;t clean it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth operation, seems to last a long time on a charge, and my teeth are quite noticeably cleaner than from using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A lot less clunky than the cheap battery powered electric I was using.</li>
            <li>Retail prices are astronomical, Amazons are half the cost and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>You can actually hear and feel the difference at the different settings, e.g., the sensitive setting doesn&#x27;t vibrate as vigorously as the clean setting.  </li>
            <li>We bought our 3rd Sonicare after the first worked itself to death (old A series lasted for 3 or 4 years) and</li>
            <li>think the design of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes are actually flawed and this older head design is far superior.</li>
            <li>This photo does look like the HX6711 model I bought, which is heavy, bulky, noisy and has an uncomfortably strong vibration during use.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is very loud and sensitive and takes a while to get used too</li>
            <li>The only other time my mouth has felt this clean is by visiting the dentist them self!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the same accumulations of plaque in certain areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all just a matter of what features are important to you.l had little pauses that you could hear after each 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Works as intended, you will need to clean it as the part under the screw down replacement head gets damp (that&#x27;s what mold likes to grow in, damp places).</li>
            <li>you have to change the heads, then it will you 40 to 50 dollars for six new brush heads and its hard to clean!</li>
            <li>Say good-bye to gingivitis and bad breath and say hello to happiness and success.</li>
            <li>Maybe my teeth are extra sensitive, but I found the vibration to be too much to handle.</li>
            <li>Yes there&#x27;s a bit leaking but every time when I change the brush head I would clean and dry it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old one, which lasted almost five years.</li>
            <li>toothbrush came completely uncharged.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than if I use a regular brush</li>
            <li>She was in complete agreement.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I found this toothbrush and it works just as well as my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Works just like my old sonicare elite brush.</li>
            <li>But people with sensitive teeth may want to find another model.</li>
            <li>It vibrates really loud.</li>
            <li>I never had this problem with old spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>It seems to hold charge longer than my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and has a internal timer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about the Philips Sonicare toothbrush until my last visit with my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are so much clearer than traditional brushing.  </li>
            <li>But, I think most users would know that piece of common sense</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li>So, now I am ordering another one for my 20 year old.</li>
            <li>It does collect there just like in the old model</li>
            <li>I replaced an old one that I had for years.</li>
            <li>The head vibrates too loudly.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning, but I bet he will like the effects as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with 2 brushes in case one gets too soft.</li>
            <li>Met all my expectations and was considerably cheaper online.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I only read the reviews on the whole unit, and didn&#x27;t think to read those about the replacement toothbrush heads themselves.  </li>
            <li>So far, no problems.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 10 year old son.</li>
            <li>The charger is also bigger because the HealthyWhite came with a separate travel charger that was really compact.  </li>
            <li>Broke my old one.</li>
            <li>Feels much cleaner and the battery actually stays charged!</li>
            <li>Those are so far below this, they are incomparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sonic action of the brush forces water between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Your mouth is left feeling much cleaner and the automatic timer helps to ensure you brush for the recommended two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for nearly a month</li>
            <li>After 6 years, my old one just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Really like the smaller head.</li>
            <li>The brush head is soft and seems to be doing its job</li>
            <li>Dentist visits have dropped considerably since we have been using this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>All told, it takes about 5-6 minutes to complete the process.</li>
            <li>MY OLD SONICARE DIED AFTER 13 YEARS...</li>
            <li>You have to get used to the &amp;#34;sonic feel&amp;#34; as it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a standard toothbrush going over your teeth.  </li>
            <li>At least 10X better, although it looks kinda MacGyver&#x27;ed.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 11 year old daughter and</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews saying it worked for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Also, the rechargeable battery appears to be completely sealed off from the charger (no metal contacts to corrode).</li>
            <li>This seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>It was like my old one</li>
            <li>This was a replacement unit for a 5 year old one</li>
            <li>I bough this to replace my old Sonicare elite, which I have had for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>My whole family have switched from traditional toothbrush to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Before I used an electric toothbrush, I was having real problems with plaque, despite having regular dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li>I like the old version, like this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I am also surprised</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Does it get my teeth whiter than the old model?  </li>
            <li>Does it get my teeth whiter than the old model?  </li>
            <li>There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version.  </li>
            <li>the essence model is basic but that&#x27;s all one really needs.</li>
            <li>okay, one of the key features I like about Sonicare brushes is missing.</li>
            <li>The action is just right, not too hard, but effective enough to get the grit and film off my teeth left by my numerous medications.</li>
            <li>I take the charger for anything over a week, but other than that it seems to last just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, sorry to digress, but I have UNIVERSALLY found that the best model with in each generation is the most simple one without all the feature-laden whistles and bells, ridiculous UV cleaners, etc., which just drive up your cost both initial and in consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that stopped being able to hold a charge long enough for a single brushing.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare brushes were old and it was cheaper to buy this entire kit, than to find replacement brush heads for the older model.</li>
            <li>It is small and easy to maneuver in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I could have purchased just the charger, but for just a little extra money I was able to buy an entire new electric toothbrush unit.  </li>
            <li>Doing this will effectively &#x27;pattern&#x27; the battery to where it will hold less and less of a charge.</li>
            <li>This was purchased to replace an much older American made Sonicare that gave up the ghost from shear old age.</li>
            <li>: Why get an expensive gadget, when I can do the exact same thing on my own, for a fraction of the price?</li>
            <li>Second one of these I&#x27;ve owned (the first one lasted a long time and is still holding a charge but my dentist suggested I get a new one)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully the new unit lasts as long as our first one did; if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be back here to update the review accordingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I was floored that this new Sonicare is not only heavier and bulkier than my 6 year old Oral B electric toothbrush but also considerably louder.</li>
            <li>I diligently kept using it, three times a day, and after a few days, I got used to the vibrating sensation, and started to appreciate how clean my teeth felt after brushing.</li>
            <li>no one else will make the same mistake i did buy buying this particular model</li>
            <li>I had the first generation Sonicare, which finally died on me after nearly ten years.</li>
            <li>It really gyrates pretty heavily and you will want to turn it off before taking it out of your mouth unless you want specks of toothpaste all over you and your bathroom counter/mirror.</li>
            <li>kidding aside, the bristle action is firm but not painful.</li>
            <li>I replaced the same toothbrush, as the older one no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li>particular unit, the HX5610/01, is actually my 2nd Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The 3rd replacement we recently bought is a 2 handle one that we charged for first 24 hours and then used - without recharging - over 60, 2 min.</li>
            <li>We then switched out the first handle for a totally charged second handle that is then used for another 60-ish uses.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately in the past I have equated more technical features and higher price with better.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace an older one which was starting to have a shorter battery life after five years of use.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my sister since I have the same exact one which I purchased at BedBathBeyond for a similar price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the holder is to large for the hand and it becomes hard to use the handle should be made smaller to fit in your hand</li>
            <li>I tried screwing it on different way and making sure it is tight etc but still the same problem.</li>
            <li>It vibrates at such a high frequency.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the older one would hold a charge because it was compact enough to take the whole thing along when we traveled</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the older one would hold a charge because it was compact enough to take the whole thing along when we traveled</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did.  </li>
            <li>HAPPENS OVERNITE AND IS NOT EASY TO CLEAN IT OFF.</li>
            <li>I clean mine in a jar of alcohol weekly and keep it open as much as possible to dry out.</li>
            <li>It did take a longer than expected time to charge the first time but have not had problems with charging since.</li>
            <li>, it has a cheap feeling base, I am wondering how long it will last, it feels cheap, which is a shame because the body of the brush (the fat part you hold) feels much more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Coming from a normal toothbrush the feeling is much different and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to ever go back to using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like that the brush assembly is more expensive to replace and more difficult to disassemble and clean.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like that the brush assembly is more expensive to replace and more difficult to disassemble and clean.</li>
            <li>Its about the only model I had yet to purchase and try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped on a new head and gave it a try and after having for two years it was still powerful and did not bog down with any amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>After nine years my last one died and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have used these for the last 2 years and they still work like new.</li>
            <li>Finally bought a new one</li>
            <li>This new one has updated Lithium battery technology, which should last longer without the NiCad memory effect (I hope).  </li>
            <li>The manual says to take the brush head off every week to air dry it, but who really has the time to do that?</li>
            <li>The healthy white model lasted at least three years.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that replacement heads are rather pricey, but that seems to be the case with most electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s old toothbrush completely lost its charge after 10 years and he insisted on getting this similar model to replace it.  </li>
            <li>The only difference was the blue coloring on this one, but it&#x27;s a toothbrush who really cares about the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care about all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any need for the additional features offered on the more expensive</li>
            <li>but I had bought so many things that I was forced to send it back because I didn&#x27;t have a use for it.  </li>
            <li>This is the third sonicare I have purchased in type last 10 years all have lasted twice a day brushing for at least 4 years looking at the other models they pretty much are the same with some fancy bells and whistles for more money.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, the neck is very delicate, so be careful when traveling :)</li>
            <li>Purchase of the original set is very cost-effective, but the cost of additional brush heads when you need to change them (you DO change your toothbrush regularly, yes?!) is pretty darned expensive.  </li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush is lightweight, easily charged, portable and the smaller brush is easier to use in small spaces.  </li>
            <li>The price was just right, this tooth brush is an investment, less trips to the dentist office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The original first generation toothbrushes used an open sort of toothbrush head with a plate behind the brush.  </li>
            <li>Even with daily cleaning there is black slimy bold inside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again particularly if it was more expensive than the sale price ($25).</li>
            <li>I replaced an older, more expensive model that had lasted for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how long this one last but the guarantee for the 2 1/2 yrs certainly helps.</li>
            <li>Only downer is I take it on the road everywhere and they no longer provide the hard plastic travel case, and the one from my old unit doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>very useful and can be used in long time after charged, it&#x27;s convenient to a little bag when travlling.</li>
            <li>Or perhaps the charging process in general is finicky.</li>
            <li>The ability to slowly adjust your teeth and gums to the sonic pulses is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>One model old but still terrific.</li>
            <li>my dentist reccomends using an electric toothbrush with a &#x27;extra soft&#x27; head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned several Sonicare and this is by far the model to NOT get.</li>
            <li>I had been using the same sonicare toothbrush since I was probably about 9 years old</li>
            <li>I ordered this one because the old one finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>My old one finally pooped out.</li>
            <li>Also toothpaste seems to spray everywhere if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an 3 year old oral B for the same reason.</li>
            <li>I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li>Not fun first thing in the morning pre-coffee.</li>
            <li>I wish it had the 30 second timer that my old one had, letting you know to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even consider taking my old one, it is almost as big as my curling iron!</li>
            <li>One of the things i noticed after using this brush was that my breath actually improved even though i wasn&#x27;t brushing anymore frequently.</li>
            <li>I was replacing my old Philips electric toothbrush where the battery had finally died</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth actually feel like they do after a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Old sonicare finally dies afte about 12 years so time for replacement.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has been recommending this for ever, finally got one and WOW</li>
            <li>This is my second as the old motor wore out after two+ years.  </li>
            <li>second (E series) pooped out before it was 2 years old.</li>
            <li>My two complains are: the charger barely holds the brush in place</li>
            <li>I especially like the way the drive motor is sealed off, in fact, completely isolated, from the brush.</li>
            <li>Several months later I had my teeth cleaned and the hygenist asked me what I had been doing different because I had too much plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m harsh with stars, I rarely give 5s, so don&#x27;t fret).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you like moldy water collecting inside your brush which I am sure leaks into the bristles when you are using it...if you are confused by this, google it and you will be grossed out.</li>
            <li>Also the charging stand is flimsy compared with the older one (which, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t work with the newer one), and despite my fastidious attempts to clean the bottom of the toothbrush each time before replacing it in the charger, enough toothpaste residue persists which acts like glue so that when you pick up the toothbrush to use it again the whole charge apparatus comes up with it,  stuck to the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li>Purchased this model less than 2 months ago and with twice daily use and regular charging, the battery no longer lasts a full two minutes without needing another charge.</li>
            <li>it also is relatively inexpensive if you are new to Sonicare, but your next one will want to be the Li-Ion versions.  </li>
            <li>They really help my dental health because I have a dry mouth which required extra care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and we love that the charging base isn&#x27;t overcomplicated for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this toothbrush is really designed for a single person or for an individual who travels.</li>
            <li>The only quibble is battery life (it&#x27;s a NiCad device with the usual issues with battery memory) and you need to keep the device clean.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products, I feel like this price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>how much battery life is left--I do appreciate the other Sonicare brushes with the battery life LED levels.</li>
            <li>Hard to keep it clean though.  </li>
            <li>I delayed as long as possible in buying a new one because the last new one, a different model from Costco, didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Towards the end it seemed to slow down and needed cleaning more frequently as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulated inside.  </li>
            <li>Because batteries and wirings have improved in the last decade, with this new unit I plan to fully charge it for 48 hours and then use it daily but let it set out of the charger for four or five days, in hopes that will help the battery last longer.</li>
            <li>If you are new to Sonicare just remember one thing, the replacement heads are not cheap compared to the actual cost of the whole Sonicare brush itself.</li>
            <li>So, when the battery died recently (nearly 20 years later), I definitely wanted to purchase another Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss is the 20 to 30 second &amp;#34;advance&amp;#34; for each quadrant like the old model.</li>
            <li>My old one finally died after years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Actually the heads last considerably longer than what is recommended by Sonicare.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely too early to make a solid judgement.</li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel so clean when I know that there&#x27;s a thick layer of mold growing in my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The seller did not state that this Soniccare product was an old version (maybe the 1st generation) which requires much more expensive replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is that the replacement heads are kind of expensive and it seems like I will be replacing the heads every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>I have had many different electric toothbrushes and this is the worse one i have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I will highly recommended, specially if you have kids, because it really will forced them to keep the toothbrush in their mouth until it turns off!!!</li>
            <li>I have also used every major generation of Sonicare toothbrush and several models within each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, because it is less complicated, this model is very affordable compared to some of the other models, but it leaves your teeth just as smooth and clean as the others.  </li>
            <li>She said that it did not really give her the clean that she had with the old Sonicares that she&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works great for me, the price is right and helps out my terrible tooth situation.</li>
            <li>The seam where you  open in the middle gets a big gunky, a quick wipe is needed after a few washes.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t charge totally up and then discharge totally DOWN, the batteries will become less able to hold a long charge and you will be replacing a lot sooner than you would otherwise.</li>
            <li>For those not wanting to spend a lot on a brush this version offers long batter life, two minute timer, charging indicator, and travel pouch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to admit, it had been 5 years since my last dental visit a few years back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I still use the traditional toothbrush when I travel just to save weight in my bag and its noticeable when you switch between electric and hand toothbrushes, I subconsciously feel that my teeth are not as clean when I use the traditional toothbrush after using the Sonicare for the past</li>
            <li>I scrape between my teeth with one of those metal tooth picks in a couple of my problem areas, then set the sonicare in that spot (quite lightly, mainly using the sonic action) for a few cycles.</li>
            <li>really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still prefer this to the other $80 sonicare models because of the price mainly.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 6 years, second one 4 years, third one only lasted 3 years so the quality has gone down.</li>
            <li>It does get a little gunky inside, so you have to clean it out regularly, other than that</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare makes less noise and is much lighter compared to spin brush.</li>
            <li>Phillips designed it so that you have to replace about half of the whole unit, and they charge you accordingly.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH STRONGER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE</li>
            <li>and if you are conscious of water getting in and dry off the brush head after every use, you will never encounter this problem.</li>
            <li>This allows your gums to slowly get adjusted to the action of the brush head over the first twelve uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the basic model of a Sonicare, but you really don’t need all of the bells and whistles that come with other models!</li>
            <li>my teeth had when first using this toothbrush, but THE GROSS BLACK MOLD that forms EVERY TIME underneath the brush head just is NOT ACCEPTABLE!</li>
            <li>The major advantage this model has over all the other models I&#x27;ve owned is that it has stronger action in the brush head.  </li>
            <li>my old one had, I like knowing that I brushed long enough.</li>
            <li>This is the bare bones, no frills version of the Sonicare, without any of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no travel charger, no UV cleaning feature, no extra heads or color-code rings, and no audible signal or vibration for the 30 second change-</li>
            <li>, it is very easy for it to fall down, so I have to put it on a flat surface to charge; also, the brush was very hard on my gums for first few days, but now I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic.  </li>
            <li>This brush goes above and beyond cleaning your teeth, you can feel it really get into the tight spots as you glide over your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 years old, and never had one single cavity!</li>

            <li> My dentist recommends this kind of brush.</li>
            <li> This one fits nicely into its INCLUDED case.</li>
            <li> My husband bought one of these and talked me into buying one of my own.  </li>

            <li> The travel bag comes in handy to keep the toothbrush separate and sanitary.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Crest rotating/vibrating toothbrush and, though it&#x27;s ok, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to how good this is.</li>
            <li> That kind of grossed me out, so</li>
            <li> Travel case is a nice addition to the package.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice travel bag also.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare line of products is an effective way of brushing teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> However, it takes a set amount of time to use this effectively.</li>
            <li> However, it is my own fault for buying without the research.</li>
            <li> Thank you My son liked the gift.</li>
            <li> It has a nice grip and travel pouch.  </li>
            <li> Use at your own risk, yada, yada.)  </li>

            <li> It also comes with a convenient travel case, which comes in handy when we have to go out of town for tournaments or vacations.</li>
            <li> The absolute best electric tooth brush I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Another nice thing was that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> was so happy with the comfort, ease, and clean feeling</li>

            <li> I love this tooth brush along with it travel case.</li>
            <li> Most of my teeth are crowns, but I feel that it cleans them well.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Out of the models I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Dentist states that the gums are healedand healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the battery spin type brush that I had been using and resulted in a not so favorable dental visit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will order one for my hubby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> OK here&#x27;s the lowdown: this will get your teeth cleaner than a manual brush ever has.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> I love the timer it will automatically shutoff after two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> much better than before I used it.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for years, and we love the way that it cleans our teeth.  </li>
            <li> love sonicare tooth brushes</li>
            <li> Spend a bit more and upgrade to a better Sonicare or Oral B.</li>
            <li> It is much better than brushing manually.</li>
            <li> When I eventually tried it I made sure to follow the instructions provided along with suggestions from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Use the brush two minutes for the top and two minutes for the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth with this</li>

            <li> I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> finally content with the perfect toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental check ups prove that this is so much better for my teeth and gums...</li>
            <li> You will save more in dental costs than you will spend on them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, with the progression of each model, Sonicare keeps adding more features which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> With more effort people can have even better results.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have seen improvements by using this toothbrush, I love brushing my teeth with this brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent 2nd one I have bought.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, like this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and am fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> We have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> - I imagine my teeth would be in much better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> but this works so much better.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of getting one more for my spouse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my boyfriend, and he love it.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> Love this electric toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t be without it now</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; toothbrush and has been for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No whitening mode, but that is perfectly ok for $40.  </li>
            <li> Save your gums and your teeth will love you :)))))</li>
            <li> The effect can be astonishing</li>
            <li> Love my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so shiny and feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love um</li>
            <li> I tried many electric brushes ..</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super clean, brighter and whiter, and feel great.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it massages my gums.  </li>
            <li> So glad to have discovered the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Sonicare likes to keep this style around to offer more affordable entry into the Sonicare toothbrush line.  </li>
            <li> Well, my teeth are probably as white as they are going to get because I think that all Philips Sonicare brushes do an excellent job</li>
            <li> Well, my teeth are probably as white as they are going to get because I think that all Philips Sonicare brushes do an excellent job</li>
            <li> I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes - have used them for years</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the auto shut-off after 2 minutes -</li>
            <li> My childcare healthy.</li>
            <li> I immediately purchase the rechargeable model and I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth smooth and feels very clean!</li>
            <li> but they clean so much better!</li>
            <li> NOt an exact fit but charges and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this does what you would expect a Sonicare to do: Give you a nice clean brushing.</li>
            <li> Great buy and as a replacemnet for an older one</li>
            <li> It is so good and the price is unbeatable, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, and I was impressed at the ingenious design of the charging station...</li>
            <li> I feel like it needs to be more ergonomic to be able to hold onto easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: this design is relatively cheap and easy to use while being highly effective.</li>
            <li> the unit is easy to recharge and lasts for many, many hours.  </li>
            <li> Mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it gradually led you up to the full setting.</li>
            <li> The concept is about having vibration help in the brushing process and as long as the user follows the instructions it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> still worth it!!</li>
            <li> Just got this new one and am still happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> The new brush is great.</li>
            <li> because I thought it would be more efficient and do a better job of removing plaque and keeping teeth and gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> More function like controlling the brushing time need to update it to advanced version, which cost more than $150.</li>
            <li> great price, fast ship, very helpful in preventing plaque build up - very satisfied &amp; would recommend</li>
            <li> he said he didn&#x27;t have to clean much of my gums because I am doing a great job.</li>
            <li> Regardless of that, Sonicare is still my favorite when it comes to electric toothbrushes and this version is a good value even with the older design.  </li>
            <li> Everything works as expected, charges well, and is the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> I can report, that so far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the cheap batter AA powered ones.  </li>
            <li> I saw this at Target for $40 and Amazon had a better deal with free shipping</li>
            <li> Im happy to say that the toothbrush has lived up to its hype so far</li>
            <li> So much better than the cheap models you get in the food store.</li>
            <li> The action of the toothbrush itself is great.  </li>
            <li> Just got this in and it is great so far.</li>
            <li> It took me some time to get used to the sound this toothbrush makes on my teeth, but now that I am they have never felt better.</li>
            <li> Needs a good 24- hours to charge before ready to use.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The cosmetics aren&#x27;t quite as nice as the Elite either, but it was under $25 (plus shipping &amp; handling of course) so if it lasts it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and transport!</li>
            <li> The product was as I expected, it came very quickly and I am very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li> Very effective so far.....</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but the rapid motion makes it a very effective brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy to change the head.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate,&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> , I truly love how clean my teeth get with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the 2 minute timer; my teeth and gums feel truly clean.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!your teeth feel clean....</li>
            <li> The brush comes apart and fits easily into the pictured carrying</li>
            <li> I definitely would be happy to have paid a bit more to get those features.</li>
            <li> Keeping the brush barrel attached to the handle sets up a damp environment in which mold begins to grow very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works well, feels well-balanced in hand, and easy care product.</li>
            <li> Easy set up, just plug in, attach the brush head, and let it charge.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer really keeps me honest :)</li>
            <li> And we all love the way it keeps our teeth feeling as clean as our dentist hygienist used to do.</li>
            <li> I was really attached to the old one, but this one is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Easy setup and toothbrush charges easily.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush alway feel like my teeth are clean just like leaving the dentist.</li>
            <li> It literally chipped the plaque off and lightened the teeth very quickly without hurting their teeth.</li>
            <li> and I already need to replace the head, which easily runs $8-$10 a pop even if you buy a multi-pack.  </li>
            <li> and you end up with clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> This brush is compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> and it is fully charged very quickly.</li>
            <li> Both are easy to take along when you travel.  </li>
            <li> Both are easy to take along when you travel.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this prodcut to others.</li>
            <li> Bought a Oral B and is still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this as a superior way to promote dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the features offered in the higher models (e.g., the quad pacer) would be nice, for me (a broke graduate student)</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes the best electric toothbrushes hands down.  </li>
            <li> Five years before the battery started slowing down is excellent performance and a longer time than I</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> I have only had it a week but love how clean teeth feel, really happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is fine.</li>
            <li> I am fine with that since I onlu paid 25$ bucks for it</li>
            <li> ,lef my charger at home.toothbrush worked fine.</li>
            <li> Read the fine print.</li>
            <li> Had one in high-school and now I just got this one on a super deal!</li>
            <li> We love our new electric toothbrushes-love how my teeth feel after I brush for 2 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth so clean I feel as if I just had them clean!</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and it isnt super loud.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to clean, and stays charged for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the performance and price of this particular model.</li>
            <li> It works fine, and is easy to rinse and clean.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I saved the original stand and am able to use it.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge design flaw with this model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the ability to have my toothbrush plugged in all the time, so this is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> The actual toothbrush works really great though.</li>
            <li> Most powerful toothbrush ever used</li>
            <li> But with that said, it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This thing is easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Great price for the basic model</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth for a minute or so and they just feel so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that it comes with a traveling bag and seems to hold a charge for quite a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The charger light stays on if you charge over night which can be distracting if you don&#x27;t have a door between the bathroom and bedroom.  </li>
            <li> However, this cheaper model seems to have issues with the charge indicating light.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare product, and I have been happy with both.</li>
            <li> IT IS GREAT ONE.IT CAN MEET YOUR BASIC REQUIR OF OARAL CLEANIC.I</li>
            <li> I am kind of concerned with how to get reasonably priced replacement heads though.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great on my teeth and in just a week my teeth were so white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to let the unit do the work as you move it about your mouth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, it holds a charge well, and I&#x27;ve felt a difference in my oral health-as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tho.</li>
            <li> Happy with this toothbrush, replacing my last one which lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li> Overall tho&#x27; happy with it.</li>
            <li> The charging light  stays on all the time.</li>
            <li> others, we initially purchased a Sonicare unit because our dentist recommended it, but we stayed with it because the thing just does a great job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the newest model which would fit my needs.  </li>
            <li> I have been cavity free and had whiter teeth for years using it.</li>
            <li> It is great especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Easy to take apart ans to clean.  </li>
            <li> I also found that replacement brushes were quite reasonably-priced and available at Costco.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is much more powerful zing to it than I remember.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 of these, sending them back via Amazon (which has been great).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> important point</li>
            <li> seems cheap</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to appreciate it because of the comfortable and thorough cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush, and I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> .. Light..</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> My teeth were never so smooth.</li>
            <li> Also the travel case is kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable soft-grip handle and comes with 1 contoured brush head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called the Sonicare Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  </li>
            <li> (Frustration Free Packaging)]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all just a matter of what features are important to you.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as good as the 18 year old model it has replced.</li>
            <li> Sonic toothbrush is great and really feels so much cleaner afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love it, as much as one can love a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Form factor is functional, could get one more slender for twice the money but did pay for the ability to recharge as I deemed that important, being sexy not so much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So good to replace my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I used to think that oral-b was a far superior toothbrush until I tried this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth and gums feel super clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and you will feel smooth when it is working</li>
            <li> The power of it is just right and makes you want to brush more.</li>
            <li> I get it, but I don&#x27;t get it, because I clean my product every week and its fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes in the early &#x27;90s and loved it.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday,and i think it is very useful</li>
            <li> It is handy to be able to turn it on in a towel to more completely dry the brush off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not so good ,,,, its too noisy &amp; vibrate wired &amp; its very heavy too ...not so good for this price.....</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job, my mouth feels clean and my teeth could tell the difference on the first day from my old, non-Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wierd sensation at first and can be tricky in terms of learning how to use the right kind of pressure.</li>
            <li> Previous products lasted longer, fit one;s hand better to enable more effective and easy use of the brush in the mouth.</li>
            <li> originally, the tooth brush lasted 5 months</li>
            <li> Toward the end, my original Sonicare stayed in the charging cradle after each use.</li>
            <li> I purchased the original in 2001; the body and charger lasted until autumn of 2013 with nary a problem.</li>
            <li> My original one had this feature</li>
            <li> The tooth brush arrived just on time, inside original packaging.</li>
            <li> It is a littlle unnerving when first being used, but once you are accustomed to it, it is OK.</li>
            <li> replaced an original sonicare brush from ~2003.</li>
            <li> First, it costs more to replace the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted for years and My dentist was pleased at how well it cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li> As long as you take your time and be diligent you will have great results.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and may keep you out of the Periodontist chair and that will save you pain and $1,000&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> and now I get excited to use my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, the original had a sturdy case for the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> thing to keep in mind when you are considering one is the cost of this model compared to the thinner, lighter, and better designed higher priced models.  </li>
            <li> And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start</li>
            <li> I know that my teeth is routinely clean and my breath never stinks, score!</li>
            <li> With practice, I see that it is very effective at vibrating particles out from between my teeth and brushing is much quicker than with a manual brush; not excessive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to clean and maintain the inside every couple days unless you want to smell mold</li>
            <li> If you are not unscrewing it once per week to clean inside</li>
            <li> my teeth  are clean now .</li>
            <li> This puppy will really clean your teeth.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve seen all the instructions about how to clean this every week</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B before this and it never got my teeth as clean as this brush does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The travel caps for the brush heads also help keep the toothbrush clean inside our toiletry bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you do have to clean it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two models in how they clean.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two models in how they clean.  </li>
            <li> They clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years and have nothing but positive things to say about them; the Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush because you get amazing professional looking results in one day!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> Love this great price and we needed a more compact size for traveling The handel and the brush same size but the charger was smaller.</li>
            <li> My stained teeth has lightened up significantly, certainly nothing close to that of a trip to the dentist but still better than what you could do with manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> If you turn the brush on with paste before putting it in your moutg, it will vibrate right off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed how clean my teeth are after using it and love the 2min timer feature.</li>
            <li> It is able to do a thorough clean for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;additionally, it does not consume too much electricity.&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
            <li> this is my first Sonicare tooth brush, teeth feel clean and whiter!</li>
            <li> They all have provided a great clean feeling and really make a huge difference from a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very fine product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> so clean (so fresh and so clean clean)</li>
            <li> the noise it makes are a bit too loud, otherwise the item is good for clearing my teeth, better then my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li> This one was closest to the model I had and was the most reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> REALLY like this one better.</li>
            <li> However, I find the timer essential for good brushing habits and, in my opinion, this gets your teeth</li>
            <li> I have always taken good care of my teeth, but this toothbrush made my teeth feel like I had just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> And, these are more reasonably priced than some of the sonicare line.</li>
            <li> Good enough for beginner.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic inexpensive unit.</li>
            <li> According to the manual, the brush allows 12 uses before it switches to full strength, but I didn&#x27;t notice that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the way it cleans - it can be credited with reversing gum damage for one family member.</li>
            <li> I feel it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as the manual toothbrush did, but it is adequate.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t true with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Love this product Thanks</li>
            <li> you have to replace the whole top part [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> gets teeth super clean.</li>
            <li> The handle is slender and so it is easy to maneuver, the product is light in weight, and it is much quieter than the HX6711 model, which I bought by mistake intending to buy another one of these.  </li>
            <li> It came very quickly and was exactly as it was represented.</li>
            <li> and I know that my check-ups have improved greatly over the years by using Sonicare in contrast to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is the latest version of the original Sonicare design, where each replacement of the brush head comes with a new set of magnets.</li>
            <li> The entry level new design corrects both of these problems and is available on Amazon for about $10 more than this one -- and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> but, you will have so much fun cleaning your teeth that you will be eager to clean them as soon as you can.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh plus it keeps the plaque in check.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vastly improved handle and brush in comparison with my former brush, as well a the best price I found by comparison.</li>
            <li> This one is just as great as the old and the old charger works with it too.  </li>
            <li> The fresh magnets are as important as the fresh bristles.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for</li>
            <li> Overall, the Sonicare Essence 5600 is an excellent basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and is a worthy buy.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> One is the heads tend to wear out quickly and are costly to replace.</li>
            <li> third generation (current) is truly the best.  </li>
            <li> This model is reasonably priced and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I might eventually buy one of the more high end models of sonicare</li>
            <li> There are many features that come along with it and a warranty, so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was my very first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy the price has come down from 150.00,</li>
            <li> The new one performs well and we expect to get many years of dependable service.</li>
            <li> We love our new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Love my new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> All in all I am satisfied with the new brush.</li>
            <li> I just love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn out two previous ones, this replacement is great.</li>
            <li> It would not hold a charge for more than maybe 2 days of brushing, and even when fully charged it was much weaker than when first purchased.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> First one lasted almost 10 years!</li>
            <li> For a first toothbrush more sophisticated than bristles on a stick, its simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essence 5600 is styled like the original first generation.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your teeth clean and feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> There is a considerable amount of vibration in the brush shaft, so it is no wonder they needed a very secure attachment.</li>
            <li> Well, after the first use, he noticed a difference on how clean his teeth feel and he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product</li>
            <li> I had a very good experience with their healthy white product, but I settled for this model to save a few bucks, but that was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> my hygienist said i had some abrasion on my teeth and that it was probably caused form too much pressure with the toothbrush, so she suggested to try a cheap electric tooth brush to see if i could get used to to it</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I noticed my veneers haven&#x27;t been looking as great as when I got them a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few months but now won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But its well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to be a luxury, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It can save you in dentist bills far more than the price for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The charging station is pretty cool - it seems to leverage wireless charging since there are no connections between the station and the brush.  </li>
            <li> Better than any old toothbrush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I gets my money worth.</li>
            <li> Getting fresh magnets with each head keeps the unit working like new,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It needs to be recharged more frequently than every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this present from my sister and although I was expecting so much more, I realized that this tooth brush was a gateway towards a better future that includes better hygiene and girl friends (without the space-</li>
            <li> The neck of it is thinner, which makes it more comfortable to hit your back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a high-power electric toothbrush but let me tell you this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li> Now it is up to full speed (after the first 12 uses).  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> (a distinct shortcoming of this toothbrush is that one can not replace the battery).  </li>
            <li> This is an old model and does not have many features.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Oral B old one I had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is powerful.</li>
            <li> theyre just so fresh</li>
            <li> They all have them for their own children now and use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like buying a computer printer for next to nothing, and then having to spend a fortune on the ink cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the functions on the $200 one are as useful as described.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator which would be useful to know when recharging required.</li>
            <li> As far as the teeth cleaning goes, I love Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;basic&#x27; unit is heavier than the &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic toothbrush, I love using it.  </li>
            <li> My old one had better bristles.</li>
            <li> Better design than the old one.  </li>
            <li> It actually feels really good as it brushes against your teeth and gums, you can really feel it cleaning it your mouth and massaging your gums.</li>
            <li> You can work up to the full effect if it&#x27;s your first experience with electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love brushing with electronic tooth brushes, but I was surprised that this model does not beep every 15 or 30 seconds  intervals. .</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to, but worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Using an electric tootbrush has changed all that, and my dentist says I have minimal plaque and excellent daily care.  </li>
            <li> I notice this particular one also is easy to find replacement toothbrushes in Target and Publix, when needed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> We bought extra heads so we can interchange the heads so each member of the family has their own</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying that it is not too sharp/hard nor too soft</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Those with very sensitive teeth might give this a pass as it does create a good deal of vibration and it will become very apparent when using the brush on your front</li>
            <li> Our original Sonicare finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> brushes every clean, better than the oral B I used to use, if offers much cleaner brushing</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using it, I actually brush more than before.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts just as long, because I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> this one is much louder than the original.</li>
            <li> Oh well, the price was right.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the right ones</li>
            <li> right now-</li>
            <li> this product has gotten right.</li>
            <li> That along with the price makes this the right choice.</li>
            <li> , just right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to see how the power of the brushing improves when you put on a new head.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a bit of compromise in the brushing between this and the more deluxe versions that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price a long with a 10 dollar coupon.</li>
            <li> My teeth really feels thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> it really could help to clean my tooth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare technology really gets your teeth not just clean, but polished.</li>
            <li> great little toothbrush !</li>
            <li> I used to think electric toothbrushes were too foofy or high maintenance for me but now I&#x27;VE SEEN THE LIGHT</li>
            <li> Feels like you get a professional clean from the dentist every time!</li>
            <li> It feel like I get a professional clean every time I brush!</li>
            <li> This really cleans teeth much better than can be done with a regular (or a cheap electric) toothbrush.</li>
            <li> First off it just feels powerful when using it on your teeth</li>
            <li> does a better job than I apparently can do manually.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay, because i&#x27;ll have white teeth- which is pretty cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it cleans my teeth much more effectively than a traditional toothbrush or a basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my honest about how long I spend brushing.</li>
            <li> The other Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve used also had a pretty good feature--it&#x27;d buzz when it was time to move from one surface side to another.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is quite good after cleaning for a day or two but then slows down as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulates inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now you have to clean your glasses, the mirror, and pretty much everything within 3 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forces you to get an amazing clean throughout your entire mouth every single teeth get squeaky Clean!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get a deal on a good electric toothbrush because I could finally get my dentist off my back about it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new one that would fit those heads.  </li>
            <li> Huge mistake!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Essence is no where near as powerful as the HealthyWhite and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets your teeth fully cleaned.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> It holds a great charge for I&#x27;ve taken it on several trips and not had to recharge after several days of usage.  </li>
            <li> Since I had my children, my gums have been exceptionally sensitive and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the vibrations and it is easy to clean (which you need to do regularly).  </li>
            <li> Having come from the Elite model of Philips Sonic Care, I miss the Quadpacer beep reminder at 30 second intervals; but this model does the same great job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Combine</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it is a very good value relative to the other fancier models.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this tooth bush for a change so far it has been working just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, despite the more effective and more comfortable head, these are plagued with the problem of mold, bacteria, and just general funk under the rubber seal.  </li>
            <li> This was actually a good head, although it rattled/buzzed if you made the little plastic guard/plate touch the moving brush head.  </li>
            <li> My first one worked great, but the battery on the new one gave out after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> very good experience so far, solid improvement versus regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine toothpaste and water trickling down the inner components of this brush being very good for longevity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit surprising that this larger model with the older style brush head connection is still around and being sold as new.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the older version this model does offer a travel pack and better grip, but doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much else new.  </li>
            <li> It may have made the huge difference they noticed from my old model.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare for many years and finally it just stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> One can reverse gum deterioration with the consistent use of this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> well the gums have more to do with regular flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, you only need to brush and floss the teeth you want to keep :)</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and I am replacing it with the Philips Sonicare EasyClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had a different model and this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriends teeth are probably getting whiter, and while dentistry and gum disease is only a hobby of mine, I&#x27;m confident that we&#x27;re making progress on that front as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare toothbrush since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> After the first time you use it, you feel as if you went for a rigorous teeth cleaning at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> just exactly what you think you are paying for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted andneeded</li>
            <li> My first soniccare tooth brush</li>
            <li> This was my second Sonicare Essence toothbrush, and it is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li> It did take over a month to see results with my first one.</li>
            <li> First e-brush ever.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner than it did before!  </li>
            <li> so I can make sure that I am actually brushing the recommended time.  </li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush didn&#x27;t have this feature and it took me awhile to get used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time i use Philips Sonicare and</li>
            <li> Our first lasted for 5 years, then died.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted many years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It recharges well - took 24 hours the first time, and charges within a day now.  </li>
            <li> Better than regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush, but I have used many different electric toothbrushes over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Sonicare has kept this basic design</li>
            <li> It last a lot, way more that two weeks, and I like that it goes off automatically after two minutes, so you know that you&#x27;ve done your job.</li>
            <li> I especially like that this one is much more packable.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a more solid product.</li>
            <li> I swear my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and every use.</li>
            <li> if I felt up to it) to brushing three times a day, after meals, after showers, after getting the mail... pretty much just for the heck of it!</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are brushed more thoroughly, and gum doesn&#x27;t get hurt in the process.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush first give $10 discount</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 5-6 years before it stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> just place it on top) such that it&#x27;s tilted, allowing the insides to air out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the more simple one speed sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare that alerts you @ 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted nineteen years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the first time in my life, I can&#x27;t wait to brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you go Sonicare you can&#x27;t go back. :)</li>
            <li> This one would be even better if it had the 30 second beep while brushing.</li>
            <li> First let me start with</li>
            <li> Always have gone above and beyond to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li> The point is that the head lets moist in upon its first exposure to water.</li>
            <li> And, it has an \\&quot;adaptability\\&quot; feature so that the first 12 uses it gradually introduces you to the feeling of a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Exactly 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the most basic unit that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It does not have any 30 second timer like the more upgraded units have to notify you to change brushing locations.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m more tolerant to it now, or it just doesn&#x27;t affect me the same.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants their teeth feeling cleaner each day!</li>
            <li> Our first one like this lasted seven years and my wife and I use it two times a day each.  </li>
            <li> It much better that the last model.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to take the plunge and invest in a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is something that happens in all sonic care toothbrushes, and is not something that consumers are aware of when making purchases.</li>
            <li> I really love the Sonicare, especially after my semi-annual checkups.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is FAST!</li>
            <li> This brush works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> the first one&#x27;s battery started to go.  </li>
            <li> I was an oral b user for years and never thought about using sonicare until the battery consistently crapped out.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush so despite the fact I have to replace more often than in the past I am buying another.</li>
            <li> then do not panic, as I did, the first time you use it and it sort of hurts.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m a satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift because I love my second sonicare</li>
            <li> It has a 2 minute auto-shut off timer, so you make sure and brush the amount of time you should, and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> First, make use of the timer provided.</li>
            <li> Second, make sure your angle your brush against the teeth in a way that works the gum line as well.</li>
            <li> Owned several Sonicare products over the years and have always been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> So much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist to promote healthy gums (especially for my age at 60</li>
            <li> I really would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> This thing is intense!</li>
            <li> Got my first one 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed the difference from the first visit after I got it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Recently I had migrated to Oral B finding the size, hand feel, and vigorous motion more to my liking.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve had a model without a built in timer.</li>
            <li> Although that makes it dummy proof when to switch from the front to back, top to bottom, this toothbrush works just as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomended!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what is says it is.  </li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush and</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this one style and she has to flush out the head connection with hot water to get all of that out, or replace the head itself.  </li>
            <li> I have the thinner higher priced whitening model and it does not have this design</li>
            <li> Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  </li>
            <li> But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li> original price for original basic model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Further, the top part i noticed has a space</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> My last checkup was much better.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, the first time it felt like my gums were being tickled, but that went away once I was used to it.</li>
            <li> otherwise spend a little bit more for the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a little carrying case that appears to be able to hold the toothbrush and the charging station (I haven&#x27;t actually tried it to see if they all fit.....), and the toothbrush comes apart easily for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid, very straightforward, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> cool feature for anyone new to using an electric toothbrush is the Ramp-up mode.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has everything right except for the part that it gets so much mold.</li>
            <li> My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out.  </li>
            <li> Overall is good, only the sound is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> My old Phillips Sonicare Elite toothbrush lasted several years and I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I originally planned to purchase just a replacement handle, but saw this complete package with a travel pouch, brush head and charger for under $50 and then discovered a $10 discount code and that sealed the deal.  </li>
            <li> I have owned other Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in sum, this has good battery technology, but you will have to be careful not to leave it in the charger and make sure you run it down.  </li>
            <li> I hope this one can hold up as well and so far my teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how clean my teeth felt afterward.  </li>
            <li> But it cleans as good as the more expensive toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> To me this brush is just as good as the Elite line of the more expensive Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> A good solid toothbrush, my second one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush while it lasts but it gets only 3 stars because it DOESN&#x27;T last.</li>
            <li> The head itself is also a little smaller which helps it fit and turn more easily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a deep clean without breaking the bank, this is the brush for you!</li>
            <li> At first, you will feel an intense tickling sensation but you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is pretty much the entry unit into the Sonicare line of products.  </li>
            <li> I love how long the battery lasts on this product.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to higher cost Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Pretty much it is just a pouch with a zipper.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that not only did I buy the same one again</li>
            <li> This one does almost as good, but since I have a small mouth the longer head doesn&#x27;t quit get to all my teeth as well.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity was gone by the fourth time i brushed, and I love the way my teeth feel so much now, after brushing, that I brush much more frequently throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> Once you use this product, you can never go back to a regular toothbrush because it does a terrific job cleaning your teeth and is most effective.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a very long time using it in this manner, so you don&#x27;t have to find a plugin often, the unit is lightweight, and the results are truly worthwhile for your dental health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing out the brush and handle assembly after each use isn&#x27;t all that burdensome, either: it takes less than 30 seconds, and is easily done as you give the unit the same kind of rinse you would give any toothbrush after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for a simple, easy to use rechargeable electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Even with the above precaution of dismantling the brush after each use, one must actually clean both open parts with a q-tip about once a week to be sure there isn&#x27;t a speck of mold lurking in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> After nearly a decade I finally found a suitable replacement.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is a simple version and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> However, for me, it made my teeth became so SUPER sensitive after just 5 days of use that just breathing through my mouth</li>
            <li> They screw on to the brush and have a large opening inside the head that collects moisture.</li>
            <li> Be smart, be timely, and be clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a smart toothbrush.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am certain this brush does everything is should.</li>
            <li> I have an older sonicare that I like very much.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the product&#x27;s appearance sucks!</li>
            <li> What sets the &#x27;basic&#x27; model apart from my &#x27;deluxe&#x27; Sonicare is seemingly minor, but is worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing twice as fast and easy as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> breath is super fresh, and lots of people have been commenting on how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last a long time, I have my charger put away most the time and pull it out very rarely.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good deal when I placed my order, but the toothbrush stopped working properly last month (only 4 months after purchase) and now a fully charged battery only gets me two brushing sessions at full power before the power drains.</li>
            <li> I must have missed reading the fine print since the last time I bought this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had a lot of different &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34; before and they&#x27;ve all been fine.</li>
            <li> so well you&#x27;ll more than likely save on going to the dentist as less cavities are sure to be a side effect of using this combined with perhaps an air/water pik.</li>
            <li> For example, I use a Sonicare HealthyWhite 3 Mode toothbrush, which has a setting for Clean, Sensitive, and Clean and White.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Philips/Sonicare has discontinued the original style head and gone with a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; head that fits both the first and second generation toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I had the standard battery operated model and it was fine</li>
            <li> The first one I owned was purchased around 8 years ago and had the older NiCad battery technology which eventually died.  </li>
            <li> but it was exactly what I needed, a replacement handle &amp; brush for my older Sonicare  toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Would very highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> now i wont stop using this nice tooth brush, i think heads replacement are a little pricey but</li>
            <li> The little case is really handy because I travel a lot.  </li>
            <li> This is the easiest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, comes apart to make a nice compact little package for traveling.  </li>
            <li> This one has a nice little carrying case.  </li>
            <li> This one has a nice little carrying case.  </li>
            <li> After the first time he used it, he told me he never brushed his tooth so clean.</li>
            <li> it seems a little more powerful than my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it seems a little more powerful than my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much like a snowmobile that isn&#x27;t particularly designed to work in cold weather: it drives perfectly for 10 miles before the water in the radiator just freezes no matter what you do.</li>
            <li> With its simple setup and easy-to-understand instructions, this electric toothbrush does a great job without being too harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li> The vibration of this toothbrush had swept away all the stuff my traditional toothbrush was missing, and it was great for my gums too.  </li>
            <li> Huge difference between this and using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I smooth toothpaste over teeth before starting it up and found that works well.</li>
            <li> I used it until the light started blinking (telling me that the charge was low).</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> My teeth were so much whiter after just one week.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This one really turned me around on electric toothbrushes though.</li>
            <li> My teeth appear much cleaner as well.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this - it is a turbo-toothbrush</li>
            <li> Our aunt received this as a gift and likes it much.  </li>
            <li> Saves me time and so much energy.</li>
            <li> The brush is very vigorous and feel like you got a dentist-style cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the charging rate is fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit for the size of the brush head.</li>
            <li> But this unit does take a week or so to really get used to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenience for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> They really need to add an o-ring or something to keep this watertight.</li>
            <li> It just runs 2 minutes straight thru.</li>
            <li> I chose the Essence because I had extra brush heads that fit</li>
            <li> The brush works very well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> (I get ready in the morning on another floor because that is where my closet is--</li>
            <li> This and a water pic have REALLY improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the Essence.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two beeps that start the timer are almost inaudible unless you&#x27;re really listening closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out of guilt, I went online hours before i was scheduled to see my dentist, and hastily purchased the best-rated toothbrush with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li> whole process takes like 12 seconds and costs about a tenth of a calorie, so don&#x27;t even worry about</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is really worked out</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and will be using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare toothbrush about 5 years ago but got away from it because the replacement heads cost too much.</li>
            <li> We really like this.</li>
            <li> He really likes to use the Sonic toothbrush and so do I.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge, and cleans the teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vigorous and gentle.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get all the bells and whistles this time but don&#x27;t really miss them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I really find my self</li>
            <li> I thought that was unusual, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I keep it on the charger each day so it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I like this so much</li>
            <li> Timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 performs very well.  </li>
            <li> And yes they do take some getting used to, and don&#x27;t ever start the brush unless it is IN your mouth, unless you enjoy cleaning your bathroom, especially the mirror!</li>
            <li> After brushing, my teeth feel much cleaner than they did with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now it can&#x27;t be fully charged -- normally it only takes ~4hrs to fully charge, but this time it&#x27;s already charged for 24 hours and the light is still flashing...</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> No annoying thirty-second blips or multiple settings to fiddle around with.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After one week, my gums are healthier, my mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The vibration takes some time to get used to, but my teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> just go it, really like it</li>
            <li> and I guess it&#x27;s doing what my dentist wants it to do...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s absolutely it.</li>
            <li> I really like having this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> purchased at Amazon and the price was affordable, shipping fast.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t understand why I spent so many years without one.</li>
            <li> vibrates a lot - gives very tingly feeling to the teeth - it also had very unpleansat touch to the teeth when stem hits you.</li>
            <li> This is important because if you push a button twice to cycle it and turn it off while it is in the middle of changing modes, instead of it turning off, it turns on, and your spit and toothpaste go flying, so</li>
            <li> It also needs to be charged very infrequently.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this it goes to fast in your mouth</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is accomplished using a magnetic actuator.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I received it in a very timely manner through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner after using manuals for years..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it ..</li>
            <li> You can really feel and see the results.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> as expected , quality with a refreshing vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Charged the toothbrush and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicares for years, probably bought 6-7 of them and my whole family has them.  </li>
            <li> I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have that, but I didn&#x27;t really pay that much attention to it anyway.</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have that, but I didn&#x27;t really pay that much attention to it anyway.</li>
            <li> As far as the brush goes, it is okay for a basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , it is a really nice change over the traditional simple brush.</li>
            <li> If you want more time but want to set it to a different fixed value, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I will be good for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and hope this one lasts as long as the last one which was around 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> hope this one last as many years as old one did,,</li>
            <li> This new offering from Philips has reversed that for me, the brush is slimmer and feels better in the hand that other recent models and I am pleased with how clean and well brushed my teeth and gums feel after use.  </li>
            <li> Why the heck Sonicare didn&#x27;t include that simple and very useful aspect to this is beyond me.</li>
            <li> and this type is not very expensive.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to keep track how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the head and head action, but messy mildrew clean up.</li>
            <li> It is actually very pleasant and far less abrasive than other cheaper vibrating toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li> The only practical and discernible difference between this one and my original Sonicare is that it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is better then the other brand .</li>
            <li> suggest you look at other more durable brands..</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than any other electric toothbrush that I have ever used</li>
            <li> However, this one does not have the 60 second interval timer that my original one had.</li>
            <li> Other models have slightly more features.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the manual and other electric brushes,</li>
            <li> This is my second one after a few years, pretty good deal for this brush</li>
            <li> It has fewer bells and whistles than some of the other models, but, as a result, it seems to be more reliable and durable.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> original finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth and is not too big to fit in the small areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li> But once you are past the initial uncomfortableness, it works great.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic buzz was pretty odd at first, but it gets our teeth smooth like when you get them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Totally makes my teeth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It gets teeth really clean in a way that only a dental visit can surpass.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel clean using a regular toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li> It works fine but vibrates allot &amp; feels a bit strange.</li>
            <li> Third, after brushing use the massage setting along with mouthwash to finish off with a clean mouth.</li>
            <li> With these you occasionally had to unscrew the head and clean them out (with an old-style toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tend to brush my teeth for over 2 minutes, which helps me get that &#x27;extra&#x27; clean feel.  </li>
            <li> It totally leaves your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> The whole toothbrush isn&#x27;t as compact as my older model either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about 5-6 months and my teeth don&#x27;t look or feel as clean as others i have used.</li>
            <li> Wish the charge would last a  little longer, but overall really nice - love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> It has a very obnoxious high pitched buzzing noise as well.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a present and the person using it was able to remove large blemishes on their teeth after several uses.</li>
            <li> easy start feature made it simple for even my 7 year old to get used to using this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up</li>
            <li> &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model has a small &#x27;beep&#x27;</li>
            <li> A full charge can last all week.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and have always been optimistic about them, but when I started using my Sonicare, it made a world of a difference and completely changed my opinion.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is nice, but the bristles seem a little soft.  </li>
            <li> Before trying it I had reservations about the extreme tickling I experienced in a brief trial several years ago.  </li>
            <li> It brings my lazyness to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a quad-pacer model which lasted more than five years.</li>
            <li> I now have no issues when I see my dentist, whereas before my teeth typically needed more work.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, about the size of a Wii remote.</li>
            <li> If you do, then you don&#x27;t have to pay more than $50 (or $100 for some) for a product that essentially does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Now she won&#x27;t use her old toothbrush (I&#x27;m cheap, I only use the Sonicare in the evening and a manual one in the morning.)</li>
            <li> No serious problems.</li>
            <li> Although this is an older model toothbrush it works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Will know more with my next check-up and cleaning scheduled for next month.</li>
            <li> My last dentist visit was significantly better than when I was using a regular brush</li>
            <li> The charger works well but takes up a decent amount of counter space.</li>
            <li> No serious dental problems.</li>
            <li> Particularly like the carrying case as we travel quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my husbands older one that broke</li>
            <li> 30 seconds on the top teeth on the outside, 30 second on the top teeth on the inside of your mouth, 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the outside, and finally 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the inside of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrush is nice to hold, not loud and holds a charge for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> After using a regular ol toothbrush for many years, I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Works well and quieter than my older model.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find the same part number so it would fit my old charger</li>
            <li> , I usally dont write exaggurated reviews, but after being to the dentist and discussing my issues, mainly being lack of ability to reach/</li>
            <li> Rather than get a newer model for lots more money, I looked around for an older one that costs less.</li>
            <li> The photograph next to this review is INCORRECT; my Model 5610 is much more slender and does not have the big dome shape below the brush head as is shown in this photo.  </li>
            <li> , I believe this is the older model</li>
            <li> If price is your main consideration over all else, this is the model...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a two minute timer like my older model.  </li>
            <li> Ive got very sensitive gums and this toothbrush really helps with not bleeding in addition to whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not pleased with the cost of the brushes, but it obviously is a complicated unit; it would be nice if Sonicare came up with a replacement brush that more easily removes from the shaft, so that there is less to replace (the replacement brushes from Sonicare include the entire shaft with screw on assembly; there are aftermarket brushes that pull apart from the shaft, apparently with great difficulty).  </li>
            <li> Like many products today this &amp;#34;newer and improved&amp;#34; electric toothbrush is less sturdy and less easy to use than the original version or even the last version before this.</li>
            <li> brush is pretty quiet and does a fantastic job of getting my pearly whites just that - white.</li>
            <li> my dentist wise surmised that I want it to keep in its current condition as long as possible and he recommended Sonicare as stacking the deck in my favor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product since it cleans</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> really nice product!but much more expensive than the one sold in Walmart!</li>
            <li> What I do like better about this model is that the movement is a little stronger than my older model, the brush seems to move faster and have a little more power.  </li>
            <li> My first mechanical toothbrush, so I have no other device to compare it to besides the manual brush.</li>
            <li> Other models cost more, but don&#x27;t declare a higher performance, just a different style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough compactness ensures a good grip and the simplicity of its \\&quot;control interface\\</li>
            <li> I like it much better than my very old previous Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> but I just clean and dry it once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed mold developing.</li>
            <li> I have never been happy with this product and now find its useless.</li>
            <li> now I take it apart and clean it and dry it every day.</li>
            <li> So, if you need a reminder on when it&#x27;s time to switch sections of the mouth (and it&#x27;s worth $30+ to you), then you can upgrade to the next model.</li>
            <li> Though there are more sophisticated models on the market, I&#x27;m not sure why the average person would need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it seems as powerful as my former model.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush just sits atop the charger, and charges without having to be positioned just so, or making sure Part A is nestled firmly against Part B.</li>
            <li> This is where a lot of normal brushing misses.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bothered, as I&#x27;m sure it would be a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Love it but the brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> initial week of using electric toothbrushes did need some getting used to since your entire mouth is vibrating rapidly, but after that week I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> That said, I was less than thrilled to find that the various parts of the toothbrush are NOT watertight, and will admit water, toothpaste, and saliva.</li>
            <li> run this over your teeth slowly, now scrubbing, and BAM, sparkling clean and clean feeling teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price, only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have the automatic 30 second notification like my other one.</li>
            <li> right now, the charge only lasts for about 20 seconds on 3 hour charge.</li>
            <li> Luckily, since I have been using that one for years, I sort of know the pattern and how long to park on each tooth.</li>
            <li> It is that exact same toothbrush I had for much less than I originally paid for my first one.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a practical toothbrush for more than an individual simply because there&#x27;s no place to store an extra toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and after just a few days, previous problems with bleeding gums are gone completely!</li>
            <li> i like it and it takes a little time to be used with the sound and vibration, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> The first time using the toothbrush it slowly works its way up in intensity for the first 12 uses before going to full power.</li>
            <li> On time and new as stated.</li>
            <li> I have been using one for over 10 years and can say that it does live up to its reputation.  </li>
            <li> and I will have to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to replace its battery, just figured we&#x27;d go for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one is working well and we look forward to years of service from it.</li>
            <li> I chose to replace my Sonicare Essence 5600 with a new one.  </li>
            <li> Since I alredya had soem new heads</li>
            <li> and I am getting used to the new brush.</li>
            <li> I mentioned I just got a brand new Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but that turned out to be no problem because they send a new charger for it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to school to become a Dental Hygienist and always looking for new toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I did this with the new brush after a 24 hour change.</li>
            <li> I&lt;br /&gt;immediately started shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this and replacing the heads</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner now when i go in to the dentist, and my gums are also doing better since I know longer brush to hard.</li>
            <li> The other 3 are the FlexCare, Healthy White, and the older Elite models.  </li>
            <li> The older attachments I had for the old Sonicare are compatible with this new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference, would never go back to my regular toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product and its predecessor so much that I&#x27;ve purchased others and given them as gifts, and my dental hygienist remarked that I had less plaque and tartar buildup on my last visit to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this little toothbrush!</li>
            <li> the noise is VERY loud</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> On/off button very sensitIve.</li>
            <li> I purchased it right after moving out my old apartment because I only need just ONE toothbrush rather than two!</li>
            <li> I had extra brush heads for my old Sonicare, so it was important to me to purchase a new unit that would use the same brush head.</li>
            <li> The only difference with this model is it does not have timed sequences like my original model - not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first sonicare that stopped holding a charge after several years.  </li>
            <li> I had the first brush forever and when it finally bit the dust I didn&#x27;t think twice, I ordered and another.</li>
            <li> Usually when I brush my teeth manually, I will finish soon, but electric one can make sure brushing 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> When the first one finally stopped working (it worked for years)</li>
            <li> The basic model does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> For the first week of two it does feel like you just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;After using this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model</li>
            <li> It is not expensive, especially if it can help save your teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a particularly lazy or disorganized person, but this toothbrush didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> First, the handle itself is much larger in diameter.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in upgrading.</li>
            <li> WoW!</li>
            <li> I usually rely more on the appearance of the brush head than the color indicator that supposedly show when a brush head should be replaced.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> will do an update in the future, as I often do for those interested in longevity.</li>
            <li> Unlike the first generation which used NiCad batteries, this uses NiMH batteries which was used in the second generation.  </li>
            <li> Many people cannot get past that</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE AFTER 8 YEARS FINALLY BIT THE DUST.  </li>
            <li> There have been several generations of Sonicare, and up until the most recent generation, they had two critical flaws in my book, and this model shares those flaws:  </li>
            <li> Keep your mouth closed, and brush bent over the sink!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> People complain about the inside getting gross, but that&#x27;s because they themselves are gross and don&#x27;t clean it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth operation, seems to last a long time on a charge, and my teeth are quite noticeably cleaner than from using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A lot less clunky than the cheap battery powered electric I was using.</li>
            <li> Retail prices are astronomical, Amazons are half the cost and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> You can actually hear and feel the difference at the different settings, e.g., the sensitive setting doesn&#x27;t vibrate as vigorously as the clean setting.  </li>
            <li> We bought our 3rd Sonicare after the first worked itself to death (old A series lasted for 3 or 4 years) and</li>
            <li> think the design of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes are actually flawed and this older head design is far superior.</li>
            <li> This photo does look like the HX6711 model I bought, which is heavy, bulky, noisy and has an uncomfortably strong vibration during use.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is very loud and sensitive and takes a while to get used too</li>
            <li> The only other time my mouth has felt this clean is by visiting the dentist them self!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the same accumulations of plaque in certain areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all just a matter of what features are important to you.l had little pauses that you could hear after each 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Works as intended, you will need to clean it as the part under the screw down replacement head gets damp (that&#x27;s what mold likes to grow in, damp places).</li>
            <li> you have to change the heads, then it will you 40 to 50 dollars for six new brush heads and its hard to clean!</li>
            <li> Say good-bye to gingivitis and bad breath and say hello to happiness and success.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth are extra sensitive, but I found the vibration to be too much to handle.</li>
            <li> Yes there&#x27;s a bit leaking but every time when I change the brush head I would clean and dry it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old one, which lasted almost five years.</li>
            <li> toothbrush came completely uncharged.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than if I use a regular brush</li>
            <li> She was in complete agreement.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I found this toothbrush and it works just as well as my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works just like my old sonicare elite brush.</li>
            <li> But people with sensitive teeth may want to find another model.</li>
            <li> It vibrates really loud.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem with old spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> It seems to hold charge longer than my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and has a internal timer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about the Philips Sonicare toothbrush until my last visit with my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are so much clearer than traditional brushing.  </li>
            <li> But, I think most users would know that piece of common sense</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li> So, now I am ordering another one for my 20 year old.</li>
            <li> It does collect there just like in the old model</li>
            <li> I replaced an old one that I had for years.</li>
            <li> The head vibrates too loudly.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning, but I bet he will like the effects as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with 2 brushes in case one gets too soft.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations and was considerably cheaper online.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I only read the reviews on the whole unit, and didn&#x27;t think to read those about the replacement toothbrush heads themselves.  </li>
            <li> So far, no problems.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 year old son.</li>
            <li> The charger is also bigger because the HealthyWhite came with a separate travel charger that was really compact.  </li>
            <li> Broke my old one.</li>
            <li> Feels much cleaner and the battery actually stays charged!</li>
            <li> Those are so far below this, they are incomparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sonic action of the brush forces water between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Your mouth is left feeling much cleaner and the automatic timer helps to ensure you brush for the recommended two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for nearly a month</li>
            <li> After 6 years, my old one just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Really like the smaller head.</li>
            <li> The brush head is soft and seems to be doing its job</li>
            <li> Dentist visits have dropped considerably since we have been using this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> All told, it takes about 5-6 minutes to complete the process.</li>
            <li> MY OLD SONICARE DIED AFTER 13 YEARS...</li>
            <li> You have to get used to the &amp;#34;sonic feel&amp;#34; as it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a standard toothbrush going over your teeth.  </li>
            <li> At least 10X better, although it looks kinda MacGyver&#x27;ed.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 11 year old daughter and</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews saying it worked for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Also, the rechargeable battery appears to be completely sealed off from the charger (no metal contacts to corrode).</li>
            <li> This seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> It was like my old one</li>
            <li> This was a replacement unit for a 5 year old one</li>
            <li> I bough this to replace my old Sonicare elite, which I have had for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> My whole family have switched from traditional toothbrush to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Before I used an electric toothbrush, I was having real problems with plaque, despite having regular dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li> I like the old version, like this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Does it get my teeth whiter than the old model?  </li>
            <li> Does it get my teeth whiter than the old model?  </li>
            <li> There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version.  </li>
            <li> the essence model is basic but that&#x27;s all one really needs.</li>
            <li> okay, one of the key features I like about Sonicare brushes is missing.</li>
            <li> The action is just right, not too hard, but effective enough to get the grit and film off my teeth left by my numerous medications.</li>
            <li> I take the charger for anything over a week, but other than that it seems to last just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, sorry to digress, but I have UNIVERSALLY found that the best model with in each generation is the most simple one without all the feature-laden whistles and bells, ridiculous UV cleaners, etc., which just drive up your cost both initial and in consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that stopped being able to hold a charge long enough for a single brushing.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare brushes were old and it was cheaper to buy this entire kit, than to find replacement brush heads for the older model.</li>
            <li> It is small and easy to maneuver in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I could have purchased just the charger, but for just a little extra money I was able to buy an entire new electric toothbrush unit.  </li>
            <li> Doing this will effectively &#x27;pattern&#x27; the battery to where it will hold less and less of a charge.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an much older American made Sonicare that gave up the ghost from shear old age.</li>
            <li> : Why get an expensive gadget, when I can do the exact same thing on my own, for a fraction of the price?</li>
            <li> Second one of these I&#x27;ve owned (the first one lasted a long time and is still holding a charge but my dentist suggested I get a new one)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully the new unit lasts as long as our first one did; if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be back here to update the review accordingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I was floored that this new Sonicare is not only heavier and bulkier than my 6 year old Oral B electric toothbrush but also considerably louder.</li>
            <li> I diligently kept using it, three times a day, and after a few days, I got used to the vibrating sensation, and started to appreciate how clean my teeth felt after brushing.</li>
            <li> no one else will make the same mistake i did buy buying this particular model</li>
            <li> I had the first generation Sonicare, which finally died on me after nearly ten years.</li>
            <li> It really gyrates pretty heavily and you will want to turn it off before taking it out of your mouth unless you want specks of toothpaste all over you and your bathroom counter/mirror.</li>
            <li> kidding aside, the bristle action is firm but not painful.</li>
            <li> I replaced the same toothbrush, as the older one no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li> particular unit, the HX5610/01, is actually my 2nd Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The 3rd replacement we recently bought is a 2 handle one that we charged for first 24 hours and then used - without recharging - over 60, 2 min.</li>
            <li> We then switched out the first handle for a totally charged second handle that is then used for another 60-ish uses.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately in the past I have equated more technical features and higher price with better.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace an older one which was starting to have a shorter battery life after five years of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister since I have the same exact one which I purchased at BedBathBeyond for a similar price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the holder is to large for the hand and it becomes hard to use the handle should be made smaller to fit in your hand</li>
            <li> I tried screwing it on different way and making sure it is tight etc but still the same problem.</li>
            <li> It vibrates at such a high frequency.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the older one would hold a charge because it was compact enough to take the whole thing along when we traveled</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the older one would hold a charge because it was compact enough to take the whole thing along when we traveled</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did.  </li>
            <li> HAPPENS OVERNITE AND IS NOT EASY TO CLEAN IT OFF.</li>
            <li> I clean mine in a jar of alcohol weekly and keep it open as much as possible to dry out.</li>
            <li> It did take a longer than expected time to charge the first time but have not had problems with charging since.</li>
            <li> , it has a cheap feeling base, I am wondering how long it will last, it feels cheap, which is a shame because the body of the brush (the fat part you hold) feels much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Coming from a normal toothbrush the feeling is much different and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ever go back to using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like that the brush assembly is more expensive to replace and more difficult to disassemble and clean.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like that the brush assembly is more expensive to replace and more difficult to disassemble and clean.</li>
            <li> Its about the only model I had yet to purchase and try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped on a new head and gave it a try and after having for two years it was still powerful and did not bog down with any amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> After nine years my last one died and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have used these for the last 2 years and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> Finally bought a new one</li>
            <li> This new one has updated Lithium battery technology, which should last longer without the NiCad memory effect (I hope).  </li>
            <li> The manual says to take the brush head off every week to air dry it, but who really has the time to do that?</li>
            <li> The healthy white model lasted at least three years.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that replacement heads are rather pricey, but that seems to be the case with most electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s old toothbrush completely lost its charge after 10 years and he insisted on getting this similar model to replace it.  </li>
            <li> The only difference was the blue coloring on this one, but it&#x27;s a toothbrush who really cares about the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care about all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any need for the additional features offered on the more expensive</li>
            <li> but I had bought so many things that I was forced to send it back because I didn&#x27;t have a use for it.  </li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare I have purchased in type last 10 years all have lasted twice a day brushing for at least 4 years looking at the other models they pretty much are the same with some fancy bells and whistles for more money.</li>
            <li> Just be aware, the neck is very delicate, so be careful when traveling :)</li>
            <li> Purchase of the original set is very cost-effective, but the cost of additional brush heads when you need to change them (you DO change your toothbrush regularly, yes?!) is pretty darned expensive.  </li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is lightweight, easily charged, portable and the smaller brush is easier to use in small spaces.  </li>
            <li> The price was just right, this tooth brush is an investment, less trips to the dentist office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The original first generation toothbrushes used an open sort of toothbrush head with a plate behind the brush.  </li>
            <li> Even with daily cleaning there is black slimy bold inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again particularly if it was more expensive than the sale price ($25).</li>
            <li> I replaced an older, more expensive model that had lasted for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long this one last but the guarantee for the 2 1/2 yrs certainly helps.</li>
            <li> Only downer is I take it on the road everywhere and they no longer provide the hard plastic travel case, and the one from my old unit doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> very useful and can be used in long time after charged, it&#x27;s convenient to a little bag when travlling.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps the charging process in general is finicky.</li>
            <li> The ability to slowly adjust your teeth and gums to the sonic pulses is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> One model old but still terrific.</li>
            <li> my dentist reccomends using an electric toothbrush with a &#x27;extra soft&#x27; head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several Sonicare and this is by far the model to NOT get.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same sonicare toothbrush since I was probably about 9 years old</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because the old one finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> My old one finally pooped out.</li>
            <li> Also toothpaste seems to spray everywhere if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an 3 year old oral B for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li> Not fun first thing in the morning pre-coffee.</li>
            <li> I wish it had the 30 second timer that my old one had, letting you know to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even consider taking my old one, it is almost as big as my curling iron!</li>
            <li> One of the things i noticed after using this brush was that my breath actually improved even though i wasn&#x27;t brushing anymore frequently.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my old Philips electric toothbrush where the battery had finally died</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth actually feel like they do after a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Old sonicare finally dies afte about 12 years so time for replacement.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending this for ever, finally got one and WOW</li>
            <li> This is my second as the old motor wore out after two+ years.  </li>
            <li> second (E series) pooped out before it was 2 years old.</li>
            <li> My two complains are: the charger barely holds the brush in place</li>
            <li> I especially like the way the drive motor is sealed off, in fact, completely isolated, from the brush.</li>
            <li> Several months later I had my teeth cleaned and the hygenist asked me what I had been doing different because I had too much plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m harsh with stars, I rarely give 5s, so don&#x27;t fret).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you like moldy water collecting inside your brush which I am sure leaks into the bristles when you are using it...if you are confused by this, google it and you will be grossed out.</li>
            <li> Also the charging stand is flimsy compared with the older one (which, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t work with the newer one), and despite my fastidious attempts to clean the bottom of the toothbrush each time before replacing it in the charger, enough toothpaste residue persists which acts like glue so that when you pick up the toothbrush to use it again the whole charge apparatus comes up with it,  stuck to the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model less than 2 months ago and with twice daily use and regular charging, the battery no longer lasts a full two minutes without needing another charge.</li>
            <li> it also is relatively inexpensive if you are new to Sonicare, but your next one will want to be the Li-Ion versions.  </li>
            <li> They really help my dental health because I have a dry mouth which required extra care.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and we love that the charging base isn&#x27;t overcomplicated for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this toothbrush is really designed for a single person or for an individual who travels.</li>
            <li> The only quibble is battery life (it&#x27;s a NiCad device with the usual issues with battery memory) and you need to keep the device clean.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products, I feel like this price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> how much battery life is left--I do appreciate the other Sonicare brushes with the battery life LED levels.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep it clean though.  </li>
            <li> I delayed as long as possible in buying a new one because the last new one, a different model from Costco, didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Towards the end it seemed to slow down and needed cleaning more frequently as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulated inside.  </li>
            <li> Because batteries and wirings have improved in the last decade, with this new unit I plan to fully charge it for 48 hours and then use it daily but let it set out of the charger for four or five days, in hopes that will help the battery last longer.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Sonicare just remember one thing, the replacement heads are not cheap compared to the actual cost of the whole Sonicare brush itself.</li>
            <li> So, when the battery died recently (nearly 20 years later), I definitely wanted to purchase another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is the 20 to 30 second &amp;#34;advance&amp;#34; for each quadrant like the old model.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died after years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Actually the heads last considerably longer than what is recommended by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely too early to make a solid judgement.</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel so clean when I know that there&#x27;s a thick layer of mold growing in my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The seller did not state that this Soniccare product was an old version (maybe the 1st generation) which requires much more expensive replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that the replacement heads are kind of expensive and it seems like I will be replacing the heads every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> I have had many different electric toothbrushes and this is the worse one i have ever had.  </li>
            <li> I will highly recommended, specially if you have kids, because it really will forced them to keep the toothbrush in their mouth until it turns off!!!</li>
            <li> I have also used every major generation of Sonicare toothbrush and several models within each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, because it is less complicated, this model is very affordable compared to some of the other models, but it leaves your teeth just as smooth and clean as the others.  </li>
            <li> She said that it did not really give her the clean that she had with the old Sonicares that she&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great for me, the price is right and helps out my terrible tooth situation.</li>
            <li> The seam where you  open in the middle gets a big gunky, a quick wipe is needed after a few washes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t charge totally up and then discharge totally DOWN, the batteries will become less able to hold a long charge and you will be replacing a lot sooner than you would otherwise.</li>
            <li> For those not wanting to spend a lot on a brush this version offers long batter life, two minute timer, charging indicator, and travel pouch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to admit, it had been 5 years since my last dental visit a few years back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I still use the traditional toothbrush when I travel just to save weight in my bag and its noticeable when you switch between electric and hand toothbrushes, I subconsciously feel that my teeth are not as clean when I use the traditional toothbrush after using the Sonicare for the past</li>
            <li> I scrape between my teeth with one of those metal tooth picks in a couple of my problem areas, then set the sonicare in that spot (quite lightly, mainly using the sonic action) for a few cycles.</li>
            <li> really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still prefer this to the other $80 sonicare models because of the price mainly.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 6 years, second one 4 years, third one only lasted 3 years so the quality has gone down.</li>
            <li> It does get a little gunky inside, so you have to clean it out regularly, other than that</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare makes less noise and is much lighter compared to spin brush.</li>
            <li> Phillips designed it so that you have to replace about half of the whole unit, and they charge you accordingly.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH STRONGER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE</li>
            <li> and if you are conscious of water getting in and dry off the brush head after every use, you will never encounter this problem.</li>
            <li> This allows your gums to slowly get adjusted to the action of the brush head over the first twelve uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the basic model of a Sonicare, but you really don’t need all of the bells and whistles that come with other models!</li>
            <li> my teeth had when first using this toothbrush, but THE GROSS BLACK MOLD that forms EVERY TIME underneath the brush head just is NOT ACCEPTABLE!</li>
            <li> The major advantage this model has over all the other models I&#x27;ve owned is that it has stronger action in the brush head.  </li>
            <li> my old one had, I like knowing that I brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> This is the bare bones, no frills version of the Sonicare, without any of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no travel charger, no UV cleaning feature, no extra heads or color-code rings, and no audible signal or vibration for the 30 second change-</li>
            <li> , it is very easy for it to fall down, so I have to put it on a flat surface to charge; also, the brush was very hard on my gums for first few days, but now I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic.  </li>
            <li> This brush goes above and beyond cleaning your teeth, you can feel it really get into the tight spots as you glide over your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old, and never had one single cavity!</li>
            <li> My FlexCare and Healthy White brushes attach to the body right at the base of the neck so fluid doesn&#x27;t collect on the inside.  </li>
            <li> From reading all the other reviews it was clear that the inside would have to be cleaned regularly.</li>
            <li> My older model had little pauses that you could hear after each 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I have a large mouth with horse teeth, and it just feels different from the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve utilized in the past.</li>
            <li> Lastly, if you have sensitive teeth, you can buy sensitive replacement head assembly thingies (whatever they&#x27;re called), which I&#x27;ve been using for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> I left this on my wish list for several weeks, and during that time, the price came down considerably.</li>
            <li> but once the battery died and i had to recharge it, it pretty much stopped working and is useless.</li>
            <li> It was pretty gross to say the least.</li>
            <li> found that after a few weeks on the newer designed Sonicare toothbrushes they tend to lose \\&quot;torque\\&quot; or \\&quot;power\\&quot; because the brush strokes are so high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do not need an expensive electric toothbrush to clean your teeth!  </li>
            <li> The mold gets unmanageable and hard to remove also pretty soon</li>
            <li> I had to search pretty hard to find this</li>
            <li> A simple rinse and dry after use and then back in the charger.</li>
            <li> For $70 you&#x27;re getting a single function electric toothbrush, simply meaning that there&#x27;s only an on/off button and no variable speed brushing or vibrating.</li>
            <li> One small feature to sacrifice for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> Spend the extra coin and get any of the models, even the 2 Series, just as long as it doesn&#x27;t have the screw on heads.</li>
            <li> However the battery does not hold a charge long enough to brush teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The battery on that one doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to (about a week.)</li>
            <li> Long lasting lithium battery goes for years.  </li>
            <li> Before I neglected brushing manually because it took so long to properly do the job and took effort, using this product...</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to assess how well it cleans teeth.</li>
            <li> If you desire to relax your arms and use it for long time, I advise you to purchase it without doubt as well as buy several substitutable brush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Oral-B&#x27;s may not last that long</li>
            <li> The first charge seemed rather slow, over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> My old one lasted close to 10 years before breaking down.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it broke down any time soon.</li>
            <li> $70 marked down to $40 with a $10 claimable coupon.</li>
            <li> I little loud but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> prefer the more expensive model, but for double the price, I&#x27;m not sure its &#x27;must-have&#x27; feature I find so valuable in the more expensive model should sway you to the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> so my silly yearning for scientific toothbrushing (I kid, but not really!) is spoiled because I have to guess when to move from the top outside surfaces to the inside.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush for children instead of the inefficient, childlike (toy) toothbrushes that never last very long.</li>
            <li> I tried opening it to dry it out each time I used it, but the mold just kept coming back.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that it gets water inside the unit and has to be left apart to dry.</li>
            <li> I have actually just gotten back from a two week vacation in Europe and brought the toothbrush with me (without the charging stand) to save on minimal weight and space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is really helpful, as I can&#x27;t say that I would usually brush that long using my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if the head isn&#x27;t screwed on tightly enough, there&#x27;s no real indication to tell you.</li>
            <li> (this one will last a month on a single charge and I brush twice</li>
            <li> It seems like at least half of the reviews here are from folks in the exact same boat we were in.... owned one of these Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush sets for the last 10 year, and it finally stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this tooth brush for 3 days, but have already noticed a slight decrease in the sensitivity I was experiencing (even with the regular brush that comes standard in the package).</li>
            <li> Water seems to get between the charger station and the toothbrush often resulting in icky green mold that I have to clean off about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose it is arbitrary really, but I like the little pause in buzzing to know when to move to another quadrant!</li>
            <li> The major problem that I see with this brush is that water and toothpaste trickle down the handle and get inside the housing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t spectacular either.</li>
            <li> Not surprised though being that the battery is not a lithium battery.</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li> I should have bought one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had it so long</li>
            <li> i dont know why it took me so long to buy one of these...</li>
            <li> but that, and periodic replacement of the head will keep this product usable for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it seems like my teeth should be cleaner, but often they still seem filmy even after a long brushing.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Had not used an electric before and took a while - long while - to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Product came in earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> You dont have to keep it on a charger long.</li>
            <li> I like the 2 minute feature--I&#x27;m going to get these for my kids, so that they know how long they are supposed to be brushing.</li>
            <li> It seems minor, and in the scheme of life, it is.</li>
            <li> But one minor problem.</li>
            <li> hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Unit was as expected, but only comes with one brushhead.</li>
            <li> It runs for two minutes and you get to know about how long to spend on each section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> HOLDS A CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember my gums have bled after brushing my teeth, even when brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li> (Why does 2 minutes seem so long when you&#x27;re in a hurry?)  </li>
            <li> so you knew how long you were spending on each part of your mouth (Quadpacer Technology).</li>
            <li> so you knew how long you were spending on each part of your mouth (Quadpacer Technology).</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time and can be used for LED flashlights after spent in this unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for traveling; for trips shorter than 2 weeks, you don&#x27;t even need the base, because the battery lasts about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I simply wash under the tap briefly with the brush down and wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> But how come the price down from $39.95 to $24.95 only in ten days.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but does a much better job than a regular tooth brush (especially on hard to reach back teeth).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s 4 times less expensive than the oral-b I was using, but does a much better job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is more difficult to clean because it doesn&#x27;t just pull out like my old one, and it&#x27;s possible to get fluids under this brush base</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to switch to electronic after being with a manual for so long, so this one feels a little powerful to me</li>
            <li> Further, it is just next to impossible to clean these second generation heads.  </li>
            <li> As someone with puffy and sensitive gums (despite religious brushing and flossing), decalcification, some serious sensitivity, and an average of 3-4 cavities per dentist trip - I was desperate for something better for my oral health (especially since recently being diagnosed with a heart valve problem).</li>
            <li> get this, just opt for the other sonicare brushes that have the different brush head style.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that mold can form inside the brush housing due to moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the Essence 5600 is not compact relative to other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> It worked for about 2 months and then it started doing the same thing the other two did from the get go.  </li>
            <li> left the other n</li>
            <li> Brushing with this thing is like standing on a subway platform as a train flies by; in other words a jarring experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is if the pastic part of the brush touches your other teeth it feels like a jackhammer in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Have used them for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have to unscrew it and rinse it out and let it air dry every time I use the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Without the seal, it will dry, and not get so funky.  </li>
            <li> This brush has what I consider a serious design flaw that creates a very unsanitary situation.</li>
            <li> After using the brush, I always wash it off an dry the surface thoroughly before retiring it to the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am missing is that the sonicare this replaced had a timer set for every 30 seconds where it would pause briefly reminding me to shift zones.  </li>
            <li> and then to de-gunk the crevices where water and saliva seep in and allow icky stuff to grow (an issue with my older Sonicare toothbrush as well)</li>
            <li> There are more expensive versions, but I think it is just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint I have with it is that the old model would pulse every 30 seconds which indicated that the brushing needed to move to another quadrant.</li>
            <li> Moisture gets in the heads, and shortly, there will be massive black and pink hairy things growing inside.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is handy, and we now only bring one base.</li>
            <li> The batteries are not replacable.&lt;br /&gt;Would never live without an electric toothbrush once I switched over from manual.  </li>
            <li> After using this brush for a few days it left a mess of old toothpaste on the charger and my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The more expensive model finally broke down after a few years, so I replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li> The Essence 5600 lasts up to two weeks on a single charge and also comes with a cloth carrying pouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret spending a single penny on this purchase/investment.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the handle is large and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Since I got it &amp;#62;2 years ago I have not had a single cavity or dental issue.</li>
            <li> We will never go back to conventional toothbrushes...</li>
            <li> but not worth the regular price on it</li>
            <li> The second I sat down the hygienist knew I switched brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric toothbrushes, and this one beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li> I think it cuts down on the overall time I spend doing dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This is 2nd one for me, other 1 lasted over 5 years!</li>
            <li> Leave the brush head off and let it dry.... VIOLA!</li>
            <li> Phillips is a manufacturer that is slightly less likely than others to send defective or shaoddy products to the market.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds odd, but for someone who is homeless (such as myself), this is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that if your teeth accidentally touch the back of the brush while it is on, it makes an uncomfortable and ear-rattling buzz.</li>
            <li> At first I had to learn to use it, i kept turning it wrong, trying to use it as a regular brush.</li>
            <li> The battery was noticeably weaker after less than a yr of daily use.  </li>
            <li> i then searched on here and this seller had the same brand for much less i have been using it</li>
            <li> Sorry about that./&gt;I prefer the more expensive model, but for double the price, I&#x27;m not sure its &#x27;must-have&#x27; feature I find so valuable in the more expensive model should sway you to the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I flossed even less than I had with my traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the same as the previous unit we owned for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from using an Oral B electric toothbrush that had slots for storing more than one brush-head and was immediately disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a similar feature here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it to replace a previous model I had used for years that finally refused to recharge.  </li>
            <li> I was most disappointed that there was only one brush and no stand for it.  </li>
            <li> Held a charge for less than a week, didn&#x27;t beep at me when the charge was getting low.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that the brush heads wear quickly and they are expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> This replaced a more expensive model but very few differences are noted.  </li>
            <li> as do other models, so you have to either count or guess how long to brush each quadrant.</li>
            <li> It comes in an easy to open box, with a travel case and base charger, and is your basic one-man (or woman) tooth cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little peeved that they&#x27;ve stripped the 30 second interval timer from the cheaper models (they do throw in a travel bag...which I tossed...).  </li>
            <li> machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An improvement would be if they could include those little tongue-cleaning nodule-thingies on the back of the brush</li>
            <li> The travel case for the Essence 5600 is a soft case, which is unlike the HealthyWhite&#x27;s hard case.  </li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive sonicare that i originally had</li>
            <li> Yes, there are some &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brushes without the head that you can buy, but the reviews seem to indicate that it&#x27;s next to impossible to get the original one off to install the replacement, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying those.  </li>
            <li> Big time two thumbs down!</li>
            <li> If you are afraid of the replacement brushes keep an eye out for “non brand name” ones that fit this.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> Just roughly 4 months into owning there brushes I told my wife that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Minus one star for the price of the refills on the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second round of anti-biotics (February 2015).  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t know the 30 sec timer was not on this unit.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks a noticed a big difference in the area where my veneers meet my gum line as well as the color and the results continue to improve.</li>
            <li> Be careful NOT to overuse the brush as overuse can take its toll on your tooth&#x27;s enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the blister pack it came in had a spot for and extra brush head, but is was empty.....</li>
            <li> I just got this, and the unit works well, as expected based on the reviews that I read.  </li>
            <li> after a few months of use my teeth feel like I left with a cleaning, and way cheaper than Wally World.</li>
            <li> This seems like a fairly arbitrary omission on Philips&#x27; part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really thought about giving an electric toothbrush a try...</li>
            <li> I went in with an open mind, and I immediately disliked the results.....</li>
            <li> It takes some adjustment to get used to keeping my mouth closed while brushing; if you don&#x27;t do this you will have spray everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I had been using electric toothbrushes that were low cost and basically disposable after a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it roughly two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Do this everyday and your next check up will be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your investment is minimal.  </li>
            <li> so if you travel outside the Americas, you have to carry a heavy converter (not adapter, voltage converter) or</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the two minute timer does not split into 30 second seconds the way other models do.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is also very small, so it is more difficult to get all-over coverage.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is too big for female hand, the way it vibrate is very annoying, its too strong, and you actually can&#x27;t brush your teeth with your mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I hit my back teeth they tend to slow down the actual brush strokes and bog the head of the tooth brush</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but not for long.</li>
            <li> REALIZE HOW WEAK IT WAS UNTIL I RECEIVED MY NEW ONE.</li>
            <li> Works just like my old one and is a whole lot less expensive on amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought an elite about 8 years ago and it just died the other day.</li>
            <li> It has a two minute timer, but it does not use the heads that the other Sonic Care toothbrushes use.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about cleaning it after reading other reviews with mold issues</li>
            <li> The other brand has a cmaller brush which can cause damage to the gum.</li>
            <li> I have one of these at home but decided to invest in one for work after a summer of traumatic and seemingly endless dental work.</li>
            <li> I have other sonicare units and they all had this feature.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that water collects, and eventually mold develops, in the area between the brush head and the charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was supposed to work with my other sonicare&#x27;s brush heads</li>
            <li> Water, toothpaste and any other liquids from your mouth goes inside and molds.</li>
            <li> I still use that one every morning, but I needed one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> other thing people complain about is that this brush doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds or whatever, but that&#x27;s also a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for two weeks that I know of, and even the charger is small enough to carry if you&#x27;re going to be gone longer than that.  </li>
            <li> almost double the amount I&#x27;ve paid for Oral-B replacement brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> I have always used Sonicare and would not use anything other brand.</li>
            <li> This is to be expected, and it does go away!  </li>
            <li> My other one of 10+ years needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually pretty skeptical when my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> All of the additional massage and pulsing modes and what-not are just irritating because it makes such a simple device much harder to use.  </li>
            <li> I can use other electric toothbrushes with rotating brushes like Oral B, just not this one.</li>
            <li> It eliminated problems I had with gingivitis and other stuff that gets under the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 of these brushes in the past 15+ years and won&#x27;t touch a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this new brush uses a different charging base, so our bathroom counter is more cluttered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after repeated requests by my doctor to &amp;#34;go electric&amp;#34; and using so many darn muscles to scrub my teeth with a boring old passive-bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So, the base at the bottom where the recharger is located and the top end, the brushing end, are much less of a quality product than the base mechanism, which houses the rechargeable battery and the mechanical parts.&lt;br /&gt;The travel bag is nice, and this brush stayed charged for four days, it may have gone longer</li>
            <li> This slot is 3-4 thousandths wide and at least that deep.</li>
            <li> The only trouble is the replacement heads are as expensive as a new unit...</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> This particular model only has a 2 minute timer, a disappointment.</li>
            <li> cleaning action is quite dramatic, and initially I felt like it was excessive.  </li>
            <li> it only comes with hard bristle heads.</li>
            <li> It hardly works and I&#x27;m getting another one that actually works.</li>
            <li> Although the Essence 5600&#x27;s case is smaller, the hard case for the HealthyWhite allows you to carry two brush heads.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested to me to get an electric toothbrush because I brush too hard and am starting to have receding gum lines.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as an average product.  </li>
            <li> My brushing time has increased from an average of 37.3 seconds to well over 90 seconds because I can just FEEL my teeth getting cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Will never own a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the cost of the replacement heads, ~$36 for four.</li>
            <li> A electric toothbrush can be a bit of a scary feeling on your first few uses but Philips has built in a gradual pacer that happens over 12 uses.  </li>
            <li> heads are replaceable at an average cost of $10per head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself seems to be either poorly designed or just an early design that&#x27;s never been improved upon.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to get a whole new ensemble than to replace the base that died.</li>
            <li> The people who complain about buildup under the head must be putting it all the way down their throats.  </li>
            <li> I looked inside and found that what runs down the toothbrush while brushing gets inside underneath where the head attaches.  </li>
            <li> Then, after you brush your teeth just run some water down in there to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> Everything is good,only a little harder!</li>
            <li> I returned to the USA 3 years ago and the power button failed last month; this recent purchase is a replacement.</li>
            <li> I had gotten used to my previous Sonicare that indicated when it was time to move on to another quadrant of your mouth while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this based on my use of my previous one, which died.</li>
            <li> It holds a usable charge for over two weeks, so you can leave charger at home for typical two week vacation travel.</li>
            <li> One month after purchasing and using this toothbrush I opened it up, to my surprise there was a bunch of black and brown mold in the handle.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> In fact we can go longer between teeth cleanings and those done are much less extensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Havent tested the batery life yet, but will soon.&lt;br /&gt;Only slightly annoing thing with this is it has a &#x27;brush timer&#x27; that turns the brush on for aprox 2 min and then turns off, so if you like to do a through job, may have to press the button twice.</li>
            <li> Broke after less than one year of use.</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> I can feel that my teeth are cleaner and know I am doing less damage to my gums.</li>
            <li> The one negative I would say about it is if you don&#x27;t regularly switch the brush heads water gets trapped between the brush head and the body.....</li>
            <li> Their gums are healthier and the dentist is noticing less plaque build up between cleanings</li>
            <li> also, the inside is magnetic and cleaning it/getting water on it ruins it after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;ll want to start brushing topless and not looking it the mirror, because the spit will be flying, and will make quite a mess.</li>
            <li> Once standing in the cradle, the liquid settles downwind by gravity and ends up the gooey mess in the cradle.</li>
            <li> When you twist off the replaceable toothbrush part (the whole white base of the toothbrush comes off) and inside it&#x27;s hollow</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you dont want to waste money on expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to charge with the charging base.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a circular electric toothbrush this one takes a little bit of adjustment.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> I think the timer should go a little longer also.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for a little over one month.</li>
            <li> noisey little thing.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but after using for a couple of months</li>
            <li> In other words, you will have to run it like a usual Ni-MH battery product to get the maximum life of maybe 3-5 years.  </li>
            <li> Get some small, sharp scissors or a box cutter or utility knife and cut off that rubber seal -- which doesn&#x27;t seal anyway.  </li>
            <li> Oh a little thing.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to, but works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, as I did, and note the past tense there!</li>
            <li> but much to my disappointment, I also found some alarming news about what you find when you take the old head off.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get used to but can tell it is working just after those few brushes.</li>
            <li> also the tooth brush head is too firm for the speed this cleans at.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed by the 24 hour waiting period for the initial charge.</li>
            <li> Switched over from an oral B electric toothbrush and boy I had no idea what I was missing before.</li>
            <li> so I started reading ALL the reviews, not just a few like when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> : The brush head is very tiny and thin.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a few months now</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was DOA (Dead on arrival).</li>
            <li> So far they seem to do their job without fail.</li>
            <li> It took a few times using it before my teeth got used to the vibrations</li>
            <li> Amazon and Philips do a poor job of describing the features on the various models of their electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a few compliments on my teeth looking whiter since I started using this Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The heads are expensive to buy, but it is far cheaper than being referred to the Periodontists office</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush everyday for almost a month without noticing a drop in brushing buzz strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now</li>
            <li> my 2nd Essence had the 5500 which lasted approximately 6yrs.</li>
            <li> used it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I feel like its too heavy to carry hehe</li>
            <li> That is to use the brush everyday for one week, THEN make you up your mind whether you like it or not.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;green police\\&quot; have convinced Phillips that when the battery gives out, the owner should take the handle apart to dispose of the batteries.</li>
            <li> To allow the handle to be broken open there is a slot for a screw driver to be used as a pry bar to break the seal between the halves.</li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Water and toothpaste can get into the head connection and it gets kind of nasty looking after a while.</li>
            <li> , however, I can say flossing is somewhat less painful even in the first few days of using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less toxic than toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My previous model had to be charged weekly, or.&lt;br /&gt;earlier!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used at least three other models.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive to both hot and cold, but mostly cold.</li>
            <li> the inside of the toothbrush is hollow so mold and grim collects inside very quickly.</li>
            <li> even with little flossing, Sonicare gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I was expecting at least the same features as my old toothbrush but am very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t provide me with the 30 second interval notice and does not indicate the level of charge.  </li>
            <li> She does brush hard, but I think the brush head is a little too small for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> else they burn out and (2) the brush head is poorly designed so that water and saliva goes down into a reservoir inside which becomes a gunky stinky mess.  </li>
            <li> very little attar.took a four day trip</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t choose any other make!!!</li>
            <li> Brush Heads are expensive and the generic replacements I have used are junk.  </li>
            <li> Yet, there is a small problem.</li>
            <li> The charger is 110V, which is not able to be used in China.</li>
            <li> My past Sonicare toothbrushes had the Quadrapacer enhancement on them.  </li>
            <li> After using this an ordinary one will not do</li>
            <li> Past the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> The old one was still working but how long was doubtful.  </li>
            <li> Small head is quite flexible in the mounth.</li>
            <li> I bought six replacement heads for the last one and it failed after I used three.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people spend $100</li>
            <li> I had already used a power toothbrush, so I&#x27;m not sure I noticed.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
            <li> Only wish the dual voltage one wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> If you change them as often as Sonicare recommends, you could spend a small fortune for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> but I now have to pay to ship it back (consequences of a wrong decision)</li>
            <li> How can you not love a Sonicare toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Like an electric razor, it seemed pointless</li>
            <li> I also like the carrying case which is small and holds the brush head and body</li>
            <li> Sadly, if they keep going up in price and lasting a shorter period of time I will need to move on to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the norm for electric toothbrushes; a charger; and a small storage bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think they would have a softer buffer on the neck of the brush, to prevent such an uncomfortable sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have purchased bedding, small appliances and books from Amazon with 100% satisfaction with price, quality and convenience.</li>
            <li> (I usually brush for 3 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to small children.  </li>
            <li> This one is thick and heavy, be prepared for this property.</li>
            <li> No more drainage in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for same unit with a worn out battery (really silly that batteries was  </li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I like the design and functionality it, a bit small but guess that comes with the territory,</li>
            <li> The base unit tends to last about 4 or 5 years, but should be cleaned very regularly.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, you can&#x27;t share brush heads between these 2 units because they have different connectors at the base of the brush</li>
            <li> My fiance and I had the same toothbrush, so we only kept one charging base on the counter and rotated as needed.</li>
            <li> You have to remove the head and clean contantly, otherwise you have nasty mildew mess inside there.</li>
            <li> Since my wife and I both have sonicare tooth brushes it is sometimes hard to tell the difference (just a small circle of color on the bottom of the head.)  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted me over 5 years before the base started yellowing.</li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s ticklish, almost to an annoying degree but don&#x27;t let that deter you from using this brush because the sensation goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads can get expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> The poor design allows water and saliva to run down inside the head and battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet disgusting and now we&#x27;re looking for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Using an electric toothbrush is the way to go for me because I tend to press too hard and compromise my already receding gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that while it has the automatic 2 minute timer, it does not have the 30 second quadrant signal that the other model had.  </li>
            <li> She recommended it because I had been brushing too hard with the manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine needing another electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Even as an entry level electric toothbrush this is a hard sell given the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to brush hard at all and let the brush do all the work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for at least 10 years including a model I bought in the UAE for 220v power 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I can use at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I let it charge for about 36 hours before using it and the charge lasted for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts for at least a week.</li>
            <li> You can charge it and bring it on vacation for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I e-mailed customer service with my findings and complaint.</li>
            <li> They gave me the name of someone to whom I could lodge a complaint.</li>
            <li> The alternating magnetic field that vibrates the brush also slowly weakens the magnets.</li>
            <li> Not sure i will buy another one till this works!</li>
            <li> No more bleeding gum while brushing teeth!</li>
            <li> How could you not love these things!</li>
            <li> When you take the head off to clean it there is gobs of nasty gunk inside it.</li>
            <li> Although it was shocking to use the first few times (The vibration made me feel like I was in a dentist chair.)</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with this is that water/spit gets between the brush and the base where it screws on.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by that, until I completely read the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Much less tarter.&amp;#34;  YES!!!</li>
            <li> That may be why it was less expensive, and I may just not have caught that in the description when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Seriously considering filing a lawsuit.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than even Costco.  </li>
            <li> Little expensive.</li>
            <li> The bacteria in the human mouthare an ugly bunch.</li>
            <li> Collecting and storing saliva in your tooth brush is not good.</li>
            <li> This item should still be working for at least a year!</li>
            <li> which can lead to some pretty nasty residue.</li>
            <li> Have no complaints and am using it at least twice a day!</li>
            <li> Just turn it on and you don&#x27;t even have to press very hard on your teeth.</li>
            <li> er, I mean, floss!</li>
            <li> The travel pouch is poor quality and tough to zip/</li>
            <li> , I was really annoyed that the Sonicare flung toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror and wall when I started it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist, but it splatters all over, which is totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> but I was never really happy with that.</li>
            <li> What I really don&#x27;t like about this is the terrible toothbrush heads which get funky.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth when I had a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> complaint: the toothbrush heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> The charging base is larger and the handle of the brush is wider.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s charged it will last for up to 2 weeks without being in the charger base.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s charged it will last for up to 2 weeks without being in the charger base.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried the Sonicare, the action of the brush was so violent I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that my brushing was bad but like a lot of people I was missing spots at times.</li>
            <li> The thought of that stuff being anywhere near your mouth is disgusting!</li>
            <li> Human bites area very bad.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time :(</li>
            <li> but for the price I can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> , the brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with nasty, gunky water and mold inside my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It works as an electric toothbrush, but the sheer amount of mold that starts growing in all the crevices is absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, I have to say I am not terribly impressed.</li>
            <li> Useless brush.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re unable to brush your teeth if you don&#x27;t know whether 30 seconds have passed?  </li>
            <li> In addition, the replacement brush heads are incredibly expensive --</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement heads are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> it was too expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry about that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever accidentally grab the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> I always thought electric toothbrushes were silly, but no, they work.</li>
            <li> False advertising here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for 6 month and have found it to be very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous that I have to type a minimum number of words to say what I have to in maybe 6 or7!!</li>
            <li> disappointed it doesn&#x27;t warn you before battery completely loses it&#x27;s charge.</li>
            <li> and i noticed that &amp;#34;liquids&amp;#34; get down into it which is disgusting.</li>
            <li> Water get trapped between the brush head and body allowing for bacteria and a horrible odor to developers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with plaque and my old-school manual method of brushing just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore.</li>
            <li> But inexplicably the company never refers to it that way.  </li>
            <li> (that wasn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive!).</li>
            <li> then there&#x27;s something wrong with you!</li>
            <li> the brush head is too expensive!</li>
            <li> is how the charging instructions in the manual are WRONG!</li>
            <li> I find quad pacer useless and annoying.  </li>
            <li> it would be impossible not to like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> GOING BAD  </li>
            <li> My gums are in bad shape and some have eroided away from my teeth creating pockets which keep getting infected.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years after my dentist pointed out that I had really bad plaque.  </li>
            <li> Its a place where mold can grow and cause it to smell badly.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t matter mold will form and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> A lot of the bad reviews are about mold build up</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re trying to save money, but it&#x27;s too bad for the purchaser.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it does not have the quad pacer.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t. :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush about a month and am quite disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed, an investment in your oral health.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t affect the usage, I makes me very unhappy about the product quality.</li>
            <li> Broken in two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BRUSH AND BOTTOM OF THE CHARGING BASE.</li>
            <li> We share one base among 4.  </li>
            <li> place handle on base</li>
            <li> but I do take the head off mine and rinse about every 10 days since I get toothpaste buildup at the base of the head.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s some crap.</li>
            <li> I don’t see that the base of the brush head ever gets any gunk on it.  </li>
            <li> This one is the base model and works well and does what you need.</li>
            <li> so there is no need to take the charger base with us for our shorter trips.</li>
            <li> Does come with base charger and travel pouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a disgusting pig and just build a habit of cleaning the brush every week.</li>
            <li> Sickening!</li>
            <li> So it can be disgusting if you don&#x27;t know about it and leave the tooth brush screwed on.</li>
            <li> However, the design is incredibly horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst toothbrush in the world.</li>
            <li> So disappointing !!!!</li>
            <li> Just truly disgusting which is why you see some aftermarket (non-Philips) seals being sold.  </li>
            <li> but the design is horrible since it allows the build up of mold on the inside no matter what you do.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a replacement for the same Sonicare I had for 14 years</li>
            <li> Works great/don&#x27;t use it every day-it strips the enamel- it only comes with hard bristle heads.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. I bought an elite about 8 years ago and it just died the other day. I hope this one can hold up as well and so far my teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order. I love it.</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get used to but can tell it is working just after those few brushes. I smooth toothpaste over teeth before starting it up and found that works well. Great product!</li>
            <li> It was excellent thank you</li>
            <li> The product was as I expected, it came very quickly and I am very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare brushes were old and it was cheaper to buy this entire kit, than to find replacement brush heads for the older model. This one is just as good as my old one. Has a 2-minute timer so it turns off at that point while brushing.</li>
            <li> Brushes my teeth like a boss.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare.  Can&#x27;t say enough about them.  Have used them for a very long time.</li>
            <li> MY FAMILIES FAVORITE!!</li>
            <li> Great price.  One model old but still terrific.</li>
            <li> Works great, very reasonably priced. It is a little heavier than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> As far as the brush goes, it is okay for a basic toothbrush. But, why Philips would make a toothbrush without the quad timer is beyond me. I purchased the same model over 15 years ago and it had the quad timer. I am returning the toothbrush and getting the next model up.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old one, which lasted almost five years. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I charge it once a week and it handles twice daily brushing chores. Only downer is I take it on the road everywhere and they no longer provide the hard plastic travel case, and the one from my old unit doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> great product, I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> like everyone is saying. the inside of the toothbrush is hollow so mold and grim collects inside very quickly. you have to clean and maintain the inside every couple days unless you want to smell mold everytime you brush your teeth. also, the inside is magnetic and cleaning it/getting water on it ruins it after a few washes. right now, the charge only lasts for about 20 seconds on 3 hour charge. originally, the tooth brush lasted 5 months w/out having to recharge it but once the battery died and i had to recharge it, it pretty much stopped working and is useless. also the tooth brush head is too firm for the speed this cleans at. my dentist reccomends using an electric toothbrush with a &#x27;extra soft&#x27; head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully no one else will make the same mistake i did buy buying this particular model</li>
            <li> Item received and functions as advertised.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it so I tried it; I am so glad I did.This is much better than the battery operated ones and much more cost efficient.I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had the first generation Sonicare, which finally died on me after nearly ten years. The only practical and discernible difference between this one and my original Sonicare is that it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds. So, if you need a reminder on when it&#x27;s time to switch sections of the mouth (and it&#x27;s worth $30+ to you), then you can upgrade to the next model. Otherwise, this does what you would expect a Sonicare to do: Give you a nice clean brushing. Using an electric toothbrush is the way to go for me because I tend to press too hard and compromise my already receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush came completely uncharged. I plugged it in before bed and it was done charging by the time I woke up. I used it until the light started blinking (telling me that the charge was low). Same thing, plugged it in at night and it was done by the morning. Each charge lasts about two weeks. From experience (as with all rechargeable electronics), the ability to hold a charge greatly decreases with age. Toward the end, my original Sonicare stayed in the charging cradle after each use.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really amazing! I have never owned a motorized toothbrush before, it is a really nice change over the traditional simple brush. This brush goes above and beyond cleaning your teeth, you can feel it really get into the tight spots as you glide over your teeth. At first, you will feel an intense tickling sensation but you will get used to it. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this but, you will have so much fun cleaning your teeth that you will be eager to clean them as soon as you can. I recommend this toothbrush because you get amazing professional looking results in one day! This unit is also rechargeable which is a great feature.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare for many years and finally it just stopped charging.  Just got this new one and am still happy with the product.  My teeth feel so much cleaner than if I use a regular brush and I almost never have plaque buildup.  The only difference with this model is it does not have timed sequences like my original model - not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I love it I just went to my dentist he said he didn&#x27;t have to clean much of my gums because I am doing a great job.This combined with flossing is great for your teeth.</li>
            <li> One can reverse gum deterioration with the consistent use of this electric toothbrush.  It has worked for me for several years.</li>
            <li> Works great and is adequate for the price.  The only thing I am missing is that the sonicare this replaced had a timer set for every 30 seconds where it would pause briefly reminding me to shift zones.  This one does not.</li>
            <li> Good value and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is working great for us.  Ou dentist is pleased, as well.  It does a great job of cleaning teeth &amp; our gums are healthy, as well.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED 2 OF THESE AND THEY BOTH SECRETE A STICKY RUBBER-LIKE SUBSTANCE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BRUSH AND BOTTOM OF THE CHARGING BASE. HAPPENS OVERNITE AND IS NOT EASY TO CLEAN IT OFF. NO CLUE WHERE IT IS COMING FROM.</li>
            <li> It has a two minute timer, but it does not use the heads that the other Sonic Care toothbrushes use.  These head twist on like lid.  The two-minute timer does not break the brushing up into segments. I would recommend the kids&#x27; version of this toothbrush instead of this one.</li>
            <li> I love this little toothbrush! My teeth are much cleaner now when i go in to the dentist, and my gums are also doing better since I know longer brush to hard.</li>
            <li> This replaced a more expensive model but very few differences are noted.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best and GREAT service</li>
            <li> Works well. Quality product</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush now. Just two minutes and your done!</li>
            <li> this was purchased to replace the last one I had for several years.  I wouldn&#x27;t choose any other make!!!</li>
            <li> I Love my Sonicare! it gets my teeth a lot cleaner than my manual brush ever did. Reccomend to everyone for better dental care!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say....Sonicare is great &amp; my dentist agrees</li>
            <li> Very efficient. My teeth were so much whiter after just one week.</li>
            <li> My hygenist can tell when I am using this brush, she tells me my teeth are cleaner and my gums are healthier...well the gums have more to do with regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this makes my teeth feel afterwards, so smooth! Will never go back to manual toothbrush after this. Totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, you only need to brush and floss the teeth you want to keep :)</li>
            <li> I needed a spare Sonicare and this is great.</li>
            <li> Very effective so far.....</li>
            <li> great  very cheap  and useful</li>
            <li> Brush Heads are expensive and the generic replacements I have used are junk.  The actual toothbrush works really great though.</li>
            <li> The battery stopped charging at about day 45 of owning it. It was no longer returnable at that point. I would&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Most powerful toothbrush ever used</li>
            <li> I previously owned a quad-pacer model which lasted more than five years. This one lacks that notification feature, and I miss it. I bought this model because I had on hand six replacement brushes for the defunct model that I was replacing. I was annoyed by the 24 hour waiting period for the initial charge. Also the charging stand is flimsy compared with the older one (which, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t work with the newer one), and despite my fastidious attempts to clean the bottom of the toothbrush each time before replacing it in the charger, enough toothpaste residue persists which acts like glue so that when you pick up the toothbrush to use it again the whole charge apparatus comes up with it,  stuck to the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> Did you see the great price?</li>
            <li> I have owned several Sonicare and this is by far the model to NOT get. A couple months ago my wife and I needed to replace our toothbrushes so we picked up the 2 pack of the Essence model shown here. We opted for this one because of the lower cost compared to the Sonicare HealthyWhite (5 series) which was like $40 more. Huge mistake!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Essence is no where near as powerful as the HealthyWhite and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets your teeth fully cleaned. But the biggest issue with the Essence model is the heads. They screw on to the brush and have a large opening inside the head that collects moisture. When you take the head off to clean it there is gobs of nasty gunk inside it. The thought of that stuff being anywhere near your mouth is disgusting! Just roughly 4 months into owning there brushes I told my wife that&#x27;s it were getting a different brush. She was in complete agreement. So we went to the store and picked up the 2 pack of the HealthyWhite brushes with the DiamondClean heads. The difference is night and day. Your teeth feel spotless after brushing and there is no disgusting buildup growing inside the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying these Essence brushes...DON&#x27;T! You will regret it if you do. Spend the extra coin and get any of the models, even the 2 Series, just as long as it doesn&#x27;t have the screw on heads.</li>
            <li> Like many products today this &amp;#34;newer and improved&amp;#34; electric toothbrush is less sturdy and less easy to use than the original version or even the last version before this. Previous products lasted longer, fit one;s hand better to enable more effective and easy use of the brush in the mouth. I would rate this as an average product.  Packaging was good. Phillips is a manufacturer that is slightly less likely than others to send defective or shaoddy products to the market.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Worked according to the directions. I love it.</li>
            <li> Attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need an expensive electric toothbrush to clean your teeth!  If I were being obnoxious I would write that statement over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not obnoxious so I won&#x27;t [lol] but all kidding aside this is a great toothbrush.  I&#x27;m not an orthodontist or even a dentist so I don&#x27;t have much more to give. I know that my teeth is routinely clean and my breath never stinks, score!</li>
            <li> Very good for a pure teeth cleaning.  I must have missed reading the fine print since the last time I bought this&lt;br /&gt;product it came with two brushes instead of just one.........S.G.,  CA</li>
            <li> Changed my life! The dentist is nice now! I don&#x27;t get the same accumulations of plaque in certain areas. I used to think electric toothbrushes were too foofy or high maintenance for me but now I&#x27;VE SEEN THE LIGHT</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but for the price I can&#x27;t go wrong.  Have been using Sonicare for 10 years and what a differance it has made with my dental care.  Whoever said one lasted them five yrs did good or didn&#x27;t use it.  Mine last 1-11/2 year and needs to be replaced.  But its well worth the money.  What I spend on this I save from not having to see a dentist.  Great Tool</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD NO ISSUES THIS IS MY 4TH SONICARE OVER MANY YEARS!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Feels like you get a professional clean from the dentist every time!</li>
            <li> It works great, but the product&#x27;s appearance sucks!</li>
            <li> Bought a 2nd one for convenience (now I can use it while my wife is brushing her teeth). No cavities since using this product for over a year.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s Sonicare had finally died, so I ordered this replacement set from Amazon.com  Everything works as expected, charges well, and is the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Delivery was on time as stated. Will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> It works really well and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review about the toothbrush itself, not the service/buying experience. This was my first electric toothbrush and I am replacing it with the Philips Sonicare EasyClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with the comfort, ease, and clean feeling my teeth had when first using this toothbrush, but THE GROSS BLACK MOLD that forms EVERY TIME underneath the brush head just is NOT ACCEPTABLE! The manual says to take the brush head off every week to air dry it, but who really has the time to do that? That&#x27;s not the customer&#x27;s responsibility, it is a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get this, just opt for the other sonicare brushes that have the different brush head style.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same sonicare toothbrush since I was probably about 9 years old (I am now 23). The toothbrush finally died and would no longer charge and i was devastated because i didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a toothbrush like it (that wasn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive!). Thankfully, I found this toothbrush and it works just as well as my old toothbrush. It holds a nice charge for quite a while so it&#x27;s not necessary to take the charger on a short vacation. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth and is not too big to fit in the small areas of my mouth. I highly recommend buying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a circular electric toothbrush this one takes a little bit of adjustment. It really gyrates pretty heavily and you will want to turn it off before taking it out of your mouth unless you want specks of toothpaste all over you and your bathroom counter/mirror. But with that said, it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is awesome - very powerful cleaning motion.  I had a different model and this is so much better.  I was worried about cleaning it after reading other reviews with mold issues but they are all USER ERROR!  This thing is easy to clean...just unscrew the head and rinse out.  If you are not unscrewing it once per week to clean inside then there&#x27;s something wrong with you!</li>
            <li> Great price for the basic model</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and I love it. There&#x27;s basically, no going back to the manual toothbrush. I&#x27;ve read some of the review on Amazon and heard complaints about the mold buildup. I get it, but I don&#x27;t get it, because I clean my product every week and its fine. Don&#x27;t be a disgusting pig and just build a habit of cleaning the brush every week. If you do, then you don&#x27;t have to pay more than $50 (or $100 for some) for a product that essentially does the same thing. Be smart, be timely, and be clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 months and it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!  Makes brushing twice as fast and easy as a regular toothbrush.  Quiet to use.  Easy clean up.  Easy to change the head.</li>
            <li> I purchased the original in 2001; the body and charger lasted until autumn of 2013 with nary a problem. (Hope this one continues that dependability.) Because batteries and wirings have improved in the last decade, with this new unit I plan to fully charge it for 48 hours and then use it daily but let it set out of the charger for four or five days, in hopes that will help the battery last longer.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me he wanted me to come in for a cleaning twice per year, but if I agreed to use one of these I could come once per year. It seemed to be a luxury, but it&#x27;s worth it. After I got one my wife got one, too. Now she won&#x27;t use her old toothbrush (I&#x27;m cheap, I only use the Sonicare in the evening and a manual one in the morning.) This really cleans teeth much better than can be done with a regular (or a cheap electric) toothbrush. It can save you in dentist bills far more than the price for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have received the package, the teeth brush is very good. Yet, there is a small problem. The charger is 110V, which is not able to be used in China. However, when I bought it, there is no obvious warning mark this problem. If it is possible, I hope the webpage can be modified in the furture.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. I am disappointed that it does not have the quad pacer.</li>
            <li> Excellent item to get for brushing your teeth well.</li>
            <li> Phillips sonicare HX5610/01 Essence 5600  Works just fine but it&#x27;s not as good as the 18 year old model it has replced.</li>
            <li> We love our new electric toothbrushes-love how my teeth feel after I brush for 2 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and a good price. I may have to hunt for replacement heads, as it looks like this one is not being made anymore, but I&#x27;ve found several generic replacements online.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model less than 2 months ago and with twice daily use and regular charging, the battery no longer lasts a full two minutes without needing another charge. Poorly-made, and of course the warranty is only 30 days...</li>
            <li> Product does its job. However the battery does not hold a charge long enough to brush teeth thoroughly. (the 2 minutes recommended in the instruction manual) Not surprised though being that the battery is not a lithium battery. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Vastly improved handle and brush in comparison with my former brush, as well a the best price I found by comparison.</li>
            <li> good price and good stuff!</li>
            <li> My girlfriends teeth are probably getting whiter, and while dentistry and gum disease is only a hobby of mine, I&#x27;m confident that we&#x27;re making progress on that front as well.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had a lot of different &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34; before and they&#x27;ve all been fine. They &amp;#34;did the job&amp;#34; I suppose. This one really turned me around on electric toothbrushes though. First off it just feels powerful when using it on your teeth and it is simply effortless to use. Just turn it on and you don&#x27;t even have to press very hard on your teeth. Just let it knock all the junk off. I brush my teeth for a minute or so and they just feel so smooth afterwards. My teeth appear much cleaner as well. I highly recommend this product since it cleans so well you&#x27;ll more than likely save on going to the dentist as less cavities are sure to be a side effect of using this combined with perhaps an air/water pik. I also enjoy that it comes with a traveling bag and seems to hold a charge for quite a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a different, similar model.  I was disappointed that while it has the automatic 2 minute timer, it does not have the 30 second quadrant signal that the other model had.  Oh well, the price was right.</li>
            <li> Bought after being recommended. Thoroughly happy with the unit. Mouth feels very clean. Have noticed an improvement in my gums.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my grandmother. She really enjoys using it. It&#x27;s easy to use and we love that the charging base isn&#x27;t overcomplicated for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare toothbrush since it first came out.  Once you use this product, you can never go back to a regular toothbrush because it does a terrific job cleaning your teeth and is most effective.  After the first time you use it, you feel as if you went for a rigorous teeth cleaning at the dentist office.  The only problem is that the packaging includes an area for another toothbrush replacement head but it only comes with one.</li>
            <li> On time and new as stated.</li>
            <li> my teeth  are clean now .</li>
            <li> After 10+ years my Sonicare handle died.  This one is just as great as the old and the old charger works with it too.  NOt an exact fit but charges and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for at least 10 years including a model I bought in the UAE for 220v power 5 years ago. I returned to the USA 3 years ago and the power button failed last month; this recent purchase is a replacement. It is also  a great product.</li>
            <li> i like it and it takes a little time to be used with the sound and vibration, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Very good value for sonicare product.  Works just like my old sonicare elite brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working in my country because it&#x27;s 120volt and I am living in 220voltage country.. What a waste of money and time :(</li>
            <li> Switched over from an oral B electric toothbrush and boy I had no idea what I was missing before. Sonic toothbrush is great and really feels so much cleaner afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get a deal on a good electric toothbrush because I could finally get my dentist off my back about it. However, when I tried the Sonicare, the action of the brush was so violent I was unable to use it. Maybe my teeth are extra sensitive, but I found the vibration to be too much to handle. It hurt a lot. And as a point of reference, I brush my teeth two to three times a day with a manual toothbrush, as well as floss and mouthwash, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m just starting to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was really annoyed that the Sonicare flung toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror and wall when I started it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m sure some people can stand the vibration and I can see the advantages of an electric toothbrush. But people with sensitive teeth may want to find another model.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a quadrant timer</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! It stays charged for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li> The people who complain about buildup under the head must be putting it all the way down their throats.  It works fine, and is easy to rinse and clean.  I love it, as much as one can love a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Necessity for good care for your teeth.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was initially pleased with this toothbrush until I started looking for replacement heads.  I couldn&#x27;t find the right ones so I started reading ALL the reviews, not just a few like when I purchased it.  I found out what people are buying to replace the heads but much to my disappointment, I also found some alarming news about what you find when you take the old head off.  EEEEWWWW!!!!  I looked inside and found that what runs down the toothbrush while brushing gets inside underneath where the head attaches.  It was pretty gross to say the least. Today is April 24 and I purchased on March 4.  I tried to hit the return button on my orders from Amazon but apparently I waited too long.  I had no idea I would WANT to return this.  My teeth do feel a lot cleaner than when I use a manual toothbrush but I&#x27;ll be looking for one that does not collect what I brush off my teeth.  Sickening!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. It really works.</li>
            <li> I have use this for years.  I ordered this one because the old one finally wore out.  I have disassembled one of these.  Inside, the components are set in potting compound.  This thing is sturdy.  I would have no hesitation to put this through a diswasher.  The bristles are soft, but the rapid motion makes it a very effective brush.  I have seen nothing to compare to it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My old one finally pooped out. This one works great and has the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Its a tooth brush.  It vibrates. It brings my lazyness to a whole new level. Love it.</li>
            <li> the brush head is too expensive!</li>
            <li> works great,very happy w/ purchase</li>
            <li> While I think this is a great toothbrush, I wish the it had a variable timer. The On time is set for 2 minutes, like it or not. If you want more time but want to set it to a different fixed value, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush heads are expensive. If you but the six-pack here on Amazon, they&#x27;re over $7.00 a piece. That&#x27;s at a discount! At Wal-Mart, the 2-pack makes them $15.xx a head!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model is all you need. Will truly improve the health of your gums and cleanliness of your mouth. I now have no issues when I see my dentist, whereas before my teeth typically needed more work.</li>
            <li> Perfect brusher, be worth to bought</li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive sonicare that i originally had and I like it better</li>
            <li> I like it but it does not have the feature of beeping every 30 seconds to help space out your two minute brushing process.  My original one had this feature and I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and they are still using it :D</li>
            <li> Got this on sale, love it! Works great.</li>
            <li> Good electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first sonicare that stopped holding a charge after several years.  I love this toothbrush!  It feel like I get a professional clean every time I brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years. I&#x27;ve always been satisfied. Haven&#x27;t tried the competition. Why 4 rather than 5? No serious problems. But nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> It gives me a better brush experience.</li>
            <li> It was great until it stopped working after 5 months of use</li>
            <li> It vibrates really loud. Love it though</li>
            <li> I really like this - it is a turbo-toothbrush</li>
            <li> Our aunt received this as a gift and likes it much.  Finds it easy on the gums and great in cleaning (wife and I own as well and find it great).</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush.  I am absolutely loving it. Saves me time and so much energy. And I gain clean beautiful teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale and I wanted to replace by $10 spinbrush with a rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The charging station is pretty cool - it seems to leverage wireless charging since there are no connections between the station and the brush.  The brush is very vigorous and feel like you got a dentist-style cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The brush head is very tiny and thin.  Maybe this is just a thing with how I brush but I constantly hit the vibrating plastic part against my teeth when using this.  I never had this problem with old spinbrush.  Also toothpaste seems to spray everywhere if you are not careful.  The charger light stays on if you charge over night which can be distracting if you don&#x27;t have a door between the bathroom and bedroom.  Water seems to get between the charger station and the toothbrush often resulting in icky green mold that I have to clean off about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again particularly if it was more expensive than the sale price ($25).</li>
            <li> Works fine and good price.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare. I have bee using it for 5 years now. Great product. Just make sure you renew the brushes every 6 months. Sonicare is better then the other brand . The other brand has a cmaller brush which can cause damage to the gum. The pouch is hand for traveling.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few months now and i love it! Easy to use, clean and transport!</li>
            <li> Pleased to find this at this price.  It seems to hold charge longer than my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> It is great. The vibration is good. the charging rate is fast.</li>
            <li> This puppy will really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this model does not come with quadpacer, so while it works okay, one of the key features I like about Sonicare brushes is missing. I will have to buy another one....</li>
            <li> Good product.  It works as advertised.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. This toothbrush is excellent in keeping your teeth clean</li>
            <li> not so good ,,,, its too noisy &amp; vibrate wired &amp; its very heavy too ...not so good for this price.....</li>
            <li> Dental hygienist said at last cleaning, &amp;#34; You have started using a Sonicare, haven&#x27;t you? Much less tarter.&amp;#34;  YES!!!</li>
            <li> very powerful and able to clean my teeth great</li>
            <li> I should have bought one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Works well, but occasionally turns itself back on after I turn it off. Didn&#x27;t have that problem with my last sonicare.</li>
            <li> This product lasted about a year then stopped working.  I had a very good experience with their healthy white product, but I settled for this model to save a few bucks, but that was a mistake.  The healthy white model lasted at least three years.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Did not need all the bells &amp; whistles of more expensive Sonicare.  Easy to operate,&lt;br /&gt;2 min timer a plus, helps with peridontal problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using a sonicare toothbrush for more than 5 years. It cleans the best of any automatic tooth brush I have ever used. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that mold can form inside the brush housing due to moisture.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush components -- nothing fancy, just exactly what you think you are paying for.</li>
            <li> Love it! I can always tell when I have not used my sonic care. The action is just right, not too hard, but effective enough to get the grit and film off my teeth left by my numerous medications.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the one I replaced that I&#x27;ve had for probably 10 years. However, this cheaper model seems to have issues with the charge indicating light. Or perhaps the charging process in general is finicky.</li>
            <li> Great product. My second one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Product works well, disappointed it doesn&#x27;t warn you before battery completely loses it&#x27;s charge.</li>
            <li> It does a great job with very high speed vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;Each overnight charge lasts about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Replacement for unit bought couple of years ago and seems to work as well. Use it twice a day and my hygienist can never find enough to do at my 6 month cleanings. Does what it should and that is all one can ask.</li>
            <li> The vibrations did take some time to get used to .... I can report, that so far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Great CD  Loved it. Good service.  All the songs were very good.  Would highly recommend it.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamela Rice</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush before and it lasted me over 8yrs before the battery went low.  I loved it so much that not only did I buy the same one again, I&#x27;m also taking a break from watching porn to give it a good review.</li>
            <li> best purchase I have ever made in a toothbrush</li>
            <li> this does the trick- works well</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. It&#x27;s hard to switch to electronic after being with a manual for so long, so this one feels a little powerful to me right now- but I&#x27;ll get used to it. Would purchase again or recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Sonicare for about 3 weeks now and I am impressed with how well it works.  I like the 2 minute timer that helps me stay on track and take care of my teeth.  I was impressed with the speed in which it was delivered.  Good oral health does not have to cost a lot, I am so happy that I bought this item.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. Great buy for the money. Love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare product, and I have been happy with both.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I have one of these at home but decided to invest in one for work after a summer of traumatic and seemingly endless dental work. Brushing during the day after coffee and lunch has made a really big difference-&lt;br /&gt;My breath is super fresh, and lots of people have been commenting on how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li> It has been three months since I purchased this product and I can say that it is a wonderful toothbrush.  My mouth feels better and cleaner than when my dental hygienist cleans my teeth.  I look forward to brushing my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says this is the only toothbrush anyone should ever use and I agree! Buy one now at this good price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted andneeded</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was exactly what I was hoping for! My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Love this device.  I have been using one for over 10 years and can say that it does live up to its reputation.  The only quibble is battery life (it&#x27;s a NiCad device with the usual issues with battery memory) and you need to keep the device clean.</li>
            <li> IT IS GREAT ONE.IT CAN MEET YOUR BASIC REQUIR OF OARAL CLEANIC.I FEEL THE HANDLE A LITTLE BIG.WHATEVER I like it!</li>
            <li> My first soniccare tooth brush and now I know what all the buzz is about. It really makes your teeth clean and feel clean after brushing. It charges fast and has a internal timer.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.  I am kind of concerned with how to get reasonably priced replacement heads though.</li>
            <li> Second one of these I&#x27;ve owned (the first one lasted a long time and is still holding a charge but my dentist suggested I get a new one)  Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I was using a oral B I thought I would try this tooth bush for a change so far it has been working just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Effective. does a better job than I apparently can do manually. Form factor is functional, could get one more slender for twice the money but did pay for the ability to recharge as I deemed that important, being sexy not so much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> very good, easy to use. but the voltage is not correct.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this type of brush and she has used them for years.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit for the size of the brush head. It is small and easy to maneuver in your mouth. Unlike some of the cheaper battery powered make which are like trying to put a Peterbuilt semi in your mouth.But this unit does take a week or so to really get used to it. It tickles a lot because of the type of movement. But once you are past the initial uncomfortableness, it works great.</li>
            <li> This was my second Sonicare Essence toothbrush, and it is even better than the first.  The switch is easier to work, and the brush head is easier to align when replacing it after cleaning.  This toothbrush is pleasant to use, and is much more effective against plaque than a manual toothbrush.  My dental hygienist told me my teeth are cleaner using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare products for over 15 years and am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this product I wish I had paid closer attention to the description.  My past Sonicare toothbrushes had the Quadrapacer enhancement on them.  This one does not.  It still does a good job but I have to watch my time so I get each section of my mouth properly cleaned, i.e., 30 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush out there! This one is a bit cheaper than the others but it seems to last longer. Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this brush because of the built in timer and the cleaning it provides. It takes a couple of weeks to get used to the tickling sensation it gives but you&#x27;ll soon grow used to it. Minus one star for the price of the refills on the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Better than any old toothbrush</li>
            <li> These were purchased as gifts and the recipients just LOVED them…I knew they would as I have one and the toothbrush is unmatched in quality.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare years ago which I did like. It did take over a month to see results with my first one. With this Sonicare, I have seen results in a week!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a Christmas present for my son on a Saturday five days before Christmas and it was on my doorstep Christmas Eve! I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would make it on time, but it did.  Very happy with it.  My son loves it!  I loved the price!</li>
            <li> Everything my dentist said it would be.</li>
            <li> very useful and can be used in long time after charged, it&#x27;s convenient to a little bag when travlling.</li>
            <li> First e-brush ever. Does much better job than I&#x27;ve been doing manually. Takes a little getting used to, but not for long. Should have had this years ago.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner than it did before!  I got this because my dentist recommended it.  I like that it has the timer so I can make sure that I am actually brushing the recommended time.  Bonus, it wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Toothbrush products are great.  This one replaced one we&#x27;ve had for years.  The new one performs well and we expect to get many years of dependable service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years and have nothing but positive things to say about them; the Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve had.  The other 3 are the FlexCare, Healthy White, and the older Elite models.  The Essence 5600 is similar in design to the Elite series brushes.  It has a larger body and a screw on type brush head.  The major advantage this model has over all the other models I&#x27;ve owned is that it has stronger action in the brush head.  My teeth feel like they get a more thorough cleaning when using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cool feature for anyone new to using an electric toothbrush is the Ramp-up mode. This allows your gums to slowly get adjusted to the action of the brush head over the first twelve uses.  My first electric toothbrush didn&#x27;t have this feature and it took me awhile to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it&#x27;s convenient for traveling.  The Essence 5600 lasts up to two weeks on a single charge and also comes with a cloth carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disadvantage for me is the design of the brush head.  Fluids are more prone to collect in the bottom part of the head between the body and where the head screws on.  My FlexCare and Healthy White brushes attach to the body right at the base of the neck so fluid doesn&#x27;t collect on the inside.  With the Essence 5600,  I have to clean out fluids twice as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this issue,  I&#x27;d still recommend this product.  The Sonicare Essence 5600 is a solid performer.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this toothbrush. Best thing my dentist has ever recommended to me. I am going to purchase a second one for my beach home.</li>
            <li> first time i use Philips Sonicare and im in love with it! now i wont stop using this nice tooth brush, i think heads replacement are a little pricey but still worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonicare in about 10 years.  I love these!  My last one gave out after 8 months, though, so I am hoping this one lasts longer.  There is nothing like the way your teeth feel after you use this.  Clean, clean, clean...</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush was an excellent replacement for my older toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX5610/01 is a great product. One 8 hours charge I can use at least 3 weeks. It&#x27;s very convenience for travel. I will use Philips Sonicare brand for more than 16 years. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both ordered this toothbrush and we both like it.  The sonic cleaning somewhat tickles but it does a gray job.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I didn&#x27;t know much about the Philips Sonicare toothbrush until my last visit with my dentist.  She recommended it because I had been brushing too hard with the manual toothbrush.  I gave it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I don&#x27;t regret spending a single penny on this purchase/investment.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Cleans well every time.  Dentist noticed vast improvements between check ups.  Easy to keep toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> This was delivered March 29, 2015. After charging it would last almost two weeks.  Suddenly last week it will only hold a charge for two to three days with similar usage. I purchased this to replace an 3 year old oral B for the same reason.</li>
            <li> My family has used one of these for over 5 years.  We share one base among 4.  Our first lasted for 5 years, then died. I am completely satisfied with that level of performance, given that we use it a lot, and drop it a lot.  Teeth are so much clearer than traditional brushing.  I will never go back.</li>
            <li> This is my third one. It is a great toothbrush for the money. I tried to return to a manual one but missed the clean feeling of an electric brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was DOA (Dead on arrival). Charged for several hours adn even days but it wont charge. Problem: no way to return</li>
            <li> NIce, does a much better job than a battery operated toothbrush it replaced or a manual one. I like the timer and the sealed design.</li>
            <li> We love our new toothbrushes. They do an excellent job of cleaning and I can definitely tell a difference between a manual and electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> what can i say, it works</li>
            <li> now I just got remember to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Sonicore, need I say more. It does just what it is suppose to. My last one lasted many years. I had it so long I don&#x27;t remember when I purchased it. This is a really excellent product.</li>
            <li> I LIKE  THE TOOTHBRUSH  BECAUSE  IT  IS ELECTRIC AND  THE  BATTERIES WERE ALWAYS  GOING BAD  AND I WAS ALWAYS CHANGING  THEM  SO I  GIVE IT  GOOD RATING  ALWAYS  DOT</li>
            <li> Overall is good, only the sound is a bit loud. if there&#x27;s one more bruch as backup would be better.</li>
            <li> I love using my sonicare tooth brush. I feel like I am getting a thorough brushing. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare HX56 Essense 5600 - I wouldn&#x27;t be without. You will notice a huge change in the health of your gums and teeth when you start using this product!!!!!  A great gift ide too and really reasonably priced!!!!!!!!!!!! B RW</li>
            <li> after 5 months of using you can&#x27;t use it anymore. you have to change the heads, then it will you 40 to 50 dollars for six new brush heads and its hard to clean!</li>
            <li> i dont know why it took me so long to buy one of these...i love it. I ended up buying my wife one as well...</li>
            <li> My first mechanical toothbrush, so I have no other device to compare it to besides the manual brush. So far they seem to do their job without fail.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush especially for the price.  My only complaint is the handle is large and heavy.  I feel like it needs to be more ergonomic to be able to hold onto easily.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Works well.</li>
            <li> Although it was shocking to use the first few times (The vibration made me feel like I was in a dentist chair.), I truly love how clean my teeth get with this toothbrush.  I am used to the vibrations and looks forward to brushing.I have had the misfortune of taking my toothbrush out of my mouth while it was still running.  Don&#x27;t do that.  Toothpaste everywhere.  :)  But, I think most users would know that piece of common sense already.&lt;br /&gt;It recharges well - took 24 hours the first time, and charges within a day now.  I have had it for over a month.  It&#x27;s a dream.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush makes my teeth feel clean &amp; look wonderful!. Better than regular toothbrush! Buy it yourself &amp; Believe!</li>
            <li> Sonicare has improved the health of my teeth and gums.  My dentist recomended it and he is happy with the health of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Although this is an older model toothbrush it works well for my needs. The last one I had lasted for several years and I hope that&#x27;s the case for this one too. It was delivered promptly and at a great price.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner since I began using the Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. With its simple setup and easy-to-understand instructions, this electric toothbrush does a great job without being too harsh or abrasive. Though there are more sophisticated models on the market, I&#x27;m not sure why the average person would need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to take it apart now and then to de-gunk the crevices where water and saliva seep in and allow icky stuff to grow (an issue with my older Sonicare toothbrush as well) but that, and periodic replacement of the head will keep this product usable for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product and its predecessor so much that I&#x27;ve purchased others and given them as gifts, and my dental hygienist remarked that I had less plaque and tartar buildup on my last visit to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that replacement heads are rather pricey, but that seems to be the case with most electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush. I&#x27;m glad they included a travel case, but this model does not have the LED power indicator. I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li> Great on my teeth and in just a week my teeth were so white. Has 31,000 strokes per minute and has a timer set for 2 minutes. My daughter, husband, and son loves it. It is so powerful and feels great on your teeth</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning teeth.  This is 2nd one for me, other 1 lasted over 5 years!</li>
            <li> We got this as a two pac and are very pleased with the product, performance and price. Reliable company if you have any issues. We prefer battery operated for simplicity worldwide. Batteries last a long time and can be used for LED flashlights after spent in this unit. It&#x27;s important to let the unit do the work as you move it about your mouth. Otherwise you may do damage to your gums.</li>
            <li> To date Philips Sonicare means Quality. I gets my money worth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 5 monhts ago and it now won&#x27;t keep a charge so I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation, seems to last a long time on a charge, and my teeth are quite noticeably cleaner than from using a manual toothbrush.  A lot less clunky than the cheap battery powered electric I was using.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this product.  I would not like to be without it!</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with nasty, gunky water and mold inside my toothbrush.  It gave me a bacterial infection in my gums back in December 2014.  I am now on my second round of anti-biotics (February 2015).  My gums are in bad shape and some have eroided away from my teeth creating pockets which keep getting infected.  Buyer beware on this tooth brush.  You must check it every day to clean it out so you don&#x27;t get a build up of water on the inside.</li>
            <li> This model is a great value!</li>
            <li> Cost was very good but I didn&#x27;t know the 30 sec timer was not on this unit. I have other sonicare units and they all had this feature. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a family member for Christmas and he loves it!  He says sincerely that it was the best christmas present he has ever received!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an AMAZING deal on it for $20!!!  Retail is $70!  ($29.95 with a clip it now $10 off coupon)</li>
            <li> Used to own a sonicare and loved it. Was startled to find one at such a low price. I don&#x27;t use it for regular brushing, but intensive focus treatment 2x a week on localized points. I scrape between my teeth with one of those metal tooth picks in a couple of my problem areas, then set the sonicare in that spot (quite lightly, mainly using the sonic action) for a few cycles. I know this sounds odd, but for someone who is homeless (such as myself), this is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34;. The charge lasts a very long time using it in this manner, so you don&#x27;t have to find a plugin often, the unit is lightweight, and the results are truly worthwhile for your dental health. Plus, dang, the mouth feels good :D</li>
            <li> Took some time to get used to it.  Teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member after her &amp;#34;Roto-Dent&amp;#34; stopped working... as I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years...with no issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son. My husband and I have used a Sonicare for years and love ours. If we do not take it on a trip, we can&#x27;t wait to brush with it when we get back. So when my son (who needs motivation to brush regularly) asked for one, I hesitantly said &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; because of the cost. Well, after the first use, he noticed a difference on how clean his teeth feel and he loves it. So, now I am ordering another one for my 20 year old. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> gave it as a Christmas gift and they love it also.  a win win gift!  great price, good product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I like just about everything dealing with this product. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, it holds a charge well, and I&#x27;ve felt a difference in my oral health-as advertised. My only negative comment is the smaller brush head. I have a large mouth with horse teeth, and it just feels different from the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve utilized in the past. Fantastic tho. Buy it.</li>
            <li> there are too many great things about this product...i love it....never knew my teeth could feel so clean..</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.  Every time I use it, it feels like I went to the dentist.  I regret not buying this sooner.  Cannot beat that price either.  Awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one sooner. Love the way this works. If I had to do over, I would buy the slimmer version. Works awesome!</li>
            <li> You get a great toothbrush for the price.  It is much better than the cheap batter AA powered ones.  But it cleans as good as the more expensive toothbrushes.  It is also easy to charge with the charging base.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the 2 minute timer on it. It did take a longer than expected time to charge the first time but have not had problems with charging since.</li>
            <li> It works as an electric toothbrush, but the sheer amount of mold that starts growing in all the crevices is absolutely disgusting. I tried opening it to dry it out each time I used it, but the mold just kept coming back. Now when I use the toothbrush I can smell the mold. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel so clean when I know that there&#x27;s a thick layer of mold growing in my toothbrush. They really need to add an o-ring or something to keep this watertight.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dental hygienist. I was able to find it here for a lower price compared to my dentist&#x27;s office. The tooth brush arrived just on time, inside original packaging. For those who have used spin brush like me will feel a difference of day and night. Philips Sonicare makes less noise and is much lighter compared to spin brush. It came with a beautiful travel bag that I plan to use.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, I have to say I am not terribly impressed. This is my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush, but I have used many different electric toothbrushes over the years. The first thing I noticed was that if your teeth accidentally touch the back of the brush while it is on, it makes an uncomfortable and ear-rattling buzz. Not fun first thing in the morning pre-coffee. The brush head is also very small, so it is more difficult to get all-over coverage. Using the brush with toothpaste is another challenge. If you turn the brush on with paste before putting it in your moutg, it will vibrate right off! If you dont turn off the brush before taking it out, it will turn your bathroom mirror into a minty-fresh Jackson Pollock painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it seems like my teeth should be cleaner, but often they still seem filmy even after a long brushing. I&#x27;m giving it another 2 weeks before I go back to my trusty $7 generic electric</li>
            <li> works well, charge around once a week! and this type is not very expensive. could not be used under 220Volt</li>
            <li> I started using this product 10 years ago when my dentist recommend.  Has greatly improved my checkups.</li>
            <li> Happy with this toothbrush, replacing my last one which lasted about 10 years. Good price, only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have the automatic 30 second notification like my other one. It just runs 2 minutes straight thru. That may be why it was less expensive, and I may just not have caught that in the description when I ordered. Overall tho&#x27; happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, holds a charge for a good while, good for weekend trips especially, and don&#x27;t need to lug the charger.</li>
            <li> I had gotten used to my previous Sonicare that indicated when it was time to move on to another quadrant of your mouth while brushing.  I thought that was a feature of all Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes.  I miss it but I am getting used to not having it.  When this one needs to be replaced, I will make sure that this feature is part of that one.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Keeps my honest about how long I spend brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes in the early &#x27;90s and loved it. So, when the battery died recently (nearly 20 years later), I definitely wanted to purchase another Sonicare. I chose the Essence because I had extra brush heads that fit and I really don&#x27;t care about all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; on the more expensive models. The new brush is great. The only thing I miss is the 20 to 30 second &amp;#34;advance&amp;#34; for each quadrant like the old model. I think I&#x27;m probably brushing each quadrant longer now, so that&#x27;s a good thing! Other reviewers have mentioned that water collects, and eventually mold develops, in the area between the brush head and the charger. It does collect there just like in the old model but I just clean and dry it once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed mold developing. I think the mold takes a while to develop, so routinely cleaning it will solve that problem.</li>
            <li> We used to use a spinbrush.  No contest.  The sonic is a great brush.</li>
            <li> Good product! I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months, and feel good.</li>
            <li> the noise it makes are a bit too loud, otherwise the item is good for clearing my teeth, better then my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for our son and he said it works great.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic buzz was pretty odd at first, but it gets our teeth smooth like when you get them cleaned at the dentist. Traveled with it for a week and it had plenty of charge.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is too big for female hand, the way it vibrate is very annoying, its too strong, and you actually can&#x27;t brush your teeth with your mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you look at other more durable brands..</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for many years.  After nine years my last one died and I needed a new one.  This one was closest to the model I had and was the most reasonable price.  It came very quickly and was exactly as it was represented.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandson.  It was what he asked for for his birthday and he is extremely happy with it. My husband and I have used these for the last 2 years and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s like going to the dentist every day. My teeth are so clean and I feel like they might even look whiter. I use baking soda with mine. Less toxic than toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. This is the 2nd one i have had to purchase in 13 years.. After using this an ordinary one will not do</li>
            <li> Had one before and bought one again......need I say more</li>
            <li> My teeth feel alot cleaner using this toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think it helps with whitening though. I think the timer should go a little longer also.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend inspired me to buy a Sonicare toothbrush and boy was I glad he did! I&#x27;ve really noticed how clean my teeth are after using it and love the 2min timer feature. Makes brushing my teeth easy!</li>
            <li> I love the 2 minute timer; my teeth and gums feel truly clean.  Great gift to myself for Christmas and years to come.</li>
            <li> Love this great price and we needed a more compact size for traveling The handel and the brush same size but the charger was smaller.</li>
            <li> This is the latest version of the original Sonicare design, where each replacement of the brush head comes with a new set of magnets. It&#x27;s easy to see how the power of the brushing improves when you put on a new head. The fresh magnets are as important as the fresh bristles. The alternating magnetic field that vibrates the brush also slowly weakens the magnets. Getting fresh magnets with each head keeps the unit working like new,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complaining about this brush head design don&#x27;t appreciate how it is required to maintain the brush performance. It&#x27;s a feature, not a bug. I&#x27;m glad Sonicare has kept this basic design available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing out the brush and handle assembly after each use isn&#x27;t all that burdensome, either: it takes less than 30 seconds, and is easily done as you give the unit the same kind of rinse you would give any toothbrush after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this design is relatively cheap and easy to use while being highly effective. It has been a good replacement for my original Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleans well and is easy to use. My teeth feel cleaner than before and my gums appear to be healthier, too. It needs to be recharged more frequently than every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a week but love how clean teeth feel, really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy for family member</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than any other electric toothbrush that I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used at least three other models.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush and the price and shipping were more than reasonable! I replaced an old one that I had for years. It was cheaper to get a whole new ensemble than to replace the base that died.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is defective; we are returning it. The head vibrates too loudly. We own 2 of them so we know they are good toothbrushes. But this one is not.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. I bought this because it was supposed to work with my other sonicare&#x27;s brush heads (I had two replacements leftover). But it didn&#x27;t. :( But I kept anyway. I wish it had the 30 second timer that my old one had, letting you know to switch quadrants. But this is fine. My teeth feel plenty clean after use.</li>
            <li> I have had the battery version and this one is just as good and no batteries</li>
            <li> My teeth feel the cleanest they&#x27;ve ever felt just like after a visit to the dentist for a cleaning! Awesome quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is pretty much the entry unit into the Sonicare line of products.  However, it still has the automatic two minute timer and vibrates at 35000 per minute.  This has done a fantatic job keeping my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> my hygienist said i had some abrasion on my teeth and that it was probably caused form too much pressure with the toothbrush, so she suggested to try a cheap electric tooth brush to see if i could get used to to it and, if so, to buy a one-hundred-dollar one. So i tried this and i just love it. It may not be the highest end tooth brush, but i don&#x27;t think it is the cheapest one either. It last a lot, way more that two weeks, and I like that it goes off automatically after two minutes, so you know that you&#x27;ve done your job. Not sure i will buy another one till this works!</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for a little over one month. Past the 30 day return policy. The charging light  stays on all the time. It just started doing this.&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if it eventually will burn up or short out and I will have to replace it with a new one. Only time will tell I guess. The brush works very well otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use a Sonicare toothbrush again! This is a great product to keep your teeth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Greatest addition in years to the manicure department. Have been brushing with the sonicare for a month and can see a 3-4 shade difference in color of my teeth. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for 6 month and have found it to be very poorly designed. Water get trapped between the brush head and body allowing for bacteria and a horrible odor to developers. The batter now does not hold a charge after. I have never been happy with this product and now find its useless. I wish I&#x27;d never bought it!</li>
            <li> There is a huge design flaw with this model. When you twist off the replaceable toothbrush part (the whole white base of the toothbrush comes off) and inside it&#x27;s hollow and it&#x27;s not sealed. Water, toothpaste and any other liquids from your mouth goes inside and molds. Even with daily cleaning there is black slimy bold inside. It&#x27;s quiet disgusting and now we&#x27;re looking for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The seller did not state that this Soniccare product was an old version (maybe the 1st generation) which requires much more expensive replacement heads.  For the price, I could have purchased the latest version.</li>
            <li> It seems like at least half of the reviews here are from folks in the exact same boat we were in.... owned one of these Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush sets for the last 10 year, and it finally stopped holding a charge.  Instead of trying to replace its battery, just figured we&#x27;d go for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, we initially purchased a Sonicare unit because our dentist recommended it, but we stayed with it because the thing just does a great job cleaning teeth. The soft-grip handle adds a very nice touch, and the two minute timer works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the new unit lasts as long as our first one did; if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be back here to update the review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a simple, easy to use rechargeable electric toothbrush then we recommended giving this one a try. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I had the first brush forever and when it finally bit the dust I didn&#x27;t think twice, I ordered and another.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third Sonicare electric toothbrush.  I just wear them out.  This is the newest model which would fit my needs.  My dentist recommends this kind of brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It was my very first electric toothbrush and I have definitely noticed a change in my dental health after I started using this one. I love how long the battery lasts on this product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this present from my sister and although I was expecting so much more, I realized that this tooth brush was a gateway towards a better future that includes better hygiene and girl friends (without the space- because that implies they are my girlfriends). So yeah, this was an okay Christmas gift. Just okay. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t spectacular either. It was something that you got as a child from your dentist or your Grandmother after finding out you have  3 or more cavities. I am disappointed. But it&#x27;s okay, because i&#x27;ll have white teeth- which is pretty cool, I guess. I am fully satisfied with this gift(kinda).</li>
            <li> I have an older sonicare that I like very much. The battery on that one doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to (about a week.) I still use that one every morning, but I needed one for my other bathroom. (I get ready in the morning on another floor because that is where my closet is--at bedtime I don&#x27;t always want to walk up an extra floor to brush my teeth! :D)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY like this one better. The neck of it is thinner, which makes it more comfortable to hit your back teeth. The head itself is also a little smaller which helps it fit and turn more easily. I do like the \\&quot;quad\\&quot; counter my old one had, I like knowing that I brushed long enough. I suppose it is arbitrary really, but I like the little pause in buzzing to know when to move to another quadrant! I am simple that way! ha ha!! Luckily, since I have been using that one for years, I sort of know the pattern and how long to park on each tooth. I especially like that this one is much more packable. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider taking my old one, it is almost as big as my curling iron! This one fits nicely into its INCLUDED case. Very thoughtful design. I don&#x27;t travel with the battery charger as mine lasts about a month. I am the only one using it, so I can&#x27;t attest to the life of the battery with multiple users. This and a water pic have REALLY improved the health of my gums. My dentist is happy! :D</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!your teeth feel clean....like you just got out of dentist office!! I am going to buy another one for my son!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over 13 years, and it finally quit working. Hope this one lasts just as long, because I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Sonicare has always been a quality product for me. I have been cavity free and had whiter teeth for years using it. My whole family uses the Essence. To me this brush is just as good as the Elite line of the more expensive Sonicare brushes. I saw this at Target for $40 and Amazon had a better deal with free shipping</li>
            <li> I have never owned a high-power electric toothbrush but let me tell you this thing is powerful. My teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just come from the dentist every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two beeps that start the timer are almost inaudible unless you&#x27;re really listening closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great toothbrush for the price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love how my mouth feels after using the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a year and then broke it by getting water into the handle...my fault not a manufacturing issue. I immediately hopped on amazon and ordered another. I might eventually buy one of the more high end models of sonicare but i find that this model is reliable and does a wonderful job of thoroughly cleaning my teeth. One of the things i noticed after using this brush was that my breath actually improved even though i wasn&#x27;t brushing anymore frequently. couldn&#x27;t ask for a more solid product.</li>
            <li> It took a few times using it before my teeth got used to the vibrations but now I love it! No urge to go back to using a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I am replacing one sonicare tooth brush with another sonicare tooth brush.  This is ridiculous that I have to type a minimum number of words to say what I have to in maybe 6 or7!!</li>
            <li> It is a great price.  The only trouble is the replacement heads are as expensive as a new unit... What!</li>
            <li> Much better than I thought it would be, great for the price!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned a round-headed unit for years and love it. This was recommended by my dentist, but it splatters all over, which is totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. I little loud but not a big deal. The price on amazon when it had the clip coupon was great.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Noticed a huge difference, would never go back to my regular toothbrush again! The dentist noticed a difference, too.</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush that helps you keep your teeth clean... on a timer to make sure that you get into all the nooks and crannies in your mouth. My dentists recommended this one for me</li>
            <li> This has been a great toothbrush for me. I really liked how it gradually led you up to the full setting. It took some getting used to for me, but it in the end, it&#x27;s been great. Totally makes my teeth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Product never disappoints</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it. It was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It really makes your teeth feel clean. gets rid of plaque build up.</li>
            <li> From reading all the other reviews it was clear that the inside would have to be cleaned regularly. It does the job, and if you maintain it there should be no problem.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare!  My old one finally died after years of daily use.  Retail stores wanted $100+ for this toothbrush.  I originally planned to purchase just a replacement handle, but saw this complete package with a travel pouch, brush head and charger for under $50 and then discovered a $10 discount code and that sealed the deal.  A replacement handle is in the $25-$30 range.  What a bargin.  I let it charge for about 36 hours before using it and the charge lasted for at least a week.  It arrived on time and was wrapped in Sonicare packaging.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush. Brushes clean like you just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothbrush. It vibrates at such a high frequency. It actually starts out at a lower frequency and after around 12 days (I am guessing 2 X 2minute sessions &#x3D; 1 day) it increases the frequency giving your gums a chance to acclimate to it. This is a smart toothbrush. I swear my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and every use. It does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes the best electric toothbrushes hands down.  The Essence is simply the best Sonicare toothbrush you can get for its price.</li>
            <li> Great price; have used Sonicare many years.  2nd purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Robert Zemnick</li>
            <li> A good solid toothbrush, my second one.  However, this one does not have the 60 second interval timer that my original one had.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush. The battery life is great and it isnt super loud. After seeing mine my girlfriend is thinking about getting her one.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace m old Sonicare and for the money this was the best. A newer model did&#x27;t perform that much better according to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after repeated requests by my doctor to &amp;#34;go electric&amp;#34; and using so many darn muscles to scrub my teeth with a boring old passive-bristle toothbrush. Out of guilt, I went online hours before i was scheduled to see my dentist, and hastily purchased the best-rated toothbrush with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, did I luck out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush gives you a dentist-clean feel after EVERY brush. EVERY BRUSH! I went from brushing my teeth once, maybe twice a day (if I felt up to it) to brushing three times a day, after meals, after showers, after getting the mail... pretty much just for the heck of it! My brushing time has increased from an average of 37.3 seconds to well over 90 seconds because I can just FEEL my teeth getting cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, the bristle action is firm but not painful. The battery lasts about ten days without a charge. The brush comes apart and fits easily into the pictured carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one that had eventually died. My dental checkups have never been better since I started using Philips Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this toothbrush at all. It hardly works and I&#x27;m getting another one that actually works. Useless brush.</li>
            <li> I Love this toothbrush. At first I had to learn to use it, i kept turning it wrong, trying to use it as a regular brush. Though it works very similar, because it has the sonic vibrations you dont need to press or such. It leaves my teeth so clean I feel as if I just had them clean! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Just in one month!! This electronic toothbrush is cheaper 10$!!! And without price matching!!! I bought two !!!! What are they doing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a professional cleaning every day. My periodontist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are brushed more thoroughly, and gum doesn&#x27;t get hurt in the process. No more bleeding gum while brushing teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush about a month and am quite disappointed with it.  My old Phillips Sonicare Elite toothbrush lasted several years and I liked it very much.  Towards the end it seemed to slow down and needed cleaning more frequently as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulated inside.  This toothbrush is quite good after cleaning for a day or two but then slows down as &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; accumulates inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel I needed a &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; toothbrush and ordered this brush because it was recommended as the best electric toothbrush under $50.  I now wish I had purchased a &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora</li>
            <li> My husband bought one of these and talked me into buying one of my own.  I was surprised at how clean my teeth felt afterward.  Now I will have to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning, but I bet he will like the effects as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush replaced another Philips toothbrush we had had for over 5 years.  The old one was still working but how long was doubtful.  The new one is working well and we look forward to years of service from it.</li>
            <li> Been using for several weeks.  Now it is up to full speed (after the first 12 uses).  Feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job.  Will know more with my next check-up and cleaning scheduled for next month.</li>
            <li> Ok so I brought this toothbrush as my first electric toothbrush based solely off of all the great reviews on Amazon and Im happy to say that the toothbrush has lived up to its hype so far :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing after using this even once. My teeth have never felt so clean. Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Works great. Only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second interval option.</li>
            <li> So much better than the cheap models you get in the food store. Use this, and you&#x27;ll feel like you just left a hygienist.</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job in cleaning teeth. Not too noisy or vibrating. Wish it came with 2 brushes in case one gets too soft. Add a replacement at an up charge, please.</li>
            <li> After two years of using this, I&#x27;ve had two visits to the dentist. Both consisted of a short teeth cleaning and a pat on the back. After years of dental issues and thousands of dollars, this is a toothbrush I swear by!</li>
            <li> As someone with puffy and sensitive gums (despite religious brushing and flossing), decalcification, some serious sensitivity, and an average of 3-4 cavities per dentist trip - I was desperate for something better for my oral health (especially since recently being diagnosed with a heart valve problem). I debated on this tooth brush for several months, but finally decided when Amazon had a coupon for an additional $10 off it was time to purchase this $80 toothbrush for $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this tooth brush for 3 days, but have already noticed a slight decrease in the sensitivity I was experiencing (even with the regular brush that comes standard in the package). I also noticed immediately that this brush gives that dentist clean feeling.  Honestly, I already regret not buying this brush sooner.  I wonder how many cavities could have been prevented if I had jumped on this sooner.  I can&#x27;t say my gums look drastically different just yet, however, I can say flossing is somewhat less painful even in the first few days of using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the features offered in the higher models (e.g., the quad pacer) would be nice, for me (a broke graduate student) this brush more than fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Wish the charge would last a  little longer, but overall really nice - love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Good friendly use electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I noticed my veneers haven&#x27;t been looking as great as when I got them a few years ago. Within a few weeks a noticed a big difference in the area where my veneers meet my gum line as well as the color and the results continue to improve. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very impressed!  Same quality Sonicare product I&#x27;m used to buying!  Highly recommend this toothbrush.  Simple and gets the job done!  My dental hygienist suggested it and got a deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush first give $10 discount is to force, if 3 preferential $10 each that is perfect，I hope can be balanced in the future</li>
            <li> This is all you need in an electric toothbrush.  There are more expensive versions, but I think it is just a waste of money.  The battery life per charge is great.  It gives your teeth a great cleaning, and makes trips to the dentist that much better.  This is my second one.  My first one lasted about 5-6 years before it stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and easy to use. Small head is quite flexible in the mounth. Usually when I brush my teeth manually, I will finish soon, but electric one can make sure brushing 2 minutes. Compared to other products, I feel like this price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  People complain about the inside getting gross, but that&#x27;s because they themselves are gross and don&#x27;t clean it.  Here&#x27;s the cleaning ritual I have after every brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  unscrew the top&lt;br /&gt;2.  rinse the handle&lt;br /&gt;3.  place handle on base&lt;br /&gt;4.  pop off the brush&lt;br /&gt;5.  rinse the screwy thing and the brush&lt;br /&gt;6.  pop brush back into the screwy thing&lt;br /&gt;7.  place the brush onto the handle (don&#x27;t screw it back on, just place it on top) such that it&#x27;s tilted, allowing the insides to air out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole process takes like 12 seconds and costs about a tenth of a calorie, so don&#x27;t even worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing people complain about is that this brush doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds or whatever, but that&#x27;s also a non-issue.  You&#x27;re unable to brush your teeth if you don&#x27;t know whether 30 seconds have passed?  I don&#x27;t think so.  I think you CAN do it.  Just believe in yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid, very straightforward, and gets the job done.  My last dentist visit was significantly better than when I was using a regular brush (of course, YMMV depending on your oral hygiene).  It&#x27;s hard to imagine needing another electric brush.  It&#x27;s also good for traveling; for trips shorter than 2 weeks, you don&#x27;t even need the base, because the battery lasts about 2 weeks.  Lastly, if you have sensitive teeth, you can buy sensitive replacement head assembly thingies (whatever they&#x27;re called), which I&#x27;ve been using for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!!  comes with a charger and a carry bag for vacations or overnight.</li>
            <li> This is the more simple one speed sonicare.  The little case is really handy because I travel a lot.  The battery lasts great so it is good to go.  What can you say?  It does the job well.</li>
            <li> Does its job well. good for the price.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this item.</li>
            <li> Amazon and Philips do a poor job of describing the features on the various models of their electric toothbrush.  I was replacing my old Philips electric toothbrush where the battery had finally died (a distinct shortcoming of this toothbrush is that one can not replace the battery).  I was expecting at least the same features as my old toothbrush but am very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t provide me with the 30 second interval notice and does not indicate the level of charge.  You only find that out when it stops working.  I definitely would be happy to have paid a bit more to get those features.</li>
            <li> I love the item.  It is great especially for traveling.  The charge lasts a long time.  I probably won&#x27;t have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare that alerts you @ 30 second intervals.  This particular model only has a 2 minute timer, a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great buy and as a replacemnet for an older one that I was very happy with I am expecting the same from this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this based on my use of my previous one, which died. I thought I could get away with using a spin brush or something else &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. However, I find the timer essential for good brushing habits and, in my opinion, this gets your teeth cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at switching to Oral B; the only reason I didn&#x27;t is that I have a brush head that fits it on hand and didn&#x27;t want to throw/give it away.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It has a timer where it shuts off after 2 minutes has gone by so it&#x27;s easy to keep track how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth. The charger works well but takes up a decent amount of counter space.</li>
            <li> This is an old model and does not have many features.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare Toothbrush. The first one lasted nineteen years. No serious dental problems. These brushes save you money on dental bills provided you follow the use instruction and brush daily</li>
            <li> great entry level sonic e-series toothbrush. It gets teeth really clean in a way that only a dental visit can surpass. It is a littlle unnerving when first being used, but once you are accustomed to it, it is OK.</li>
            <li> Personal Phillips Sonicare Essence powered toothbrush is a winner.  I have used it for years and it is the best on the market.  Long lasting lithium battery goes for years.  Easy to take apart ans to clean.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I had one before.  It works great!  I will always stick with Sonicare.  Have had good check up results since I began using it.</li>
            <li> It is really worked out</li>
            <li> So good to replace my old Sonicare. The quality has remained and a product a expect to receive once again a very good amount of time in use of...</li>
            <li> I used to think that oral-b was a far superior toothbrush until I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 4 times less expensive than the oral-b I was using, but does a much better job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I can&#x27;t wait to brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I use to use a battery powered toothbrush which was ok. But not that I&#x27;ve used this I definitely won&#x27;t be going back. Amazon offers a great price a long with a 10 dollar coupon. The first time using the toothbrush it slowly works its way up in intensity for the first 12 uses before going to full power. Cleans very well and will be using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> It is helpful for cleaning my teeth, and also it is very comfortable to use. Also the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best tooth brush I have ever used! After brushing my teeth actually feel like they do after a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush while it lasts but it gets only 3 stars because it DOESN&#x27;T last. I bought six replacement heads for the last one and it failed after I used three.  I bought another Sonicare as the price had dropped a lot -- and because I wanted to use the remaining three replacement heads.  I may try something else next time.  It USED TO BE excellent and lasted a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Product Broke after 3 months of usage</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love these.  Will never own a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I purchased 1 each for my husband and son and they love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> i received the tool yesterday, and try it,it&#x27;s good for my need. i love it, and if it can more cheaper, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have always taken good care of my teeth, but this toothbrush made my teeth feel like I had just left the dentist.  My husband and I share it, we just unscrew the head and put ours on when we use it.  The only downfall is that the replacement heads are kind of expensive and it seems like I will be replacing the heads every 2-3 months.  Shipped on time, would buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of these before and they all worked well. They seem to last 2-3 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Chose this as a duplicate/replacement for an identical one. It&#x27;s a fine toothbrush...works best when you apply toothpaste, put in your mouth and turn on. Don&#x27;t forget to flush...er, I mean, floss!</li>
            <li> Of course, dentists love Sonicare. This is the easiest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, comes apart to make a nice compact little package for traveling.  It stays charged for two weeks that I know of, and even the charger is small enough to carry if you&#x27;re going to be gone longer than that.  Purchase of the original set is very cost-effective, but the cost of additional brush heads when you need to change them (you DO change your toothbrush regularly, yes?!) is pretty darned expensive.  Nevertheless, I like it and I hope it lasts for years.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is one of the recommended things I would tell someone to buy concerning hygiene. It&#x27;s kept me cavity-free for 18 years, and is continuing to do so! Also, the handle has a timer, so once it stops, you&#x27;re done. There are many features that come along with it and a warranty, so I highly recommend this product. (I&#x27;m harsh with stars, I rarely give 5s, so don&#x27;t fret).</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is very loud and sensitive and takes a while to get used too</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price for a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> My dentist has been bugging me to get this for a couple of years.  Does a great job and after just a few days, previous problems with bleeding gums are gone completely!</li>
            <li> the noise is VERY loud</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Much better than the Oral B old one I had. Cleans really well. I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is the second Phillips Sonicare I have owned.  When the first one finally stopped working (it worked for years) I tried a different electronic toothbrush and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  That convinced me to go back to Sonicare.  I was happy with the price.  It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used it once.It is powerful.I think I have to be used to it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> I chose to replace my Sonicare Essence 5600 with a new one.  My old one lasted close to 10 years before breaking down. I was very pleased with the performance and price of this particular model. I also found that replacement brushes were quite reasonably-priced and available at Costco.  Other models cost more, but don&#x27;t declare a higher performance, just a different style.</li>
            <li> Aint no teeth as dope as mine theyre just so fresh so clean (so fresh and so clean clean)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go back to manual now that I&#x27;ve gotten use to it.  Don&#x27;t feel like I can get my teeth clean without it.  Had not used an electric before and took a while - long while - to get used to.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> Love it! I forces you to get an amazing clean throughout your entire mouth every single teeth get squeaky Clean! I have seen an incredible change in my teeth more whiter and all tarnish is gone is three weeks!! I am planning in purchasing one for each of my kids! The price was just right, this tooth brush is an investment, less trips to the dentist office. I will highly recommended, specially if you have kids, because it really will forced them to keep the toothbrush in their mouth until it turns off!!!</li>
            <li> Old sonicare finally dies afte about 12 years so time for replacement.  Since I alredya had soem new heads I wanted a new one that would fit those heads.  Perfect replacement and great price.</li>
            <li> noisey little thing. replaced an original sonicare brush from ~2003. this one is much louder than the original.</li>
            <li> I had never used a toothbrush like this before.  My hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare and said it was the best one.  Now that I have it, I realize that my teeth look and feel cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  It is just great and I shall continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very fine product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare toothbrush about 5 years ago but got away from it because the replacement heads cost too much. This time I thought I would buy the tooth brush and a set of replacements so I will be good for at least a year. The toothbrush is much more powerful zing to it than I remember. It vibrates your noggin quite a bit but I like the sensation on my gums. The main problem I have with this is that water/spit gets between the brush and the base where it screws on. I have to unscrew it and rinse it out and let it air dry every time I use the tooth brush. Very inconvenient. I tried screwing it on different way and making sure it is tight etc but still the same problem. Quite a bit goes in, enough to &amp;#34;pour&amp;#34; out at the end of the brushing. So it can be disgusting if you don&#x27;t know about it and leave the tooth brush screwed on.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations and was considerably cheaper online. Particularly like the carrying case as we travel quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for many, many years.  We purchased a Sonicare for each member of our family.&lt;br /&gt;We all love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wierd sensation at first and can be tricky in terms of learning how to use the right kind of pressure. Those with very sensitive teeth might give this a pass as it does create a good deal of vibration and it will become very apparent when using the brush on your front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It however does it&#x27;s job quite well.  My stained teeth has lightened up significantly, certainly nothing close to that of a trip to the dentist but still better than what you could do with manual brushing.  I&#x27;d like to mention what a Dental Hygenist told me: Be careful NOT to overuse the brush as overuse can take its toll on your tooth&#x27;s enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy for the price. My teeth really feels thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> Product came in earlier than I expected. Great job. We really like this.</li>
            <li> Received it in the time it was promised.  Bought to replace my husbands older one that broke and that is all he will use.  He really likes to use the Sonic toothbrush and so do I. I have one too and they are a great toothbrush to have.  Would very highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a second Sonicare Toothbrush for my second location. It is perfect for the price and came with a 2 year warranty. I would recommend it to anyone. Once you go Sonicare you can&#x27;t go back. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift at a great price.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a regular toothbrush after owning a Sonicare for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> My son has been wanting to try this product for a while so I bought it and he loves it definitely recommend this for anyone at any age</li>
            <li> I like it much better than my very old previous Sonicare brush. This one would be even better if it had the 30 second beep while brushing.</li>
            <li> The action of the toothbrush itself is great.  My teeth feel so clean and refreshed after brushing.  However, the design is incredibly horrible.  One cannot just simply brush teeth, rinse brush, and put it back in the charger (in its entirety).  One must take the brush apart, rinse both parts thoroughly, and return only the base/handle to the charger.  Keeping the brush barrel attached to the handle sets up a damp environment in which mold begins to grow very quickly.  Even with the above precaution of dismantling the brush after each use, one must actually clean both open parts with a q-tip about once a week to be sure there isn&#x27;t a speck of mold lurking in the mechanism. Surely a company like Philips could come up with a better design.  In addition, the replacement brush heads are incredibly expensive -- almost double the amount I&#x27;ve paid for Oral-B replacement brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> It is so good and the price is unbeatable, I love it so much! I strongly recommend this prodcut to others.</li>
            <li> Good brush for those price</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but after using for a couple of months it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I owner a Oral B electric toothbrush prior to this one.  The battery was noticeably weaker after less than a yr of daily use.  It would not hold a charge for more than maybe 2 days of brushing, and even when fully charged it was much weaker than when first purchased.  This toothbrush does NOT have that problem.  I&#x27;ve had one for over a year and just bought another for my wife.  It holds a charge for days and leaves your teeth feeling incredibly clean.  It&#x27;s got a larger handle and maybe isn&#x27;t as ergonomic as some others, but I&#x27;m guessing maybe that is to house a larger/better battery (I haven&#x27;t taken it apart to see but I&#x27;m thinking that based on the difference in performance)</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner! If you&#x27;re looking for a deep clean without breaking the bank, this is the brush for you! Just be aware, the neck is very delicate, so be careful when traveling :)</li>
            <li> I use to think electronic tooth brushes were for dweebs but holy moly do my teeth feel clean. Say good-bye to gingivitis and bad breath and say hello to happiness and success. I recently bought this along with some sheets and I must say I am a lot happier about the toothbrush. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The basic model does exactly what it is supposed to do. It has a 2 minute timer and will shut off when the &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; brushing time is reached, but you can always turn it back on if you need extra brushing. For the first week of two it does feel like you just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;After using this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model I don&#x27;t really see any need for the additional features offered on the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the blister pack it came in had a spot for and extra brush head, but is was empty.....Come on Philips! you could have tossed in the brush head.</li>
            <li> ordered by mistake and had to return.  i prefer the newer style heads</li>
            <li> You dont have to keep it on a charger long. It stays charged for ever.love it.</li>
            <li> Really great value. I&#x27;m not sure why people spend $100+ for all the fancy extras. This brush does a great job, my mouth feels clean and my teeth could tell the difference on the first day from my old, non-Sonicare brush. Holds a charge for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh the price was a steal for this on &#x27;group on&#x27;.  We have used these for years and have given to each one of our grown children.  They all have them for their own children now and use it regularly.  Our dentist confirms he can always tell when patients use these sonic brushes.  A perfect gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> It works well. I love it!</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!! Just got back from my semi-annual dental checkup. First let me start with I take great pride in my teeth. Always have gone above and beyond to keep them healthy. The second I sat down the hygienist knew I switched brushes. There was buildup I&#x27;ve never had before. She said &amp;#34;why did you do this and why did t you aske first?&amp;#34; She went on to say you need mechanical movement to scrub away plaque and bacteria from your teeth. This brush just vibrates and nothing moves. The &amp;#34;ultrasonic&amp;#34; movement didn&#x27;t do what Phillips indicated it would. Big time two thumbs down! 👎🏻👎🏻</li>
            <li> I just got this, and the unit works well, as expected based on the reviews that I read.  Unfortunately, I only read the reviews on the whole unit, and didn&#x27;t think to read those about the replacement toothbrush heads themselves.  Phillips designed it so that you have to replace about half of the whole unit, and they charge you accordingly.  It&#x27;s kind of like buying a computer printer for next to nothing, and then having to spend a fortune on the ink cartridges.  Yes, there are some &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brushes without the head that you can buy, but the reviews seem to indicate that it&#x27;s next to impossible to get the original one off to install the replacement, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying those.  If I had known this, I might have gone with a different brand.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works great!</li>
            <li> We really love this product, our teeth cleaning life change since the day we got this, amazing speed, quality and the sensation in your mouth is incredible....great for Philips!</li>
            <li> Works great, feels great on my gums, and cleans so well! Needs a good 24- hours to charge before ready to use.</li>
            <li> The design and incorporated features of this product are outstanding and is without a doubt the best product of it&#x27;s type I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dental Hygienist and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending this for ever, finally got one and WOW after a few months of use my teeth feel like I left with a cleaning, and way cheaper than Wally World.</li>
            <li> Great product, can&#x27;t imagine ever brushing my teeth without one again.</li>
            <li> Very impressed so far with the Sonicare. I&#x27;ve tried several electric toothbrushes, and this one beats them all, hands down. Holds a charge, and cleans the teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love the power on this. It&#x27;s vigorous and gentle. Love how it turns off after 2 minutes so I don&#x27;t overdo it. It came in the mail quickly. So far, no problems. My &amp;#34;natural biological&amp;#34; dentist recommended it. Yes, I&#x27;d say buy it. It is not expensive, especially if it can help save your teeth</li>
            <li> I replaced the same toothbrush, as the older one no longer held a charge.  My dentist is happy and Im happy.</li>
            <li> for the $13.00 price it was great.  but not worth the regular price on it</li>
            <li> Love the head and head action, but messy mildrew clean up. The poor design allows water and saliva to run down inside the head and battery. You have to remove the head and clean contantly, otherwise you have nasty mildew mess inside there.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> Works great. My dental hygienist is pleased as well.</li>
            <li> Cheapest you can find and it works well. I don&#x27;t think the functions on the $200 one are as useful as described. Highly recommend if you dont want to waste money on expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This was a replace toothbrush and have been using this product for years. Didn&#x27;t get all the bells and whistles this time but don&#x27;t really miss them. Very satisfied and hope this one lasts as long as the last one which was around 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush for the money</li>
            <li> The charger on my Sonicare Essence toothbrush went out and I could only find replacement toothbrushes at the stores.  I could have purchased just the charger, but for just a little extra money I was able to buy an entire new electric toothbrush unit.  It works great and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.  I had extra brush heads for my old Sonicare, so it was important to me to purchase a new unit that would use the same brush head.</li>
            <li> I have to say my last Sonicare lasted over 10 years, and I have no idea how. Finally bought a new one and I have to say my teeth have been in their best shape since using Sonicare. It really is better than a toothbrush and the dentist visits prove it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had on of these electric brushes before and it lasted for over a year. I will try and see if this one last longer</li>
            <li> Works well, feels well-balanced in hand, and easy care product.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best value out of all of the powered tooth brushes.  Simple and effective.  The base unit tends to last about 4 or 5 years, but should be cleaned very regularly.  Of course, the brush heads should be replaced more often.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has everything right except for the part that it gets so much mold. It&#x27;s pretty much like a snowmobile that isn&#x27;t particularly designed to work in cold weather: it drives perfectly for 10 miles before the water in the radiator just freezes no matter what you do. I&#x27;ve seen all the instructions about how to clean this every week and I followed them. The point is that the head lets moist in upon its first exposure to water. The one week deadline for cleaning it is the time that things begin to feel unacceptable. I&#x27;m not a particularly lazy or disorganized person, but this toothbrush didn&#x27;t work for me. The mold gets unmanageable and hard to remove also pretty soon so I guess this flaw beats everything else this product has gotten right.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 year old son. Brush is very soft. Seems to just vibrate instead of going around?? The seam where you  open in the middle gets a big gunky, a quick wipe is needed after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 10 years that finally died. These are great units.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  I delayed as long as possible in buying a new one because the last new one, a different model from Costco, didn&#x27;t work as well.  After nearly a decade I finally found a suitable replacement.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> For my husband. We have had these electric tb&#x27;s for years and would not change.</li>
            <li> garbage, we already threw them away as the internal battery dies in about 7 months</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li> I like Philips Sonicare products. This is my second such product; earlier,  I had an e-series. This product works well and I am getting used to the new brush. I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator which would be useful to know when recharging required.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned. Great product. The first one lasted me over 5 years before the base started yellowing.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothbrush in the world. It grows mold inside under the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years after my dentist pointed out that I had really bad plaque.  The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Essence line is the cheapest of the Sonicare line featuring only a 2 minute timer.  I&#x27;m a little peeved that they&#x27;ve stripped the 30 second interval timer from the cheaper models (they do throw in a travel bag...which I tossed...).  The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage. But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes with a charger and the standard size head...and I use the compact, so I had to purchase that separately.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare electric toothbrush in probably the last 7-8 years. I love their dependability and quality (you can always count on the Sonicare name). I have actually just gotten back from a two week vacation in Europe and brought the toothbrush with me (without the charging stand) to save on minimal weight and space in my luggage. I actually thought it would run out of the charge at some point and I would have to use it &#x27;un-electrified&#x27;. To my surprise, even after using the brush a minimum of twice a day, the Sonicare 5600 maintained the charge. The carrying case was compact and protective and actually made the portability of the toothbrush an ease. As far as the teeth cleaning goes, I love Sonicare. My teeth always feel dentist-fresh twice a day and I know that my check-ups have improved greatly over the years by using Sonicare in contrast to other toothbrushes. I highly reccommend this toothbrush to everyone. Holds a charge, cleans teeth flawlessly and will last for years.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that i buy an electronic toothbrush and i fell in love with it when i saw it in my dr&#x27;s office but it was 99 dollars it was too expensive i then searched on here and this seller had the same brand for much less i have been using it and i love it im thinking of buying a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Sonicare Essence 5600 is an excellent basic electric toothbrush.  The Essence 5600 just has an on/off switch and a 2-minute timer.  In my opinion, these features are sufficient for most people.  Other models have slightly more features.  For example, I use a Sonicare HealthyWhite 3 Mode toothbrush, which has a setting for Clean, Sensitive, and Clean and White.  You can actually hear and feel the difference at the different settings, e.g., the sensitive setting doesn&#x27;t vibrate as vigorously as the clean setting.  The vibration of the Essence 5600 is like the vibration on the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; setting on my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like about the Essence 5600.  First, it costs more to replace the brush heads.  A 3-pack of brush heads for my HealthyWhite is cheaper than a 2-pack of brush heads for the Essence 5600.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the Essence 5600 is not compact relative to other electric toothbrushes.  (1) The Essence 5600 is just big in almost every respect especially compared to my HealthyWhite.  First, the handle itself is much larger in diameter.  (2) The brush head is also big (as it includes the dome shaped connector to the body of the toothbrush).  (3) The charger is also bigger because the HealthyWhite came with a separate travel charger that was really compact.  (4) The travel case for the Essence 5600 is a soft case, which is unlike the HealthyWhite&#x27;s hard case.  Although the Essence 5600&#x27;s case is smaller, the hard case for the HealthyWhite allows you to carry two brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! At first, it&#x27;s ticklish, almost to an annoying degree but don&#x27;t let that deter you from using this brush because the sensation goes away after a while. And, it has an \\&quot;adaptability\\&quot; feature so that the first 12 uses it gradually introduces you to the feeling of a power toothbrush. I had already used a power toothbrush, so I&#x27;m not sure I noticed. I like the 2 minute feature--I&#x27;m going to get these for my kids, so that they know how long they are supposed to be brushing. And, these are more reasonably priced than some of the sonicare line. Invest in your dental health and buy yourself a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for a number of years based on the recommendation of my dentist. I&#x27;ve had to have quite a lot of reconstructive dental work and my dentist wise surmised that I want it to keep in its current condition as long as possible and he recommended Sonicare as stacking the deck in my favor. I&#x27;m sold on Sonicare in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you get a Sonicare? Yes. Without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular unit, the HX5610/01, is actually my 2nd Sonicare. It&#x27;s what I will call the &#x27;basic&#x27; model and I consider my &#x27;weekend house&#x27; toothbrush.  I also have the [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 HealthyWhite R732 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; version, that I consider my day-to-day Sonicare. Both units are the cr&amp;egrave;me of the crop tools when it comes to cleaning teeth. What sets the &#x27;basic&#x27; model apart from my &#x27;deluxe&#x27; Sonicare is seemingly minor, but is worth mentioning. To appreciate the difference, you have to know how you use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To properly use Sonicare, you use it for 2 minutes. Exactly 2 minutes. 30 seconds on the top teeth on the outside, 30 second on the top teeth on the inside of your mouth, 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the outside, and finally 30 seconds on the bottom teeth on the inside of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model has a small &#x27;beep&#x27; every 30 seconds to keep you on track. The &#x27;basic&#x27; model has no beep, no cues to keep you moving along. It seems minor, and in the scheme of life, it is. It&#x27;s just that I really find my self *wanting* that feature on the &#x27;basic&#x27; model. It&#x27;s just not there. This seems like a fairly arbitrary omission on Philips&#x27; part. This omission is the only reason I have given this brush 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some cosmetic differences between the 2 units. The &#x27;basic&#x27; unit is heavier than the &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model. Lastly, you can&#x27;t share brush heads between these 2 units because they have different connectors at the base of the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the more expensive model, but for double the price, I&#x27;m not sure its &#x27;must-have&#x27; feature I find so valuable in the more expensive model should sway you to the more expensive version. You may not miss it at all. Especially if I hadn&#x27;t told you about it. Sorry about that./&gt;I prefer the more expensive model, but for double the price, I&#x27;m not sure its &#x27;must-have&#x27; feature I find so valuable in the more expensive model should sway you to the more expensive version. You may not miss it at all. Especially if I hadn&#x27;t told you about it. Sorry about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 Sonicare brushes.  This is the most basic unit that I&#x27;ve used.  They all have provided a great clean feeling and really make a huge difference from a regular toothbrush.  I have not noticed a bit of compromise in the brushing between this and the more deluxe versions that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  It holds a great charge for I&#x27;ve taken it on several trips and not had to recharge after several days of usage.  Two points that I do not like about this brush:  It does not have any 30 second timer like the more upgraded units have to notify you to change brushing locations.  I had always found that a nice feature to make sure you get an even cleaning. It is also much larger than the more expensive models.  If you plan to travel a lot with it, you might want to look into a different model.  With those two aside, it is a great, inexpensive toothbrush and does what it&#x27;s suppose to really well.</li>
            <li> Good enough for beginner.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time. Only wish it could be smaller.</li>
            <li> great service for exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Utilitarian product. Works well. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> My BF loved it. But one minor problem., There is load noise when using it. Sounds like Drilling, but still acceptable. I am fine with that since I onlu paid 25$ bucks for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few weeks. I had a Sonicare years ago and just couldn&#x27;t get used to that buzzing feeling in my hand after I brushed! I guess I&#x27;m more tolerant to it now, or it just doesn&#x27;t affect me the same. The first charge seemed rather slow, over 24 hours. I thought that was unusual, but not a deal breaker. I keep it on the charger each day so it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go. The travel bag comes in handy to keep the toothbrush separate and sanitary. I&#x27;ve received a few compliments on my teeth looking whiter since I started using this Sonicare. People thought I bleached my teeth! I would recommend this to anyone who wants their teeth feeling cleaner each day!</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic toothbrush, I love using it.  My teeth feel so clean after using it, I actually brush more than before.  The 2 minute timer is really helpful, as I can&#x27;t say that I would usually brush that long using my manual toothbrush. My dentist has been recommending these for years, telling me how good they are for my gums and for keeping plaque at bay. We&#x27;ll see what she says at my next cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is nice to hold, not loud and holds a charge for quite a long time.  I pack it with me using the travel case as I brush my teeth after lunch, but I&#x27;m not buying another one for the office - yet.  Coming from a manual toothbrush to this makes me wonder, what took me so long?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite no frills and there are models that do more, but at the heart of the Sonicare is an excellent toothbrush. I like this so much, I might put this one at the office and get a different model for home, maybe with the quad pacer and different modes. I like it very much and I am rating it four stars and will reserve the fifth after my dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Got these for the price.</li>
            <li> Last periodontal exam, my dentist and assistant marveled at the lack of plaque. I mentioned I just got a brand new Sonicare toothbrush. It may have made the huge difference they noticed from my old model.</li>
            <li> Broke my old one. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a lesser model than what I had before and I wish it had the 30-second beep to move quadrants.  Otherwise, it seems as powerful as my former model.</li>
            <li> My dentist said after I started using Sonicare that he had never seen my teeth look better. Next time around I will spend the extra money to get the Sonicare with the four times 30 second timer.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush after my father recommended it.  I had two cavities in two years, and I was regularly brushing and sometimes flossing.  I used this for eight months, and when I returned to the dentist for my cleaning and check up my teeth and gums were in great shape!  Keep in mind that I flossed even less than I had with my traditional toothbrush.  My cleaning took no time at all because there wasn&#x27;t any build up of tartar.  The vibration of this toothbrush had swept away all the stuff my traditional toothbrush was missing, and it was great for my gums too.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in upgrading.</li>
            <li> The handle is wider than most electric toothbrushes, it&#x27;s like holding a flashlight. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush it&#x27;s my fourth one</li>
            <li> Received in a short amount of time, as described</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and the price was really competitive too. I have recommended this to several friends.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one I fried on Europe. Only wish the dual voltage one wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Perfect Amazon deal too!</li>
            <li> Our first one like this lasted seven years and my wife and I use it two times a day each.  This is a great little product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush and I love having a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are in great shape after using this product.</li>
            <li> This device performs well but for one very important thing. It does not alert you every 30 secs. as do other models, so you have to either count or guess how long to brush each quadrant.</li>
            <li> Had one before that finally died after five years, so I bought this as a replacement. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare I have owned.  They are great for maintaining healthy gums and give a clean feeling.  The first one I owned was purchased around 8 years ago and had the older NiCad battery technology which eventually died.  This new one has updated Lithium battery technology, which should last longer without the NiCad memory effect (I hope).  The older attachments I had for the old Sonicare are compatible with this new Sonicare.  The charger for North America is 120V only -- don&#x27;t assume to use the charger in areas with 220V like Europe.  It holds a usable charge for over two weeks, so you can leave charger at home for typical two week vacation travel.</li>
            <li> really good product.Well made. Timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> WoW! I have wanted one of these for years now. Finally have this one. Love it. Sturdy, feels great in my hand. Leaves my teeth feeling fantastic!! I am hoping my dentist sees a difference on my next check up. Easy set up, just plug in, attach the brush head, and let it charge. So simple.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare that I have had. The first one lasted for years and My dentist was pleased at how well it cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist &amp; had a cleaning each time.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Everything is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> ok product. need to have variable speeds.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older, more expensive model that had lasted for about 7 years.  Hope this one does as well.</li>
            <li> Item was a gift to family member and they are pleased with product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing clears plaque off of areas I couldn&#x27;t grasp with a basic toothbrush &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Everything is good,only a little harder!</li>
            <li> Works great....this is my first Sonicare tooth brush, teeth feel clean and whiter! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> ╔■ Price Point: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠■ Overall Taste: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;╠■ Nutritional Factor: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;╠■ Need: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;╠■ Recommendation: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;╠► Overall: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;╚☼ The bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;╔ ■ Price Point: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Quality/Durability: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Need: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Recommendation/Giftable Factor: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ☼ Overall: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;╠ ►Who needs this:  Everyone&lt;br /&gt;╚ ►The bottom line:  At this price point this is a must buy. If you are afraid of the replacement brushes keep an eye out for “non brand name” ones that fit this. There are 2 things I love best about this. 1) You just put it in its cradle when you are done and it recharges. 2) It tells you the recommended brushing time. The power of it is just right and makes you want to brush more. You do get about 20x a charge if you forget to put it back. Just be sure to turn it off before taking out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 performs very well.  The reciprocating head does a thorough job in removing the daily plaque build on your teeth.  There&#x27;s no comparison to the teeth cleaning results as compared to using a hand-held tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Was replacing an Elite Pro Sonicare and noticed this one has no bells  and whistles like it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, meets my expectations. Would recommend to those upgrading from a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> By design, the brush leaks heavily,&lt;br /&gt;which requires user to take it apart,&lt;br /&gt;wash, and reassemble it with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure to do this invites all kinds of&lt;br /&gt;captured microbial action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why they recommend the expensive&lt;br /&gt;head replacement every three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonic seal is a practical and essential solution</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is nice, but the bristles seem a little soft.  My old one had better bristles.</li>
            <li> My hygienist  told me this system would make all the difference and it has.  This is my second as the old motor wore out after two+ years.  Good price, arrived quickly - will continue to replace as needed through Amazon</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush along with it travel case. It much better that the last model.  The case is tighter and keeps water out of inside of battery area.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift - she loves, loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy portability and great Sonicare results with noticeably whiter teeth within just a couple of weeks without messing with bleach or trays.</li>
            <li> really nice product!but much more expensive than the one sold in Walmart!</li>
            <li> great products. it really could help to clean my tooth. It is very powerful and you will feel smooth when it is working</li>
            <li> Does NOT come with a brush head!  False advertising here!</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist of 25+ years. The Phillips sonicare is the toothbrush that we recommend for our patients who just don&#x27;t master manual toothbrushes. It is the BEST one for removing plaque which is your enemy and the cause of all forms of dental disease! I have read about this model not having the 30 second timer to time your brushing per arch, but COME ON people. We are all grown up enough to count to 30 and switch arches. For this price the brush is phenomenal! And yes they do take some getting used to, and don&#x27;t ever start the brush unless it is IN your mouth, unless you enjoy cleaning your bathroom, especially the mirror! The heads are expensive to buy, but it is far cheaper than being referred to the Periodontists office&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my Sonicare toothbrush for several years. It took only a short time to get used to the feel of the toothbrush&#x27;s vibration. After brushing, my teeth feel much cleaner than they did with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being three years old, the Sonicare toothbrush still holds a normal charge, which usually lasts about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the cost of the replacement heads, ~$36 for four. If you change them as often as Sonicare recommends, you could spend a small fortune for the replacement heads. Actually the heads last considerably longer than what is recommended by Sonicare. I usually rely more on the appearance of the brush head than the color indicator that supposedly show when a brush head should be replaced. When I start seeing the bristles fanning out, I replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent product and I would strongly recommend it to others, if they can afford the ongoing cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Love my new electric toothbrush.  It really does a good job on my teeth.  Most of my teeth are crowns, but I feel that it cleans them well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one only for 7 months and now it can&#x27;t be fully charged -- normally it only takes ~4hrs to fully charge, but this time it&#x27;s already charged for 24 hours and the light is still flashing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I&#x27;m pretty happy with this one. Yes there&#x27;s a bit leaking but every time when I change the brush head I would clean and dry it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li> I have owned other Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and have always liked them.  They really help my dental health because I have a dry mouth which required extra care.  I do like the bigger brushes that this has but I understand they no longer make them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with plaque and my old-school manual method of brushing just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore. I finally decided to take the plunge and invest in a better toothbrush. This one is great - looks good, comes with a travel case, and states to keep a charge for 2 weeks. Happy with my purchase and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the 60 second built in timer with 15 second alerts, but we can count. Otherwise the same as the previous unit we owned for years. This is a good basic inexpensive unit.</li>
            <li> One month after purchasing and using this toothbrush I opened it up, to my surprise there was a bunch of black and brown mold in the handle. This is something that happens in all sonic care toothbrushes, and is not something that consumers are aware of when making purchases. Fricken gross, stay away. Seriously considering filing a lawsuit.</li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare I have purchased in type last 10 years all have lasted twice a day brushing for at least 4 years looking at the other models they pretty much are the same with some fancy bells and whistles for more money.</li>
            <li> It works ok but I&#x27;d buy the next model up next time.</li>
            <li> I really love the Sonicare, especially after my semi-annual checkups.  So much better than the manual and other electric brushes,</li>
            <li> I went through 3 of these, sending them back via Amazon (which has been great).  Finally when one worked well I kept it.  It worked for about 2 months and then it started doing the same thing the other two did from the get go.  It would work for about 10-15 seconds, and then stop.  Push the button and it would vibrate for about a second and then it would stop.  It then devolves into click-buzz-stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, October 1st 2014, I dump it into the trash that comes tomorrow.  I&#x27;m done with it.  I went through 3 different instances of exchanges and all of them had this problem.  Amazon support has been great, but this is crap product.</li>
            <li> This is my second one after a few years, pretty good deal for this brush</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and is a worthy buy.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal on a toothbrush but I had bought so many things that I was forced to send it back because I didn&#x27;t have a use for it.  Shipping was fast but I now have to pay to ship it back (consequences of a wrong decision) oh well, I learned a lesson!</li>
            <li> Better design than the old one.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Holy cow! This toothbrush is FAST! I absolutely love it. I used to own a Crest rotating/vibrating toothbrush and, though it&#x27;s ok, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to how good this is. It actually feels really good as it brushes against your teeth and gums, you can really feel it cleaning it your mouth and massaging your gums. It is actually very pleasant and far less abrasive than other cheaper vibrating toothbrushes out there. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B before this and it never got my teeth as clean as this brush does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is pretty quiet and does a fantastic job of getting my pearly whites just that - white. You can really see the difference. This brush shuts itself off after two minutes and that&#x27;s it. No annoying thirty-second blips or multiple settings to fiddle around with. It&#x27;s just on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely easy to use and clean. A simple rinse and dry after use and then back in the charger. Easy and effective.</li>
            <li> How can you not love a Sonicare toothbrush? After using a regular ol toothbrush for many years, I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a Sonicare toothbrush.  My life has been changed people, CHANGED!  Please, do yourself a favor and buy this toothbrush, you will be forever happy.</li>
            <li> My teeth&#x27;ve  never been so clean</li>
            <li> Works well and quieter than my older model.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  A electric toothbrush can be a bit of a scary feeling on your first few uses but Philips has built in a gradual pacer that happens over 12 uses.  You can work up to the full effect if it&#x27;s your first experience with electric toothbrushes.  Philips Sonicare are the best on the market, in my opinion.  The 2 minute timer really keeps me honest :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for some time now.  Out of the models I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.  It has fewer bells and whistles than some of the other models, but, as a result, it seems to be more reliable and durable.  When the more complicated versions die or start experiencing glitches, I just keep coming back to this reliable model.  This toothbrush seems to last forever without having any mechanical issues.  Also, because it is less complicated, this model is very affordable compared to some of the other models, but it leaves your teeth just as smooth and clean as the others.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really thought about giving an electric toothbrush a try...Like an electric razor, it seemed pointless: Why get an expensive gadget, when I can do the exact same thing on my own, for a fraction of the price? I went in with an open mind, and I immediately disliked the results.....I felt like my teeth and head were going to vibrate apart after twenty or thirty seconds. I diligently kept using it, three times a day, and after a few days, I got used to the vibrating sensation, and started to appreciate how clean my teeth felt after brushing. The toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, and I was impressed at the ingenious design of the charging station...the toothbrush just sits atop the charger, and charges without having to be positioned just so, or making sure Part A is nestled firmly against Part B. It comes with a little carrying case that appears to be able to hold the toothbrush and the charging station (I haven&#x27;t actually tried it to see if they all fit.....), and the toothbrush comes apart easily for quick cleaning. That said, I was less than thrilled to find that the various parts of the toothbrush are NOT watertight, and will admit water, toothpaste, and saliva. That kind of grossed me out, so now I take it apart and clean it and dry it every day. Also, you&#x27;ll want to start brushing topless and not looking it the mirror, because the spit will be flying, and will make quite a mess. Keep your mouth closed, and brush bent over the sink!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product. It remains to be seen if I&#x27;m fully won over by the electric toothbrush, but, for now, I&#x27;m digging this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. It&#x27;s tough compactness ensures a good grip and the simplicity of its \\&quot;control interface\\&quot; (only one button!) is also a pleasing experience.&lt;br /&gt;The problems: I have no idea how much battery life is left--I do appreciate the other Sonicare brushes with the battery life LED levels. The other Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve used also had a pretty good feature--it&#x27;d buzz when it was time to move from one surface side to another. The total brushing time for this beast is supposed to be two minutes so my silly yearning for scientific toothbrushing (I kid, but not really!) is spoiled because I have to guess when to move from the top outside surfaces to the inside.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this, but some may not: there&#x27;s a bit of ferocity in there. According to the manual, the brush allows 12 uses before it switches to full strength, but I didn&#x27;t notice that. It was an assault from the get-go. Again, I like this and it makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is very good in spite of the lack of battery level marker. I&#x27;ve been using the brush everyday for almost a month without noticing a drop in brushing buzz strength. I also like the carrying case which is small and holds the brush head and body quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars.</li>
            <li> no plaque,shining white teeth at the dental check. Dentist states that the gums are healedand healthy. Buy one now for the same results.</li>
            <li> This brush works exactly as described. Quality is good and performance is very good. I would purchase this brush again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. When you use it, it is automatically timed to go for two minutes and it doesn&#x27;t bother or irritate my gums at all. Would recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> Good for a year or so, then crapped out. Bought a Oral B and is still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li> this is my second one.  the first one&#x27;s battery started to go.  I just don&#x27;t feel clean using a regular toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular one</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.  I was an oral b user for years and never thought about using sonicare until the battery consistently crapped out.  Now that I bought this I&#x27;ll definitely stick with this brand.  Feels much cleaner and the battery actually stays charged!</li>
            <li> I had to search pretty hard to find this but it was exactly what I needed, a replacement handle &amp; brush for my older Sonicare  toothbrush. I was hoping to find the same part number so it would fit my old charger but that turned out to be no problem because they send a new charger for it as well. A great product.</li>
            <li> Very good purchase. I only wanted the tooth brushing option, and I did not need all the bells and whistle options. It is so much better than the battery spin type brush that I had been using and resulted in a not so favorable dental visit. My only complaint is that the two minute timer does not split into 30 second seconds the way other models do. Nevertheless, it is a very good value relative to the other fancier models. One hint: when you register online, Sonicare extended the two year warranty by an additional 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am replacing one I bot over 10 years ago.....hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I have always had very healthy teeth and gums.  Since I had my children, my gums have been exceptionally sensitive and bleed easily.  I purchased this in hopes that it would help.  After one week, my gums are healthier, my mouth feels so much cleaner and I feel that my teeth seem whiter from a better brushing!  I absolutely love it and will order one for my hubby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update:  February 5, 2013:  Since then I have ordered on for my husband and I am about to place an order for my preschool age kids!  LOVE it!**</li>
            <li> We bought our 3rd Sonicare after the first worked itself to death (old A series lasted for 3 or 4 years) and second (E series) pooped out before it was 2 years old. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the way it cleans - it can be credited with reversing gum damage for one family member. And we all love the way it keeps our teeth feeling as clean as our dentist hygienist used to do. In fact we can go longer between teeth cleanings and those done are much less extensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important point I want to bring to everyone&#x27;s attention is how the charging instructions in the manual are WRONG! The manual says to leave the handle in the charging unit. Doing this will effectively &#x27;pattern&#x27; the battery to where it will hold less and less of a charge. The 3rd replacement we recently bought is a 2 handle one that we charged for first 24 hours and then used - without recharging - over 60, 2 min. uses before it would not work for 2 mins. We then switched out the first handle for a totally charged second handle that is then used for another 60-ish uses. If you don&#x27;t charge totally up and then discharge totally DOWN, the batteries will become less able to hold a long charge and you will be replacing a lot sooner than you would otherwise. Perhaps that is why the manual says to keep it in the charging unit?! Hmmmm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now and I LOVE IT, I usally dont write exaggurated reviews, but after being to the dentist and discussing my issues, mainly being lack of ability to reach/properly clean my wisdom teeth, I got this brush and it makes all the difference. Before I neglected brushing manually because it took so long to properly do the job and took effort, using this product... my teeth have never felt cleaner in my life except after a dentist visit. the sonic tech actually kills germs at the same time as removing plack and cleaning. run this over your teeth slowly, now scrubbing, and BAM, sparkling clean and clean feeling teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Havent tested the batery life yet, but will soon.&lt;br /&gt;Only slightly annoing thing with this is it has a &#x27;brush timer&#x27; that turns the brush on for aprox 2 min and then turns off, so if you like to do a through job, may have to press the button twice. no big deal though..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Sonicare since 2001. My first one lasted 6 years, second one 4 years, third one only lasted 3 years so the quality has gone down. I love this toothbrush so despite the fact I have to replace more often than in the past I am buying another. Sadly, if they keep going up in price and lasting a shorter period of time I will need to move on to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had the mold problem I&#x27;ve read about in some of the reviews but I do take the head off mine and rinse about every 10 days since I get toothpaste buildup at the base of the head.</li>
            <li> OK here&#x27;s the lowdown: this will get your teeth cleaner than a manual brush ever has. But it molds like a mother inside the housing constantly and seemingly within a matter of hours. It&#x27;s gross. I clean mine in a jar of alcohol weekly and keep it open as much as possible to dry out. Replace the heads, which are sort of pricey, about monthly.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth smooth and feels very clean! My dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!  This was replacing an electric toothbrush and I had for years.  I was really attached to the old one, but this one is awesome!  Seriously, great toothbrush for the money!!!</li>
            <li> its okay. but does the job. i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it broke down any time soon. seems cheap</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Broke after less than one year of use.</li>
            <li> I have always used Sonicare and would not use anything other brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you like moldy water collecting inside your brush which I am sure leaks into the bristles when you are using it...if you are confused by this, google it and you will be grossed out.</li>
            <li> I bought this in September 2014 and it died in April 2015, so seven months. That&#x27;s some crap.</li>
            <li> This looks exactly like the photo, it came in plenty of time, and it feels great!  CAVEAT:  If you have sensitive teeth, as I did, and note the past tense there! then do not panic, as I did, the first time you use it and it sort of hurts.  I was so disappointed by that, until I completely read the instructions.  This is to be expected, and it does go away!  The sensitivity was gone by the fourth time i brushed, and I love the way my teeth feel so much now, after brushing, that I brush much more frequently throughout the day!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Just got this in and it is great so far. Works as described. Easy setup and toothbrush charges easily. Travel case is a nice addition to the package.</li>
            <li> The more expensive model finally broke down after a few years, so I replaced it with this one.  Seems to work just as well as the more expensive one I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the HX5610 for about a week now.  Before trying it I had reservations about the extreme tickling I experienced in a brief trial several years ago.  The newer brushes like this one with progressive &amp;#34;power ramp up&amp;#34; seem to solve this; I have had no problem with tickling at all.  It takes some adjustment to get used to keeping my mouth closed while brushing; if you don&#x27;t do this you will have spray everywhere.  I don’t see that the base of the brush head ever gets any gunk on it.  I simply wash under the tap briefly with the brush down and wipe it off.  It is handy to be able to turn it on in a towel to more completely dry the brush off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning action is quite dramatic, and initially I felt like it was excessive.  With practice, I see that it is very effective at vibrating particles out from between my teeth and brushing is much quicker than with a manual brush; not excessive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not pleased with the cost of the brushes, but it obviously is a complicated unit; it would be nice if Sonicare came up with a replacement brush that more easily removes from the shaft, so that there is less to replace (the replacement brushes from Sonicare include the entire shaft with screw on assembly; there are aftermarket brushes that pull apart from the shaft, apparently with great difficulty).  There is a considerable amount of vibration in the brush shaft, so it is no wonder they needed a very secure attachment.</li>
            <li> How could you not love these things! There are only two downsides that i have found. One is the heads tend to wear out quickly and are costly to replace. Second is there is a gap where the head screws to the body. Its a place where mold can grow and cause it to smell badly. I purchased 4 of these for my family and all of them have the same issue, even though they are drying them off after each use.</li>
            <li> My wisdom teeth have always been an issue. I haven&#x27;t had any issue since using this toothbrush. Great product to buy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for at a price that was great! My other one of 10+ years needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered above expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> great product! fast delivery. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a electronic toothbrush. its one of the best out there! :)</li>
            <li> I have owned several of those battery operated vibrating toothbrushes. Those are so far below this, they are incomparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare was recommended to me for several years by my dentist. When I found this price on Amazon, I purchased two. One for men and one for my girlfriend, We can never go back to regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic action of the brush forces water between your teeth. Your mouth is left feeling much cleaner and the automatic timer helps to ensure you brush for the recommended two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed, an investment in your oral health.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about this tooth brush so I purchased it. It has the 2 minute timer on it and shuts off auto matically. I only have to charge it maybe once every tow weeks. It comes with a nice travel bag also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for nearly a month and I like it better than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  The vibration takes some time to get used to, but my teeth feel much cleaner.  Overall, I&#x27;m a satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li> We had bought two from Costco and one of the batteries died.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I bought this. It was a great deal. I am happy with the project</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush alway feel like my teeth are clean just like leaving the dentist. I love the timer it will automatically shutoff after two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> I really like the Sonicare toothbrush. After 6 years, my old one just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Rather than get a newer model for lots more money, I looked around for an older one that costs less. I left this on my wish list for several weeks, and during that time, the price came down considerably. Because the price appears to fluctuate a lot, that seems to be a good thing to do. Wait until it&#x27;s around $40.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my worn out toothbrush....got the same model as the old one...does a good job as designed. Very good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to school to become a Dental Hygienist and always looking for new toothbrushes and I came across thing one, its inexpensive and cleans SOOO well. You can feel it. I would recommend this to friends and family.... Actually, I already have.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd one.  left the other n the hotel...oops.  works great</li>
            <li> great price, fast ship, very helpful in preventing plaque build up - very satisfied &amp; would recommend</li>
            <li> Had one before lasted five years and gave good service. Good brand/good service.Would def. rec. for good oral hygiene. Tks.</li>
            <li> It is good product. But how come the price down from $39.95 to $24.95 only in ten days. I am really disappointed</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> just go it, really like it</li>
            <li> Broken in two weeks!!! So disappointing !!!! And there is no body you can talk to! It seems Philips never think that they need to talk to you about their defective product!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Worked great for a few months but now won&#x27;t hold a charge.  It turns on, then &amp;#34;fizzles&amp;#34; out to off within 15 seconds.  I&#x27;m trying to get Amazon to replace.  This item should still be working for at least a year!</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth and gums feel super clean after using it.It is comfortable to hold and use. The charge lasts for at least a week. My two complains are: the charger barely holds the brush in place, it is very easy for it to fall down, so I have to put it on a flat surface to charge; also, the brush was very hard on my gums for first few days, but now I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Great toothebrush! Bought as a replacement for one I lost. Great price. Very happy. Teeth feel cleaner than with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the tooth brush well enough and I guess it&#x27;s doing what my dentist wants it to do...but those replacement brushes are pricey so I&#x27;m not so happy about that.</li>
            <li> My second one. First one lasted almost 10 years! Does a great job. It needs to be cleaned out about once per week. Some people object to that, but It&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever.  Dentist noticed the difference and I didn&#x27;t even say anything.</li>
            <li> This was a gift because I love my second sonicare and I think it saved my teeth; have had great dental checkups; much better than before I used it.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but does a much better job than a regular tooth brush (especially on hard to reach back teeth).</li>
            <li> Really like the smaller head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great introductory electric toothbrush. The brush head is soft and seems to be doing its job but it&#x27;s definitely too early to make a solid judgement. The battery life is alright. Easy to hold, about the size of a Wii remote. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush at a great prices</li>
            <li> It works fine but vibrates allot &amp; feels a bit strange. I have not had it long enough to assess how well it cleans teeth.</li>
            <li> It works positively great. I gave this as a present and the person using it was able to remove large blemishes on their teeth after several uses. It literally chipped the plaque off and lightened the teeth very quickly without hurting their teeth.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday,and i think it is very useful</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s old toothbrush completely lost its charge after 10 years and he insisted on getting this similar model to replace it.  It was a great value on Amazon since you had to buy two at Sam&#x27;s and we only needed one!</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for years, and we love the way that it cleans our teeth.  Dentist visits have dropped considerably since we have been using this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love brushing with electronic tooth brushes, but I was surprised that this model does not beep every 15 or 30 seconds  intervals. . It only times for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> love sonicare tooth brushes</li>
            <li> Use effect is good. The only drawback is that the 110 v voltage, replace toothbrush head no promotional activities</li>
            <li> I had been using electric toothbrushes that were low cost and basically disposable after a few months. My husband got this model and after observing him I got one too. I like it a lot and I feel that it reaches everywhere and does a thorough cleaning job. The charge lasts a long time. The travel case is handy, and we now only bring one base. I would suggest taking it apart, rinsing it and air drying it once a day. This seems to prevent gunk from accumulating.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd Essence had the 5500 which lasted approximately 6yrs. The 5610 works basically the same with the same features. All in all I am satisfied with the new brush. I&#x27;ll see how long this one last but the guarantee for the 2 1/2 yrs certainly helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn out two previous ones, this replacement is great.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use product, that does what it says!  It has a 2 minute auto-shut off timer, so you make sure and brush the amount of time you should, and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist.  Much better than a manual brush, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the opportunity to try out the Sonicare HX5610/01 electric toothbrush and after using it for about a month I have mixed feelings on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this toothbrush is really designed for a single person or for an individual who travels. This isn&#x27;t really a practical toothbrush for more than an individual simply because there&#x27;s no place to store an extra toothbrush head. I&#x27;m coming from using an Oral B electric toothbrush that had slots for storing more than one brush-head and was immediately disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a similar feature here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second this is a very basic electric toothbrush. For $70 you&#x27;re getting a single function electric toothbrush, simply meaning that there&#x27;s only an on/off button and no variable speed brushing or vibrating. There&#x27;s a built in 2-minute timer that&#x27;s the norm for electric toothbrushes; a charger; and a small storage bag. That&#x27;s absolutely it. The toothbrush itself seems to be either poorly designed or just an early design that&#x27;s never been improved upon. The major problem that I see with this brush is that water and toothpaste trickle down the handle and get inside the housing. After using this brush for a few days it left a mess of old toothpaste on the charger and my bathroom counter. Not only is this gross but I can&#x27;t imagine toothpaste and water trickling down the inner components of this brush being very good for longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I was floored that this new Sonicare is not only heavier and bulkier than my 6 year old Oral B electric toothbrush but also considerably louder. Brushing with this thing is like standing on a subway platform as a train flies by; in other words a jarring experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend this product. Even as an entry level electric toothbrush this is a hard sell given the price. Spend a bit more and upgrade to a better Sonicare or Oral B.</li>
            <li> I really like having this toothbrush. It is much better than brushing manually.</li>
            <li> This sonicare works wonders on my teeth, almost to just from the dentist feel. My only gripe is if the pastic part of the brush touches your other teeth it feels like a jackhammer in your mouth. Ratta tat tat! I&#x27;d think they would have a softer buffer on the neck of the brush, to prevent such an uncomfortable sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a cheap feeling base, I am wondering how long it will last, it feels cheap, which is a shame because the body of the brush (the fat part you hold) feels much more sturdy. The brush end also feels very cheap. So, the base at the bottom where the recharger is located and the top end, the brushing end, are much less of a quality product than the base mechanism, which houses the rechargeable battery and the mechanical parts.&lt;br /&gt;The travel bag is nice, and this brush stayed charged for four days, it may have gone longer but I forgot when I got home and just plopped it back in the recharger/holder.&lt;br /&gt;I will do an update in the future, as I often do for those interested in longevity. I&#x27;ve used it roughly two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, it is made in China.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare line of products is an effective way of brushing teeth and gums. The concept is about having vibration help in the brushing process and as long as the user follows the instructions it works wonderfully. However, it takes a set amount of time to use this effectively. If used in a rush-type manner you will not see the results you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually pretty skeptical when my dentist recommended it. It wasn&#x27;t that my brushing was bad but like a lot of people I was missing spots at times. When I eventually tried it I made sure to follow the instructions provided along with suggestions from the dentist. First, make use of the timer provided. The brush runs two minutes and then shuts off. Use the brush two minutes for the top and two minutes for the bottom. Second, make sure your angle your brush against the teeth in a way that works the gum line as well. This is where a lot of normal brushing misses. Third, after brushing use the massage setting along with mouthwash to finish off with a clean mouth. You do this by dipping the brush head into the mouthwash and massaging your gums for about a minute. All told, it takes about 5-6 minutes to complete the process. Do this everyday and your next check up will be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this as a superior way to promote dental hygiene. As long as you take your time and be diligent you will have great results.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh plus it keeps the plaque in check.&lt;br /&gt;Hygenist asked what I changed in my brushing method.  I said I am using a Sonicare brush and she said that is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased at Amazon and the price was affordable, shipping fast.  I have purchased bedding, small appliances and books from Amazon with 100% satisfaction with price, quality and convenience.</li>
            <li> Best tootbbrush ever&lt;br /&gt;Love the quality...and feels like  i ve been to the dentist after ever brushing...the best ever I ll buy 2 more</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good deal when I placed my order, but the toothbrush stopped working properly last month (only 4 months after purchase) and now a fully charged battery only gets me two brushing sessions at full power before the power drains. I don&#x27;t have the ability to have my toothbrush plugged in all the time, so this is a huge problem for me. I had my last Sonicare for years before the battery had problems.</li>
            <li> Product as promised works great.Delivered on time and in perfect condition. I had on for 6 years and found this to be a good replacement model.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, you will need to clean it as the part under the screw down replacement head gets damp (that&#x27;s what mold likes to grow in, damp places). Battery seems to last a long time, I have my charger put away most the time and pull it out very rarely.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and my teeth never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare in 10 years (I have two in use, one at home and one in suitcase). Only thing I wish this had was the 30 second timer for each quadrant.</li>
            <li> Owned several Sonicare products over the years and have always been pleased with them.  This unit is no different, the price is great and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have had a different model for years, until it decided to die. I bought this one on massive clearance ($30). the only complaint I have with it is that the old model would pulse every 30 seconds which indicated that the brushing needed to move to another quadrant. This one does not. However, it is my own fault for buying without the research. Great product none the less.</li>
            <li> I refused to buy an electric toothbrush for years because I figured I wouldn&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the Sonicare and it isn&#x27;t bad.  I don&#x27;t mind the vibrations and it is easy to clean (which you need to do regularly).  What I don&#x27;t like is that the brush heads wear quickly and they are expensive to replace.  I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for a month and I already need to replace the head, which easily runs $8-$10 a pop even if you buy a multi-pack.  I feel it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as the manual toothbrush did, but it is adequate.</li>
            <li> Everything is good tooth brush and delivery. Thank you My son liked the gift. Sonicare is s goof product. I have one.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare with the ultraviolet sanitizer just stopped working after several years.  I replaced it with this model.  The handle is much bigger (which I like) and the movement of the brush seems the same to me.  All I do is brush and I dont need the extras.</li>
            <li> I purchased it right after moving out my old apartment because I only need just ONE toothbrush rather than two! If you do want a pair of it, please go to Costco now -It&#x27;s on Sale- Two for $80</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.It brushes for two min and stops.my dentist asked me how my teeth was so clean,very little attar.took a four day trip,lef my charger at home.toothbrush worked fine.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great for me, the price is right and helps out my terrible tooth situation. Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday now. It is able to do a thorough clean for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;additionally, it does not consume too much electricity.&lt;br /&gt;with one fully charge, you can use about several weeks!</li>
            <li> MY OLD SONICARE DIED AFTER 13 YEARS...I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE HOW WEAK IT WAS UNTIL I RECEIVED MY NEW ONE. SO MUCH STRONGER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I like it a lot ... Only thing I don&#x27;t like  is sometime I feel like its too heavy to carry hehe</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare toothbrush years ago and used it until it was not useable anymore. I don&#x27;t know why I never bought another one. I think I had switched to Oral B for awhile but I was never really happy with that. I just got this Sonicare Essence for Christmas and I can&#x27;t understand why I spent so many years without one. This toothbrush is amazing! So much better than a regular toothbrush. The Sonicare technology really gets your teeth not just clean, but polished. I love brushing my teeth with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last Sonicare that I had was a much more expensive model, but the only feature that I miss is the beeping after every 30 seconds so you know when to switch parts of your mouth. That&#x27;s it. One small feature to sacrifice for a much cheaper price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the accessories ..the unit is easy to recharge and lasts for many, many hours.  Great product for traveling as well.  A full charge can last all week.</li>
            <li> Had one in high-school and now I just got this one on a super deal! $70 marked down to $40 with a $10 claimable coupon. $30 is a steal for this! My teeth are squeaky clean, lets see what the dentist says at my next appt.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare. It works well and is affordable. My teeth are cleaner and whiter. Additionally, it is very easy to bring this along during travel.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice medium range priced device that does what it claims.  You have to get used to the &amp;#34;sonic feel&amp;#34; as it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a standard toothbrush going over your teeth.  Once you get over the initial feel difference, I like the way it worked. This was recommended by my dentist to promote healthy gums (especially for my age at 60+)  I liked the Amazon price a whole lot better than the price that he offered to me while I was in his office!!  The design is good and the unit does not look or feel too bulky.  I really would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth so well! I love it :) if you havent tried it yet, STOP WAITING!! You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> vibrates a lot - gives very tingly feeling to the teeth - it also had very unpleansat touch to the teeth when stem hits you.</li>
            <li> For a first toothbrush more sophisticated than bristles on a stick, its simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel great!&lt;br /&gt;-2 Minute Timer to ensure a proper cleaning session (I usually brush for 3 minutes anyway)&lt;br /&gt;-Small brush head makes it easier to clean the molars all the way in the back.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li> This is the bare bones, no frills version of the Sonicare, without any of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no travel charger, no UV cleaning feature, no extra heads or color-code rings, and no audible signal or vibration for the 30 second change-over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it still does an excellent job on your teeth, which is the most important function after all.  It comes in an easy to open box, with a travel case and base charger, and is your basic one-man (or woman) tooth cleaning machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An improvement would be if they could include those little tongue-cleaning nodule-thingies on the back of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that it&#x27;s basic, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, February 3, 2013</li>
            <li> it would be impossible not to like this toothbrush. I have owned a sonicare for 10 years and this one is no exception.  They do all the work for you and you end up with clean teeth and healthy gums. Win-win.</li>
            <li> This thing is intense! Coming from a normal toothbrush the feeling is much different and takes some getting used to. Other than that I can feel that my teeth are cleaner and know I am doing less damage to my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to appreciate it because of the comfortable and thorough cleaning feature. If you desire to relax your arms and use it for long time, I advise you to purchase it without doubt as well as buy several substitutable brush head. More function like controlling the brushing time need to update it to advanced version, which cost more than $150.</li>
            <li> Light weight, good for travel too!</li>
            <li> This product I got have a noticeable scratch on its body. Although this doesn&#x27;t affect the usage, I makes me very unhappy about the product quality.</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner after two uses!</li>
            <li> Ive owned four or five different Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrushes. Unfortunately in the past I have equated more technical features and higher price with better. That isn&#x27;t true with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive found that after a few weeks on the newer designed Sonicare toothbrushes they tend to lose \\&quot;torque\\&quot; or \\&quot;power\\&quot; because the brush strokes are so high. When I hit my back teeth they tend to slow down the actual brush strokes and bog the head of the tooth brush down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on christmas vacation at my aunts I noticed she had the Essence 5600 and she said she had it for several years. Its about the only model I had yet to purchase and try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped on a new head and gave it a try and after having for two years it was still powerful and did not bog down with any amount of pressure. As soon as I got back home I ordered one and Im finally content with the perfect toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the design of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes are actually flawed and this older head design is far superior. That along with the price makes this the right choice.</li>
            <li> Received in great condition and on time. This is my second Sonicare. Got my first one 8 years ago.  I cannot and will not ever go back to a manual toothbrush.  My dental check ups prove that this is so much better for my teeth and gums...even with little flossing, Sonicare gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy with her new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to cover the merits of using a Sonicare electric toothbrush.  Just use them.  Plain and simple.  You will save more in dental costs than you will spend on them.  I have been using them for probably over 15 years, and they are must-haves.  Everyone in my family uses them.  I have also used every major generation of Sonicare toothbrush and several models within each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Essence 5600 is styled like the original first generation.  Unlike the first generation which used NiCad batteries, this uses NiMH batteries which was used in the second generation.  The original first generation toothbrushes used an open sort of toothbrush head with a plate behind the brush.  This was actually a good head, although it rattled/buzzed if you made the little plastic guard/plate touch the moving brush head.  No big deal.  With these you occasionally had to unscrew the head and clean them out (with an old-style toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Philips/Sonicare has discontinued the original style head and gone with a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; head that fits both the first and second generation toothbrushes.  That is what you get with this model.  Unfortunately, despite the more effective and more comfortable head, these are plagued with the problem of mold, bacteria, and just general funk under the rubber seal.  The rubber seal just doesn&#x27;t seal at all.  Moisture gets in the heads, and shortly, there will be massive black and pink hairy things growing inside.  Just truly disgusting which is why you see some aftermarket (non-Philips) seals being sold.  Further, it is just next to impossible to clean these second generation heads.  See my remedy at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third generation (current) is truly the best.  They went with Li-Ion batteries.  The handles are smaller.  The heads no longer have a \\&quot;compartment\\&quot; in which to grow mold and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, with the progression of each model, Sonicare keeps adding more features which I don&#x27;t like.  I find quad pacer useless and annoying.  All of the additional massage and pulsing modes and what-not are just irritating because it makes such a simple device much harder to use.  For example, instead of a simple on/off, you now have to push the button twice or cycle through these modes.  This is important because if you push a button twice to cycle it and turn it off while it is in the middle of changing modes, instead of it turning off, it turns on, and your spit and toothpaste go flying, so now you have to clean your glasses, the mirror, and pretty much everything within 3 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, sorry to digress, but I have UNIVERSALLY found that the best model with in each generation is the most simple one without all the feature-laden whistles and bells, ridiculous UV cleaners, etc., which just drive up your cost both initial and in consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in sum, this has good battery technology, but you will have to be careful not to leave it in the charger and make sure you run it down.  In other words, you will have to run it like a usual Ni-MH battery product to get the maximum life of maybe 3-5 years.  If you don&#x27;t, then you can kill it is 1-2 years.  I like that this is a simple version and easy to operate.  It has a nice grip and travel pouch.  It it also is relatively inexpensive if you are new to Sonicare, but your next one will want to be the Li-Ion versions.  What I really don&#x27;t like about this is the terrible toothbrush heads which get funky.  My best recommendation for dealing with this is as follows.  (Disclaimer: this is not recommended or supported by the manufacturer.  Use at your own risk, yada, yada.)  Get some small, sharp scissors or a box cutter or utility knife and cut off that rubber seal -- which doesn&#x27;t seal anyway.  Then, after you brush your teeth just run some water down in there to rinse it out.  Without the seal, it will dry, and not get so funky.  At least 10X better, although it looks kinda MacGyver&#x27;ed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> Base is easy to clean, if a bit unstable.  Placement of nonslip sections on handle ensure holding brush at proper angle, but takes some getting used to.  Does excellent job of cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the one I already owned for 7 years.  The batteries are not replacable.&lt;br /&gt;Would never live without an electric toothbrush once I switched over from manual.  Wonderful product that also minimizes gum &amp; tarter issues. Retail prices are astronomical, Amazons are half the cost and free shipping.  If you never owned one before, start with this model.  Your investment is minimal.  Unit was as expected, but only comes with one brushhead.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself two years ago and I am very enjoy to use it. Then I brought this electric toothbrush for my boyfriend as gift, he loves it! After the first time he used it, he told me he never brushed his tooth so clean. It&#x27;s really a good choice for gift.</li>
            <li> It will accomplish the task of brushing your teeth like every toothbrush will but the design is horrible since it allows the build up of mold on the inside no matter what you do. You would have to unscrew it every time and soak it in peroxide to keep the mold from forming. I have owned the HX5500 for over 2 years and I have soaked it, taken qtips and peroxide to it, rinsed it after ever use, it doesn&#x27;t matter mold will form and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. My wife and kids have OralB ones without this issue so I&#x27;m going to go get one of them.</li>
            <li> Good price, works fine, and arrived on time</li>
            <li> hope this one last as many years as old one did,,</li>
            <li> This continues to be an excellent product.  I am a dental hygienist and recommend this to almost all of my patients.  The reduction in plaque, tartar and inflammation by just using this product is remarkable. With more effort people can have even better results.  I don&#x27;t recommend this to small children.  It vibrates and tickles your nose.  Many people cannot get past that but I have my patients make a promise to me.  That is to use the brush everyday for one week, THEN make you up your mind whether you like it or not.  I have NOT had one patient say they didn&#x27;t like it.  Your teeth feel SO good after each use!  Worth every penny and may keep you out of the Periodontist chair and that will save you pain and $1,000&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 2 months of use</li>
            <li> Having come from the Elite model of Philips Sonic Care, I miss the Quadpacer beep reminder at 30 second intervals; but this model does the same great job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Combine the Sonicare with a good toothpaste or Echodent Tooth Powder and your dentist will be asking for donations to supplement his/her income.</li>
            <li> Very effective!  I purchased it for my 11 year old daughter and its been cleaning her teeth wonderfully.  It even has a two minute timer.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is lightweight, easily charged, portable and the smaller brush is easier to use in small spaces.  I would recommend this toothbrush for children instead of the inefficient, childlike (toy) toothbrushes that never last very long.</li>
            <li> Best toot brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  My dentist noticed the difference from the first visit after I got it. Word</li>
            <li> I was recommend a Sonicare by my dentist 7 years ago and went for it. At the time it cost me well over $100. That one finally died on me so I checked the options and came upon this. It is that exact same toothbrush I had for much less than I originally paid for my first one. The only difference was the blue coloring on this one, but it&#x27;s a toothbrush who really cares about the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it cleans well, my dentist still recommends the Sonicare line. As for holding a charge, I have no complaints. I take the charger for anything over a week, but other than that it seems to last just fine. Likely to decrease with age though.</li>
            <li> Very great product and a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sonicare for years. My dentist (hygienist) even compliments me on my &amp;#34;home care&amp;#34; which I credit to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush is compact and easy to store.It also needs to be charged very infrequently. You can charge it and bring it on vacation for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works very well. And very easy on my teeth.  I wish it came with an additional brush like some of the others do.</li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth when I had a regular toothbrush. I had plaque, and food stains still on my teeth. When I got this toothbrush it was like a miracle. It&#x27;s tricky to brush in between my teeth because my teeth are crowded. I have seen improvements by using this toothbrush, I love brushing my teeth with this brush. I don&#x27;t want to ever go back to using a normal toothbrush. The only thing that I am concerned about is that there is gunk under the head of the toothbrush. I will wash my toothbrush daily to see if it gets rid of the gunk.</li>
            <li> very good experience so far, solid improvement versus regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent 2nd one I have bought.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I have used Sonicare for years.  This was a great price and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare toothbrushes.  I even give them as gifts on birthdays and at Christmas.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to, but worth it. Don&#x27;t wait any longer, get one now!</li>
            <li> Love this product Thanks</li>
            <li> Definitely need an adjustment period.  On/off button very sensitIve.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this it goes to fast in your mouth</li>
            <li> Love it. Less expensive than even Costco.  Very easy great cleaning!!</li>
            <li> it works well - no issues with this tooth brush.  Hard to keep it clean though.  Product suggestion would be to add a cleaning brush or solution.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this toothbrush. I was so happy it arrived quickly and I got to try it out. My teeth are sensitive to both hot and cold, but mostly cold. The dentist can&#x27;t use the Ultrasonic on me at the dentist either. With that said, I am certain this brush does everything is should. However, for me, it made my teeth became so SUPER sensitive after just 5 days of use that just breathing through my mouth made my teeth hurt. I had to drink everything through a straw so it didn&#x27;t hit my teeth. I dreaded brushing my teeth because it was so uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it. I had read the reviews saying it worked for sensitive teeth but It did not. I can use other electric toothbrushes with rotating brushes like Oral B, just not this one. It has a very obnoxious high pitched buzzing noise as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as replacement for the Braun&#x27;s Oral B with the rotating head which I had used for years. This one does almost as good, but since I have a small mouth the longer head doesn&#x27;t quit get to all my teeth as well. I also don&#x27;t like that it gets water inside the unit and has to be left apart to dry.</li>
            <li> Nice product, do help brushing teeth more efficiently. Just hope after each time charing the battery it could be used for more times, the first month the battery is very good but after several months have to charge it like every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and am fully satisfied with it. Easy to operate, easy to clean, and stays charged for up to two weeks. I especially like the way the drive motor is sealed off, in fact, completely isolated, from the brush. This is accomplished using a magnetic actuator. Also, the rechargeable battery appears to be completely sealed off from the charger (no metal contacts to corrode). Only one thing I might change is the way the brush is attached to the body. There is no water seal on this interface, so moisture can get inside. An o-ring would have solved this problem.  After each use, I&#x27;d recommend unscrewing the brush and drying inside the neck with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> We have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.  We&#x27;ve always had the model that signals every 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t.  We miss that feature but the lack of it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the cleaning.  It just makes it necessary to count while brushing.  Read the fine print.</li>
            <li> Amazing value, cost me $100 5 years ago and now $30</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! Once again Amazon exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li> Item just as described.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Teeth feel cleaner and look brighter.</li>
            <li> Works great and priced reasonably!</li>
            <li> Have been a user for several years.  This was a replacement when&lt;br /&gt;the original finally wore out.  Excellent way to brush the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years. It eliminated problems I had with gingivitis and other stuff that gets under the gums. Easily pays for itself in the money you save at the Dentist!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a second one for my husband.  It is very attractive on our vanity and is very strong.  After seeing the picture now, I realize that there was no traveling case with it.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed that until now.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement after 10 years. This seems to work well so far. The travel pouch is poor quality and tough to zip/close, I would trash it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to replace another SONICARE product. This brand is very good, and I like the &amp;#34;2 minute timer&amp;#34; associated with each usage.</li>
            <li> cleans great, comfortable to hold and use. My dentist recommended that I purchase this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Aaaah my teeth are so clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I share this so we just take off our heads when we&#x27;re done and there&#x27;s no gross buildup. It takes like five seconds to remove so it&#x27;s not a big deal. Charge lasts forever. Wish I&#x27;d had these my entire life - I imagine my teeth would be in much better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be of good quality and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she reverted back to manual brushing.  She said that it did not really give her the clean that she had with the old Sonicares that she&#x27;s had in the past.  I can agree because the one before had a power adjuster.  She does brush hard, but I think the brush head is a little too small for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it and I like it, but I&#x27;m not picky and I tend to brush my teeth for over 2 minutes, which helps me get that &#x27;extra&#x27; clean feel.  It does the job, but I think the next time, I won&#x27;t get the cheaper one.  For the price though, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Had excellent serve from the seller.  Got my purchase two days ahead of delivery date andt time of purchase.  Excellent toothbrush.  This is a replacement tooth brush of a Philips Soicare brush that I had before.  I like it very much and it did a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment. I&#x27;d say it cleans my teeth much more effectively than a traditional toothbrush or a basic electric toothbrush.  I think it cuts down on the overall time I spend doing dental hygiene.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if the head isn&#x27;t screwed on tightly enough, there&#x27;s no real indication to tell you.</li>
            <li> I just love my new toothbrush. It was like my old one but this works so much better. I am thinking of getting one more for my spouse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my boyfriend, and he love it.&lt;br /&gt;very nice toothbrush and very clean&lt;br /&gt;electric toothbrush is so convenient for daily life</li>
            <li> the holder is to large for the hand and it becomes hard to use the handle should be made smaller to fit in your hand</li>
            <li> Anything Phillips and anything Sonicare is reliable in its market group. This one is thick and heavy, be prepared for this property. On the otherhand it is a thorough item and competes well in the electric toothbrush offerings because it is the one to go with if you drop these alot in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Adler Music</li>
            <li> This works more-or-less as advertised.  I bought it as a replacement for a Sonicare &amp;#34;Elite&amp;#34; that stopped being able to hold a charge long enough for a single brushing.  This is heavier than the Elite and a bit bulkier.  It also seems not to have the &amp;#34;30 second&amp;#34; feature (every 30 seconds the thing pauses for a second an beeps so you know to switch mouth quadrants).  I thought it had that, but I guess I misread the blurb.  The cosmetics aren&#x27;t quite as nice as the Elite either, but it was under $25 (plus shipping &amp; handling of course) so if it lasts it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products for several years.  Recently I had migrated to Oral B finding the size, hand feel, and vigorous motion more to my liking.  This new offering from Philips has reversed that for me, the brush is slimmer and feels better in the hand that other recent models and I am pleased with how clean and well brushed my teeth and gums feel after use.  recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve had a model without a built in timer. No where in the description was this mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love this electric toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t be without it now</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; toothbrush and has been for many years. This was a replacement unit for a 5 year old one and I received it in a very timely manner through Amazon. Would recommend this product to anybody wanting the best of oral health.</li>
            <li> works as advertise very good product i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good Toothbrush! Teeth feel much cleaner after using manuals for years..</li>
            <li> Completely Satisfied From This Product And Price !!!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts me about 8 days brushing twice a day</li>
            <li> This brush has what I consider a serious design flaw that creates a very unsanitary situation. The \\&quot;green police\\&quot; have convinced Phillips that when the battery gives out, the owner should take the handle apart to dispose of the batteries. To allow the handle to be broken open there is a slot for a screw driver to be used as a pry bar to break the seal between the halves. The seal is on the inner margins of the halves leaving a slot  on each side running the length of the handle. This slot is 3-4 thousandths wide and at least that deep. There&#x27;s the problem.    After using the brush, I always wash it off an dry the surface thoroughly before retiring it to the charging cradle. I did this with the new brush after a 24 hour change. The next morning when I picked up the brush, the cradle was stuck to it. When I pulled the handle out there was a sticky material in the cradle. I cleaned it all out, but the next day the same material was there. I assumed there was a defect and sent it back to Amazon. The replacement arrive in a day, but the same sticky situation occurred. I called customer service, but it took three or four days to connect. They could not account for the problem, but offered to send me another handle.  While waiting for the handle to arrive and after finding the \\&quot;&#x27;goo\\&quot; was tooth paste, I realized that the water and tooth paste got into the slot, but cannot be cleaned out. Once standing in the cradle, the liquid settles downwind by gravity and ends up the gooey mess in the cradle. I e-mailed customer service with my findings and complaint. They were polite, but showed no concern. They gave me the name of someone to whom I could lodge a complaint. I haven&#x27;t bothered, as I&#x27;m sure it would be a waste of time. I wonder if anyone there reads the reviews here. Similar problems has been seen and reported!    I sent the second handle back and on the third handle used silicone sealant to fill the slot, hopefully solving the problem.    The bacteria in the human mouthare an ugly bunch. Human bites area very bad. Collecting and storing saliva in your tooth brush is not good. Phillips should correct this. If this was an automobile, there&#x27;s be a recall !! I do not recommend this model. Addendum: I used silicone to seal the openings Solved the problem.  No more drainage in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> Works just like my old one and is a whole lot less expensive on amazon!</li>
            <li> It took me some time to get used to the sound this toothbrush makes on my teeth, but now that I am they have never felt better.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I bough this to replace my old Sonicare elite, which I have had for about 10 years. This model is a step up, with rubber grips, and a built in timer. This is a fantastic toothbrush, and I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my Dad and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have also used to $90 version of the Sonciare.  Although that makes it dummy proof when to switch from the front to back, top to bottom, this toothbrush works just as well.  No whitening mode, but that is perfectly ok for $40.  Very comparable to higher cost Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Best investment !!! Save your gums and your teeth will love you :)))))</li>
            <li> Love it but the brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long. Replacement heads can get expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> The effect can be astonishing</li>
            <li> I had this product for about a year now, no problems.  Brushes are sturdy and keep firmness, I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love my electric toothbrush. Works great.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to use. Little expensive.</li>
            <li> Good product. My whole family have switched from traditional toothbrush to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint: the toothbrush heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush several years ago and have never had a problem. I love it so much! My mother has since bought the same brush and I just recently bought if for my girlfriend. They are all very satisfied</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been a lifesaver.  Since I got it &amp;#62;2 years ago I have not had a single cavity or dental issue.The ability to slowly adjust your teeth and gums to the sonic pulses is a huge plus.  After a week or so of using it I was used to it.  It totally leaves your mouth clean.  The one negative I would say about it is if you don&#x27;t regularly switch the brush heads water gets trapped between the brush head and the body.....which can lead to some pretty nasty residue.</li>
            <li> Our original Sonicare finally died after many years of use.  This one is the base model and works well and does what you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and they last a long time.When my last one went out I&lt;br /&gt;immediately started shopping for a new one. Amazon had the perfect buy at the perfect&lt;br /&gt;price.It&#x27;s great and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am si glad I made this purchase! This definitely gets the job done. My teeth are so shiny and feel so smooth! I will never go back to a regular tooth brush again!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!!! The only other time my mouth has felt this clean is by visiting the dentist them self! Highly reccomended!!</li>
            <li> Have used these toothbrushes for years. Love um</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model I owned for the last 7 years. Love it !</li>
            <li> Great  price for a great product</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and have always been optimistic about them, but when I started using my Sonicare, it made a world of a difference and completely changed my opinion. My dentist suggested to me to get an electric toothbrush because I brush too hard and am starting to have receding gum lines. This toothbrush does wonders! I don&#x27;t have to brush hard at all and let the brush do all the work. It shuts off after 2 minutes and you feel great afterwards every time. I used to dread brushing my teeth and now I get excited to use my electric toothbrush. A lot of the bad reviews are about mold build up and if you are conscious of water getting in and dry off the brush head after every use, you will never encounter this problem. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried many electric brushes .. This is the best.. Easy .. Light.. Strong !!! I really like it .. Hopefully it will last for years</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for same unit with a worn out battery (really silly that batteries was  cant be replaced). packageing was deceptive, package said $30 in coupons included, but in reality only $26 included. also 1 coupon wase for another tooth brush, why would i want another tooth brush when i just purchased 1.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Huge difference between this and using a regular toothbrush. There&#x27;s no going back once you&#x27;ve tried it. You can really feel and see the results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using an electric toothbrush but I really like it. It runs for two minutes and you get to know about how long to spend on each section of your mouth. The directions say it will keep it&#x27;s charge for two weeks. I charge it once a week and it is fully charged very quickly. I&#x27;m new to this and replacing the heads every three months is going to cost some money but it does seem like the toothbrush does a good job. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is says it is.  I only plug it in once a week to charge, it&#x27;d probably go longer but I just haven&#x27;t tried yet.  Great electric toothbrush for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> This product is very good as per price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t beep or buzz every 30 seconds to switch teeth.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  Super fast shipping!  Product as described!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The bristle arrangement made it seem like I was flossing my teeth and massaging my gums while brushing.  My teeth were never so smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this Philips Sonicare Electric toothbrush highly enough.  I got it to replace a previous model I had used for years that finally refused to recharge.  Before I used an electric toothbrush, I was having real problems with plaque, despite having regular dental cleanings.  Using an electric tootbrush has changed all that, and my dentist says I have minimal plaque and excellent daily care.  If you want to do everything you can to ensure a lifetime with your own teeth, invest in an electric toothbrush.  This model is reasonably priced and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I always wanted one of these, and it is as good as I had hoped.  And at a great price.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the second sonicare Ive bought. I love it and think its a great price too! It does get a little gunky inside, so you have to clean it out regularly, other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  THIS IS THE SECOND ONE WE ORDERED.  FIRST ONE AFTER 8 YEARS FINALLY BIT THE DUST.  HOLDS A CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I like the old version, like this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome. I bought this one to replace an older one which was starting to have a shorter battery life after five years of use. Five years before the battery started slowing down is excellent performance and a longer time than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrush is great! Ive got very sensitive gums and this toothbrush really helps with not bleeding in addition to whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> as expected , quality with a refreshing vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Both my daughter (20 yo) and I love this product. Never thought I would get an electronic toothbrush but it really makes a difference. I notice this particular one also is easy to find replacement toothbrushes in Target and Publix, when needed.</li>
            <li> best Healthcare ever!!!</li>
            <li> Best Toothbrush you can buy! I&#x27;m not afraid to admit, it had been 5 years since my last dental visit a few years back. However, I had been using the Sonicare for over a decade. The dentist approved and said, that&#x27;s why I had zero plaque build-up. He recommends it to all his patients. To the folks who say it gets mold in the cavity with the magnets. OF COURSE IT DOES! You&#x27;re supposed to clean that weekly. It takes a few seconds. Leave the brush head off and let it dry.... VIOLA! No mold! I&#x27;ve been through 3 of these brushes in the past 15+ years and won&#x27;t touch a regular toothbrush. I&#x27;m 43 years old, and never had one single cavity!</li>
            <li> Love it! My first electric tooth brush and it is great! Oh a little thing. When I opened the box it was packaged to look like it should have had another brush but it did not say it should have had another so all was well. Also the travel case is kinda cheap. Pretty much it is just a pouch with a zipper. But all in all I am VERY happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Sonicare toothbrushes and I&#x27;ve loved them both.  My teeth are super clean, brighter and whiter, and feel great.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stopped charging good after 2 months of use</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to, but works as advertised.  Keeps my teeth clean.  Wish it had a tongue scraper option.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare. My fiance and I had the same toothbrush, so we only kept one charging base on the counter and rotated as needed. Unfortunately, this new brush uses a different charging base, so our bathroom counter is more cluttered.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of these toothbrushes I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great and this toothbrush keeps it&#x27;s charge forever!&lt;br /&gt;Almost a month. My previous model had to be charged weekly, or.&lt;br /&gt;earlier!</li>
            <li> It works as efficiently as the discountinued HX9500 Model I replaced.  I love the way it massages my gums.  The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I like the design and functionality it, a bit small but guess that comes with the territory,</li>
            <li> good product, keep my teeth clen</li>
            <li> My dentist is very happy I bought this and so am I.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect Sonicare model.  The handle is slender and so it is easy to maneuver, the product is light in weight, and it is much quieter than the HX6711 model, which I bought by mistake intending to buy another one of these.  It does a great job of removing plaque and cleaning the teeth.  Note that this model is labelled &amp;#34;Clean and White&amp;#34; on the handle.  But inexplicably the company never refers to it that way.  If you want to buy replacement brush heads, this model is one of several different models that Philips calls &amp;#34;Healthy White.&amp;#34;  You must go by the model number, HX5610, to find the correct heads.  The photograph next to this review is INCORRECT; my Model 5610 is much more slender and does not have the big dome shape below the brush head as is shown in this photo.  This photo does look like the HX6711 model I bought, which is heavy, bulky, noisy and has an uncomfortably strong vibration during use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is really a good one.</li>
            <li> great little toothbrush !</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. The price was nice as well considering amazon has a coupon for this which takes $10 off at checkout.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well after charging for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have 2 kids in braces, plus have had a lot of dental work myself, including currently having a permanent retainer. I bought the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush because I thought it would be more efficient and do a better job of removing plaque and keeping teeth and gums clean and healthy. This model does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the basic model of a Sonicare, but you really don’t need all of the bells and whistles that come with other models! This model has a 2 minute timer so you, and your kids, know when you have been brushing for the dentist recommended time of 2 minutes. It has a comfortable soft-grip handle and comes with 1 contoured brush head. We bought extra heads so we can interchange the heads so each member of the family has their own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easy start feature made it simple for even my 7 year old to get used to using this electric toothbrush. It also comes with a convenient travel case, which comes in handy when we have to go out of town for tournaments or vacations. The battery lasts about 2 weeks so there is no need to take the charger base with us for our shorter trips. The travel caps for the brush heads also help keep the toothbrush clean inside our toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we started using this electric toothbrush by Sonicare, we have been very happy with the results! My children are coming home from the dentist with no cavities. Their gums are healthier and the dentist is noticing less plaque build up between cleanings</li>
            <li> We have used the Philips Sonicare for years.  I was most disappointed that there was only one brush and no stand for it.  Luckily I saved the original stand and am able to use it.  Also, the original had a sturdy case for the brushes.  I guess they&#x27;re trying to save money, but it&#x27;s too bad for the purchaser.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping, excellent product. Have used a similar toothbrush  for 6 years. My dentist says, &amp;#34;keep up the good work.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great deal, specially with the $10.00 off immediately.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement to my last Sonicare toothbrush that had worn out. I like it a lot. It does exactly what I was expecting. I would buy it or another Sonicare toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> We will never go back to conventional toothbrushes...I had no idea how ineffective it was to brush my teeth manually. All those years of proper dental hygiene lost. So glad to have discovered the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush in the mail at the scheduled time frame.  Opened the box and everything was included that was supposed to be in the box.  Charged the toothbrush and it works very well.  I&#x27;m enjoying that it is not too sharp/hard nor too soft, just right.  Have no complaints and am using it at least twice a day!</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great $40 electric toothbrush, I believe this is the older model however when compared to newer models the only noticeable difference is the size of the handle/battery (this one will last a month on a single charge and I brush twice daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer this to the other $80 sonicare models because of the price mainly. I ordered this for my sister since I have the same exact one which I purchased at BedBathBeyond for a similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are replaceable at an average cost of $10per head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial week of using electric toothbrushes did need some getting used to since your entire mouth is vibrating rapidly, but after that week I got used to it pretty quickly. Does come with base charger and travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;However I still use the traditional toothbrush when I travel just to save weight in my bag and its noticeable when you switch between electric and hand toothbrushes, I subconsciously feel that my teeth are not as clean when I use the traditional toothbrush after using the Sonicare for the past 6months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful in any way please click the \\&quot;YES\\&quot; button below</li>
            <li> The absolute best electric tooth brush I ever owned.  Does a great job and stays charged for a long time.  Lesson learned - you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised Sonicare is still making this model.  I have owned Sonicares for years, probably bought 6-7 of them and my whole family has them.  There have been several generations of Sonicare, and up until the most recent generation, they had two critical flaws in my book, and this model shares those flaws:  (1) they only work on 110v - so if you travel outside the Americas, you have to carry a heavy converter (not adapter, voltage converter) or else they burn out and (2) the brush head is poorly designed so that water and saliva goes down into a reservoir inside which becomes a gunky stinky mess.  The entry level new design corrects both of these problems and is available on Amazon for about $10 more than this one -- and well worth it.  It&#x27;s called the Sonicare Easy Clean.  [[ASIN:B004M1BO3U Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps... if you order this brush, just know about the two flaws above... other wise, like all Sonicares, it provides excellent cleaning and you&#x27;ll love using it.  If price is your main consideration over all else, this is the model... otherwise spend a little bit more for the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Sonicare likes to keep this style around to offer more affordable entry into the Sonicare toothbrush line.  It is a bit surprising that this larger model with the older style brush head connection is still around and being sold as new.  Compared to the older version this model does offer a travel pack and better grip, but doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much else new.  Regardless of that, Sonicare is still my favorite when it comes to electric toothbrushes and this version is a good value even with the older design.  For those not wanting to spend a lot on a brush this version offers long batter life, two minute timer, charging indicator, and travel pouch.  If you are new to Sonicare just remember one thing, the replacement heads are not cheap compared to the actual cost of the whole Sonicare brush itself. Obviously Phillips money making is in the replaceable heads and not in the actual selling of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do not like about this style of brush is the head connection itsef.  Water and toothpaste can get into the head connection and it gets kind of nasty looking after a while. My wife uses this one style and she has to flush out the head connection with hot water to get all of that out, or replace the head itself.  I have the thinner higher priced whitening model and it does not have this design so I do not have to wash out the head connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind when you are considering one is the cost of this model compared to the thinner, lighter, and better designed higher priced models.  If you travel a lot having the thinner model might be the way to go as the batter still lasts over 7 days and it is easier and lighter to carry.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare. I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  Another nice thing was that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when I use this toothbrush. For as long as I can remember my gums have bled after brushing my teeth, even when brushing by hand.  I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my[[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] this one has a bigger brush head. Instead of replacing just the brush on the stem [[ASIN:B000WHNI2I Philips Sonicare HX6013/90 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack]] you have to replace the whole top part [[ASIN:B0046AAVR2 Philips Sonicare HX7002/30 e-Series Replacement Brush Heads, 2-Pack (Frustration Free Packaging)]] which is more difficult to unscrew and replace.  It also is more difficult to clean because it doesn&#x27;t just pull out like my old one, and it&#x27;s possible to get fluids under this brush base so you do have to clean it. The whole toothbrush isn&#x27;t as compact as my older model either.  The charging base is larger and the handle of the brush is wider.  What I do like better about this model is that the movement is a little stronger than my older model, the brush seems to move faster and have a little more power.  I think it cleans my teeth faster. (Not that 2 minutes with either toothbrush is all that big of a deal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a two minute timer like my older model.  It stops after 2 minutes and you have to restart it again if you want to continue. (Why does 2 minutes seem so long when you&#x27;re in a hurry?)  My older model had little pauses that you could hear after each 30 seconds so you knew how long you were spending on each part of your mouth (Quadpacer Technology). This model doesn&#x27;t have that, but I didn&#x27;t really pay that much attention to it anyway. Both are easy to take along when you travel.  This one has a nice little carrying case.  Once it&#x27;s charged it will last for up to 2 weeks without being in the charger base. I don&#x27;t know how long the older one would hold a charge because it was compact enough to take the whole thing along when we traveled so I never let the charge run down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess my rating would actually be a 4-1/2.  I like that it seems a little more powerful than my [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] but I don&#x27;t like that the brush assembly is more expensive to replace and more difficult to disassemble and clean. Does it get my teeth whiter than the old model?  Well, my teeth are probably as white as they are going to get because I think that all Philips Sonicare brushes do an excellent job so I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two models in how they clean.  It&#x27;s all just a matter of what features are important to you.l had little pauses that you could hear after each 30 seconds so you knew how long you were spending on each part of your mouth (Quadpacer Technology).

            <li> brushes every clean, better than the oral B I used to use, if offers much cleaner brushing</li>
            <li> My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out.  This is now my third version of the tooth brush.  They seem to last me about 3 year a piece.  There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version.  The head are a bit smaller than they used to be.  The power is about the same.  The batteries seem to last longer.  (I forgot my charger on vacation and it only died the last morning of a week of vacation.  And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic.  The handle has blue strives up the side.  Since my wife and I both have sonicare tooth brushes it is sometimes hard to tell the difference (just a small circle of color on the bottom of the head.)  But now that mine has a blue handle I won&#x27;t ever accidentally grab the wrong one.  I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue i that they do need to be cleaned every once in a while.  I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did.  But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes - have used them for years</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  My first one worked great, but the battery on the new one gave out after less than a year.  Held a charge for less than a week, didn&#x27;t beep at me when the charge was getting low.  I hope this is an anomaly.</li>
            <li> Got this after my dentist recommended a sonic toothbrush. Like the size &amp; shape, cleans great &amp; I love the auto shut-off after 2 minutes - just wish it was QUIETER!</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an much older American made Sonicare that gave up the ghost from shear old age. I would have rated it 5 stars but for the lack of a 30 second hesitation &amp;#34;alarm&amp;#34; to notify the user to change quadrants. Why the heck Sonicare didn&#x27;t include that simple and very useful aspect to this is beyond me.</li>
            <li> brushes in the up-down pattern that is best for teeth. I always thought electric toothbrushes were silly, but no, they work. They clean.</li>
            <li> Does great job.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> gets teeth super clean. worth every penny. best toothbrush around. the essence model is basic but that&#x27;s all one really needs. i&#x27;m happy the price has come down from 150.00, original price for original basic model.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. sonicare only had one model</li>
            <li> I have had many different electric toothbrushes and this is the worse one i have ever had.  I&#x27;ve only had it about 5-6 months and my teeth don&#x27;t look or feel as clean as others i have used. Further, the top part i noticed has a space and i noticed that &amp;#34;liquids&amp;#34; get down into it which is disgusting. Oral-B&#x27;s may not last that long but they clean so much better!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first one lasted 8 years. For the price this does an excellent job. I use it twice a day. At Niger I floss then brush. My childcare healthy. My periodonitist contributes it to the electric tooth brush and flossing. A lot of people brush improperly. This product will help.</li>
            <li> I had the standard battery operated model and it was fine but it quit on me after a year. Several months later I had my teeth cleaned and the hygenist asked me what I had been doing different because I had too much plaque buildup. I immediately purchase the rechargeable model and I love it. My last checkup was much better.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning at the dentist. It takes some getting used to, the first time it felt like my gums were being tickled, but that went away once I was used to it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great my son loves it!</li>
