            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li>a while I love because its not as strong as</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is bold, and spicy, which is the kind of scent I enjoy wearing most.</li>
            <li>Bottles are unique, look pretty scattered around on a glass tray, good value, love price, and free shipping always is such a good thing!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this particular product.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s a very fresh scent soon as I run out</li>
            <li>She liked the gift set more than the vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool looking and sits well on the dresser.</li>
            <li>my new favorite perfume a lot for the value.</li>
            <li>I got a better deal buying the killer queen from this seller vs any store near me!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>5 hours intocwearimg and still decent and light scent.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, although I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s something really special or unusual.  </li>
            <li>A reapply might be needed but youll enjoy pulling out such a unique bottle</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy from this vendor/seller again &amp; again!</li>
            <li>And the box is so pretty hope</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the Katy and the seller.</li>
            <li>I first came in contact with this perfume at work from a coworker who had a sampler in her pocket.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite fragrance for several years.</li>
            <li>And if anyone is wondering if it&#x27;s real, it is!</li>
            <li>Reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Actually bought for my Mother in law for Christmas, than I smelled it and fell in love with it and immediately ordered me one.  </li>
            <li>The color is very eye-catching.</li>
            <li>This was first Christmas to have new daughter in law.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size considering a single bottle of Killer Queen goes for about $45 dollars or more at the department stores.  </li>
            <li>The larger bottle looks really cool on the dresser.  </li>
            <li>She loves everything about this set especially the cool bottles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This item was hard to find a Christmas time, but not only was I able to get it for my daughter, the price was outstanding in comparison to local stores.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same gift box they sell in the department store.</li>
            <li>The soap made me break out however, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This gift set was for my 12 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>prominent smell but still subtle</li>
            <li>I feel I spent too much for it after shopping around.</li>
            <li>My husband got this set for me for Christmas and we were both a little hesitant because he rarely likes any female perfumes.</li>

            <li> My husband got this set for me for Christmas and we were both a little hesitant because he rarely likes any female perfumes.</li>
            <li> I bought just the small bottle at a Fred Meyer and it was $40 on its own and for $10 less you get a big bottle and little one</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, but it&#x27;s a bit disappointing because in all the ads they show it on a stand, but it doesn&#x27;t come with one.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how the smell is or how long it lasts for.</li>
            <li> Perhaps in a store display, but not in a gift set of a single bottle.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it last year when it first came out, but it was expensive at the department store.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the expected dated.</li>
            <li> item received in time and as expected.</li>
            <li> the bigger perfume and a little one PLUS lotion and shower gel for half the price..</li>
            <li> I still think ill be purchasing for the lotion and other goodies at some point in near future.</li>
            <li> Friend and i sampled and she got a gift set for valentines and offered me the little bottle.</li>
            <li> I take the small perfume in my purse.</li>
            <li> and I just became addicted to it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smell is great. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. Love Katy Perry Killer Queen. Stocked up and got 2 boxes. These sell for a lot more in the store. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted for Birthday!</li>
            <li> I like the scent, although I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s something really special or unusual.  I love the bottle, but it&#x27;s a bit disappointing because in all the ads they show it on a stand, but it doesn&#x27;t come with one.  I talked to the seller I purchased this from and he went out of his way to locate one, and couldn&#x27;t.  There aren&#x27;t any.  Perhaps in a store display, but not in a gift set of a single bottle.  I purchased this though Discount Sellers here on Amazon and got the best deal, as well as the best customer service I have ever had.</li>
            <li> She loved it and I get to reap the benefits!  Best gift that she received.  She liked the gift set more than the vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. A very nice set for yourself or gift giving. Beautifully packaged. Item arrived early, awesome! Item was packaged very well, no dents or scratches in box, which is nice if it were given as a gift. I would absolutely buy from this vendor/seller again &amp; again!</li>
            <li> 5/5!(: DONT BUY THIS AT STORES... I bought this item at Kohls the 1.7Fl for $49.99 plus tax! I thought it was a ripoff at stores.. Then I found it on amazon the bigger perfume and a little one PLUS lotion and shower gel for half the price.. 29.99$ like what a deal!  What can you say amazing! And the box is so pretty hope this was helpful (:</li>
            <li> Great price and great shipping.  This item was hard to find a Christmas time, but not only was I able to get it for my daughter, the price was outstanding in comparison to local stores.  I saved more than $ 14.00.  The perfume has a nice sent and is endorsed by the &amp;#34;Queen&amp;#34; of the music charts Katy Perry.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Exactly as described. Great price for size of perfume and lotions</li>
            <li> This gift set is very attractive and appealing to the eye. The bottles look like ornaments. It was also a great value for the money I paid as it offered 4 full sized items in the set. I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of smelling it yet as it is a desired gift for my daughter so I&#x27;ll have to wait for Christmas to get a sniff.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance! GREAT VALUE! The soap made me break out however, but I have sensitive skin. WIll be buying again. I get tons of complements whenever I wear this.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and get compliments all the time.  Great as a gift also. This was cheaper than the sale price in the store. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very great perfume can easly make a stand out of an egg dipper from an easter egg kit also that would be super cute!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my wife loves it, love the scent,  and happy with this perfume from the great performer Katy Perry!</li>
            <li> This was first Christmas to have new daughter in law. I got this perfume and she loves it. Wears all the time.</li>
            <li> My wife thought it was excellent.  The larger bottle looks really cool on the dresser.  The color is very eye-catching.</li>
            <li> Great price. Delivered on time. Katy Perry &amp;#34;killer queen, 4 piece gift set is ideal. I take the small perfume in my purse. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the Katy and the seller.</li>
            <li> This combination is an excellent value and of course it smells great.  I was surprised at the size considering a single bottle of Killer Queen goes for about $45 dollars or more at the department stores.  If you are a fan of Pop Queen Katy Perry then this is just the ticket!!</li>
            <li> I love that I get 2 bottles of perfume with this gift set! Especially one that is so big, which means it last longer, Yay! Also, the scent is bold, and spicy, which is the kind of scent I enjoy wearing most.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and the box set is a awesome buy. I would recommend this perfume and box set to everyone.</li>
            <li> I first came in contact with this perfume at work from a coworker who had a sampler in her pocket. Good stuff and I just became addicted to it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. The box it came in is very nice and can be used for a storage box.</li>
            <li> Bottles are unique, look pretty scattered around on a glass tray, good value, love price, and free shipping always is such a good thing!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for several years. I was very pleased with this particular product. It arrived before the expected dated. It was in perfect condition and was exactly like the description. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> my new favorite perfume a lot for the value. very happy with my gift!!! prominent smell but still subtle, the bottle is gorgeous</li>
            <li> Unbeatable price, lovely smell. A bit more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; than her Purr and Meow scents but I love those as well.</li>
            <li> This perfume is gorgeous! I wanted it last year when it first came out, but it was expensive at the department store. Such a bargain! And if anyone is wondering if it&#x27;s real, it is! It&#x27;s exactly the same gift box they sell in the department store.</li>
            <li> Lovely and elegant. Shame there arent stands like at stores. Friend and i sampled and she got a gift set for valentines and offered me the little bottle. I still think ill be purchasing for the lotion and other goodies at some point in near future. 5 hours intocwearimg and still decent and light scent. A reapply might be needed but youll enjoy pulling out such a unique bottle</li>
            <li> This was an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance and got complements. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Same as in picture. I feel I spent too much for it after shopping around. Will be a gift so I don&#x27;t know how the smell is or how long it lasts for.</li>
            <li> very nice perfume set i really loved it and it smells great very nice if your a katy perry fan</li>
            <li> Love it wear it all the time. Another perfume to my collection. Very happy. I get compliments al the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, i was supprised at how good it smelled,&lt;br /&gt;It doesent  smell cheap great buy</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells great! Reasonable price! Actually bought for my Mother in law for Christmas, than I smelled it and fell in love with it and immediately ordered me one.  :)</li>
            <li> My husband got this set for me for Christmas and we were both a little hesitant because he rarely likes any female perfumes. He likes this one and was surprised that he smells so good. I love it. The bottle is really cool looking and sits well on the dresser. I love the smaller one, perfect size to put in my purse. Haven&#x27;t used the body wash yet but I&#x27;ve used the lotion and it&#x27;s the same scent. Sometimes the scent can be different between the perfume and lotion. Not this one. The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Still happy with it! I will be getting this again when I run low!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled in a while I love because its not as strong as and it&#x27;s a very fresh scent soon as I run out it will be replaced</li>
            <li> Shower gel &amp; body lotion both caused a rash.</li>
            <li> For the price this is amazing. I bought just the small bottle at a Fred Meyer and it was $40 on its own and for $10 less you get a big bottle and little one and then some! Love it</li>
            <li> Great price. My daughter loves this set.</li>
            <li> This gift set was for my 12 yr old daughter. She loves everything about this set especially the cool bottles.</li>
            <li> Love love love it .. the smell is perfect</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great deal! Bottle is a work of art on your vanity.</li>
            <li> item received in time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Best price I have ever found. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I got a better deal buying the killer queen from this seller vs any store near me! Thank you it&#x27;s brand new everything is perfect and so much purfume for the price!</li>
            <li> Love how this set comes!  Awesome box and great price for what comes in it.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time my wife loved it!</li>
