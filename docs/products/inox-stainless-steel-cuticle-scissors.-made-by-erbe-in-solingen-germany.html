            <li>And of course, the best manicure scissors made come from Germany.</li>
            <li>The perfect cuticle scissor!  </li>
            <li>excellent.</li>
            <li>As always, very good quality.</li>
            <li>I cannot find anything like these anywhere in my  city and when I discovered them on Amazon, I was really happy.  </li>
            <li>Great cuticle scissors.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>These are very impressive compared to the drugstore version that I had for years, which finally gave out because the screw holding it together disintegrated.  </li>
            <li>Amazon czrries better ones if you want to pay more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
            <li>works pretty good, but was expecting it to be more fine/sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, easy to use, my best scissors ever.</li>
            <li>These cuticle scissors appear fine at the point, but do NOT cut cuticles.</li>
            <li>The slim pointy edges are perfect for cuticles and they are super sharp.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see that happening to this pair, since it is made in Germany and has the look and feel of a precise surgical instrument.  </li>
            <li>Better than most but longer blades than I expected  and not as able to cut in close places.</li>
            <li>These are great little scissors</li>
            <li>This costs more than a drugstore-type pair but it should last for decades.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth typing this much.</li>
            <li>My wife certainly enjoys these scissors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a pretty steady hand, but still had a couple of &amp;#34;gotcha&amp;#34; type moments.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good thin manicure scissor and these are really great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky...and this one really gets the job done</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>tight places...cuts very cleanly, as well.</li>
            <li>Nice scissors with thin scissor blades forming the pointed tip.  </li>
            <li>So hard to find a fine tip that cuts well.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re sharp enough and the finger holes are big enough for me (wear a men&#x27;s large size glove).</li>

            <li> they&#x27;re sharp enough and the finger holes are big enough for me (wear a men&#x27;s large size glove).</li>
            <li> have been real careful to leave them in a mesh type compartment of the kit and aired out, but they&#x27;re rusting up.</li>
            <li> Sharp and solid quality.</li>
            <li> They replaced an older scissors that had become quite dull.  </li>
            <li> The two holes for your fingers are generous enough, unlike the drugstore version I just bought which had such tiny finger holes that I could barely get two female fingers into them (and shall be used from now on for cutting coupons).</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but the tips could be thinner.</li>
            <li> already seeing rust develop in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> Very sharp with very little depth, so can cut&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell from the photo, but the tips are extremely narrow.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly thin and sharp cuticle scissors!</li>
            <li> Scissors are dull, and there was a burr on one of the blades.  </li>
            <li> use them as nose hair clippers and they&#x27;re quite dangerous with the sharp tip.</li>
            <li> Very dull.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality or quality control.  </li>
            <li> I can hold these in either hand and maneuver them where they need to go for cutting with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!  </li>

I cannot find anything like these anywhere in my  city and when I discovered them on Amazon, I was really happy.  These are great little scissors and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Scissors are dull, and there was a burr on one of the blades.  Very poor quality or quality control.  Definitely not $30 scissors.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, easy to use, my best scissors ever. Using it for nails and cuticles trimming.</li>
            <li> These are very impressive compared to the drugstore version that I had for years, which finally gave out because the screw holding it together disintegrated.  I can&#x27;t see that happening to this pair, since it is made in Germany and has the look and feel of a precise surgical instrument.  This costs more than a drugstore-type pair but it should last for decades.  Also, it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell from the photo, but the tips are extremely narrow.

            <li> These cuticle scissors appear fine at the point, but do NOT cut cuticles. The blades do not get close enough to the skin to trim</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  Very dull.  I returned them immediately.  Not even worth typing this much.</li>
            <li> The perfect cuticle scissor!  I&#x27;m picky...and this one really gets the job done RIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;Order it... you will not be disappointed!  Very sharp with very little depth, so can cut&lt;br /&gt;in tight places...cuts very cleanly, as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for years. As always, very good quality. Expect not to have to get another one for another 5-7years</li>
            <li> Got them for my mother. She loves them. So hard to find a fine tip that cuts well.</li>
            <li> Great cuticle scissors.  The slim pointy edges are perfect for cuticles and they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> My wife certainly enjoys these scissors.  They replaced an older scissors that had become quite dull.  Not inexpensive but cheaper than they would have been on the German market.</li>
            <li> already seeing rust develop in less than 2 months. have taken these in a toiletry kit a couple times. have been real careful to leave them in a mesh type compartment of the kit and aired out, but they&#x27;re rusting up. they&#x27;re sharp enough and the finger holes are big enough for me (wear a men&#x27;s large size glove). use them as nose hair clippers and they&#x27;re quite dangerous with the sharp tip. I&#x27;ve got a pretty steady hand, but still had a couple of &amp;#34;gotcha&amp;#34; type moments. wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for nose hair trimming.</li>
            <li> Amazingly thin and sharp cuticle scissors!</li>
            <li> excellent. Sharp and solid quality. Worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Amazon czrries better ones if you want to pay more.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but the tips could be thinner.</li>
            <li> Better than most but longer blades than I expected  and not as able to cut in close places. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> works pretty good, but was expecting it to be more fine/sharp. that is why I looked for a pair made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors with thin scissor blades forming the pointed tip.  The thinness of the blade makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> These are well made and quite short cuticle scissors.  I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
