            <li>you enjoy Zum as much as I do</li>
            <li>Just started using this 3 days ago &amp; so far the results have been outstanding,I am actually able to sit and watch TV at night without uncontrollable burning in my feet from Diabetic Neuropathy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#2- Love the ingredients also include shea, grape seed oil and a lot of natural&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>It is packed full of natural, high quality, healthy, holistic medicine.</li>
            <li>I tested it to make sure it was the Zum Rub, and sure enough - the eczema disappeared one complete day after the stoppage of use.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s a Large tin!</li>
            <li>The product arrived as described and very fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I like how it feels and it sinks in nicely</li>
            <li>Very fragrant!  </li>
            <li>Bought it because F&amp;M is good for chronic pain and usually the smell is not unbearable, but this one is.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing Zum products have worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;The price in my opinion is not a factor considering it is high quality and completely natural</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for quite a few years and LOVE IT!    </li>
            <li>It is soothing and healing, a real find.</li>
            <li>My cuts and scrapes heal fast.  </li>
            <li>The smell was very earthy and calming.  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on very greasy and stays greasy.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for problems you might have.  </li>
            <li>I like the consistancy very well but not so much the scent.</li>
            <li>Really softens up anywhere</li>
            <li>She said that it really helped to restore her skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>This is an unusual fragrance, one that marks &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really works well for both body aches and migraines.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Zum Rub because I had purchased other Zum products and love the Frankincnse &amp; Myrrh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is a little greasey at first but soaks in quickly to leave your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>this rub does, leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li>Kinda reminds me of the old butch wax that I plastered on my hair back in the mid 50s, except it smells better.</li>
            <li>Now I know why these spices have been popular for at least 2000 years.</li>
            <li>I have even heard tell that this particular product works for clearing adult acne, but this is not scientifically proven.</li>
            <li>it is so real and natural without freaky skanky smell - it smells wonderful and works on cold dry hands like nothing I have ever found.</li>
            <li>How surprised was I when the area started to heal almost over night?!  </li>
            <li>Get this stuff and suffer no more :)</li>
            <li>No chemicals and leaves my hands &amp; feet so soft for the winter!</li>
            <li>Over all, there are no ingredients in this product that can not be pronounced by a ten year old, which really means that you won&#x27;t find toxic chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li>Three days - completely</li>
            <li>I 1st purchased it near Gruene TX on the river at a shop where tubers go -     </li>
            <li>The scent is neither masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li>soft, supple.</li>
            <li>I have given up on anything that isn&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li>I love Zum products, but I wasn&#x60;t expecting a thick, greasy</li>
            <li>I put a little amount on my feet and legs and instantly it feels smooth and</li>
            <li>It does absorb after awhile and really helps very dry hands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I personally hate the strong scent of perfume, but I love the scent of Zum Rub.</li>
            <li>Its feels refreshing and soothing when applied, but above all, I&#x27;m addicted to the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had this dry skin/rash area on my chin that is a direct result of stress &amp; tried this on it, figuring it couldn&#x27;t hurt (nothing else was helping at this point).  </li>

            <li> Zum Rub is a quick seller.</li>
            <li> I love it, especially in winter, and this is a highly moisturizing balm, which makes it even better (my feet thank Zum!)</li>
            <li> Wear as solid perfume love the scent!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not a cure,it is such a noticeable improvement that I am re-ordering 3 more cans immediately!</li>
            <li> fragrance was fine, but I really haven&#x60;t used this at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great little can of goodness</li>
            <li> you enjoy Zum as much as I do</li>
            <li> Just started using this 3 days ago &amp; so far the results have been outstanding,I am actually able to sit and watch TV at night without uncontrollable burning in my feet from Diabetic Neuropathy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#2- Love the ingredients also include shea, grape seed oil and a lot of natural&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li> It is packed full of natural, high quality, healthy, holistic medicine.</li>
            <li> I tested it to make sure it was the Zum Rub, and sure enough - the eczema disappeared one complete day after the stoppage of use.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s a Large tin!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as described and very fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I like how it feels and it sinks in nicely</li>
            <li> Very fragrant!  </li>
            <li> Bought it because F&amp;M is good for chronic pain and usually the smell is not unbearable, but this one is.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing Zum products have worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;The price in my opinion is not a factor considering it is high quality and completely natural</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years and LOVE IT!    </li>
            <li> It is soothing and healing, a real find.</li>
            <li> My cuts and scrapes heal fast.  </li>
            <li> The smell was very earthy and calming.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes on very greasy and stays greasy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for problems you might have.  </li>
            <li> I like the consistancy very well but not so much the scent.</li>
            <li> Really softens up anywhere</li>
            <li> She said that it really helped to restore her skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is an unusual fragrance, one that marks &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really works well for both body aches and migraines.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Zum Rub because I had purchased other Zum products and love the Frankincnse &amp; Myrrh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasey at first but soaks in quickly to leave your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> this rub does, leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Kinda reminds me of the old butch wax that I plastered on my hair back in the mid 50s, except it smells better.</li>
            <li> Now I know why these spices have been popular for at least 2000 years.</li>
            <li> I have even heard tell that this particular product works for clearing adult acne, but this is not scientifically proven.</li>
            <li> it is so real and natural without freaky skanky smell - it smells wonderful and works on cold dry hands like nothing I have ever found.</li>
            <li> How surprised was I when the area started to heal almost over night?!  </li>
            <li> Get this stuff and suffer no more :)</li>
            <li> No chemicals and leaves my hands &amp; feet so soft for the winter!</li>
            <li> Over all, there are no ingredients in this product that can not be pronounced by a ten year old, which really means that you won&#x27;t find toxic chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li> Three days - completely</li>
            <li> I 1st purchased it near Gruene TX on the river at a shop where tubers go -     </li>
            <li> The scent is neither masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li> soft, supple.</li>
            <li> I have given up on anything that isn&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> I love Zum products, but I wasn&#x60;t expecting a thick, greasy</li>
            <li> I put a little amount on my feet and legs and instantly it feels smooth and</li>
            <li> It does absorb after awhile and really helps very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I personally hate the strong scent of perfume, but I love the scent of Zum Rub.</li>
            <li> Its feels refreshing and soothing when applied, but above all, I&#x27;m addicted to the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had this dry skin/rash area on my chin that is a direct result of stress &amp; tried this on it, figuring it couldn&#x27;t hurt (nothing else was helping at this point).  </li>
            <li> Have to really rub it hard to get enough warmth to get it up to apply.  </li>
            <li> I initially went to purchase the dragons blood rub since I have horribly dry, scaly, ashy legs and feet.</li>
            <li> The water here in Afghanistan is very hard on skin and hair - it makes everything super dry.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of frankincense and myrrh lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> Its a little oily when applied, so I usually like to use it right before bed.</li>
            <li> Even though I use this product and it helps dry skin</li>
            <li> However, in the winter I do keep it with me at work though to apply to my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It has solved the problem of cracked, dry, sore hands and heels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m itching less from dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of the other Zum F &amp; M scented products.  </li>
            <li> This product I am not able to use daily after every hand wash because believe it or not, my eczema flared up.  </li>
            <li> I used this nightly on my arms and legs, and the very rough patches on my elbows and heels went away!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish the container was a little smaller/lighter so that it wasn&#x27;t so heavy to carry around in my purse.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed - besides the fantastic, soothing scent, it&#x27;s like a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too oily to use throughout the day for me, so I use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I admit, I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type products but am slowly getting used to their consistency and feel by using this and</li>
            <li> Be careful though a little goes along way!!!</li>
            <li> I had a small sample of the frankincense and myrrh body rub before</li>
            <li> but a bit hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> The smell is kinda weird, reminds me of the old avon Skin so soft product or some mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like products that do that, but this one actually works and it doesn&#x27;t feel nasty to me like other greasy products do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Kinda reminds me of the old butch wax that I plastered on my hair back in the mid 50s, except it smells better. I prefer the Frankincense &amp; Myrrh oil for rubbing on my feet and toes. But this will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this rub for feet suffering from the effects of chemotherapy.  It is soothing and healing, a real find.</li>
            <li> I love Zum Rub products. The Frankincense and Myrrh scented hand rub has a great smell and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It also feels great on my hands, not oily or slimy after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> We really like this product for our dry skin and the bonus is that it smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Like it. Pretty strong smell. Doesn&#x27;t seem to deplete too quickly. I would recommend this. There are a number of variates as well.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  Smells fantastic - very clean and soothing.  My feet are so soft after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the compact container I can carry in my purse for portable use. Smells lovely and I use it on my nails and cuticles. It&#x27;s greasy at first but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought it because F&amp;M is good for chronic pain and usually the smell is not unbearable, but this one is. It also goes on a bit greasy. I&#x27;d worry about it staining clothing.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and good stuff besides.</li>
            <li> My hands and arms love this rub.  I put it on night and day.  My cuts and scrapes heal fast.  I&#x27;m itching less from dry skin.  My skin feels silky and smoother.  Love the scent.  Not as strong as &#x27;Opium&#x27; but close.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the other Zum F &amp; M scented products.  This scent to me is the most soothing, so I wanted to give this item a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed - besides the fantastic, soothing scent, it&#x27;s like a miracle cream.  I had this dry skin/rash area on my chin that is a direct result of stress &amp; tried this on it, figuring it couldn&#x27;t hurt (nothing else was helping at this point).  How surprised was I when the area started to heal almost over night?!  Three days - completely healed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great little can of goodness I keep in my purse &amp; use almost every day!  Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years and LOVE IT!    I 1st purchased it near Gruene TX on the river at a shop where tubers go -     I even found it on Maui when I lived there - however - the last year I lived there - the store stopped carrying it - and I have found the same here in Houston TX where the store stopped carrying it as well- I used to google for it occasionally - no luck UNTIL NOW!!    I love this stuff b/c it is so real and natural without freaky skanky smell - it smells wonderful and works on cold dry hands like nothing I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve relied on Zum Rub in the driest of the midwest&#x27;s winters in repairing the cracked&#x27;est of chemical-exposed, moisture-depleted hands... nothing else I have ever, ever tried can compare.  This stuff ain&#x27;t nuthin&#x27; but goodness: plant oils, shea butter, carnauba wax, goat&#x27;s milk, vitamin E &amp; essential oils that also serve as fragrance... all in a tin that is perfectly purse sized (and airplane-carry-on acceptable)!  To boot, I *love* the Frankincense &amp; Myrrh scent best of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m about out of the almond scent, and can&#x27;t wait to get a replacement F&amp;M scent.  Fear no longer, cracked-cuticle-girl!  Appease your itchies, poison-ivy-boy!  Get this stuff and suffer no more :)</li>
            <li> Seem to be helping reduce foot pain at night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!! Organic, all natural , essential oils all come together to form this wonderful rub that has so many benefits, and uses. It&#x27;s a moisturizer, a makeup remover, it heals scars quickly, it can be used in the hair to control frizz. I initially purchased it to help with my neuropathy in my feet and legs but honestly I use it for all the above, lol.  I did however find a product that I LOVE for the neuropathy it is called Penetrex also purchased through Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I had a small sample of the frankincense and myrrh body rub before and I absolutely loved it.  The smell was very earthy and calming.  I admit, I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type products but am slowly getting used to their consistency and feel by using this and Badger balm products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of frankincense and myrrh lasts a really long time and I have had a lot of compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> my husband has Diabetic neuropathy. I bought this for him to rub on his feet and he is very happy with the results. It softens the skin to prevent cracking and he likes the unique scent.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great hand moisturizer in my favorite scent, Frankincense &amp; Myrrh. It&#x27;s a little too oily to use throughout the day for me, so I use it every night before I go to bed. It does absorb after awhile and really helps very dry hands. If used sparingly it is fine for daytime.</li>
            <li> Zum Rub is good health in a pocket tin. It is packed full of natural, high quality, healthy, holistic medicine. Zum rub is great for sunburned skin, dry, cracked heels and elbows, chapped skin and makes a wonderful face cream. I love the &amp;#34;biblical&amp;#34; scent of the Frankincense and Myrrh. The scent is neither masculine or feminine. It is a wonderful natural scent suitable for both men and women. The scent is lite and not overpowering. I personally hate the strong scent of perfume, but I love the scent of Zum Rub. Zum Rub is a quick seller. I am so glad Amazon carries this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love the price, time received them, great for christmas they were rapped great. Very Happy with them.Thanks I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Zum&amp;#34; line of products.  It is so different than just the regular products out there.  Nice to have a unique scent.  I use this for my hands, sometimes lotion just isn&#x27;t hydrating enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on very greasy and stays greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for problems you might have.  Maybe if you want something that does what I mentioned then it&#x27;s fine.  It does smell pretty good.  Not too strong or anything but what&#x27;s the purpose?</li>
            <li> I like how it feels and it sinks in nicely but it is very strong smelling at first. Don&#x27;t know if I will purchase again for that reason.</li>
            <li> Now I know why these spices have been popular for at least 2000 years. They smell great together and the lotion is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I initially went to purchase the dragons blood rub since I have horribly dry, scaly, ashy legs and feet. The store was out so I bought this and it works AMAZINGLY! I put a little amount on my feet and legs and instantly it feels smooth and calming.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product is does have a \\&quot;grease\\&quot; to it while it soaks in, it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy at all. I don&#x27;t usually like products that do that, but this one actually works and it doesn&#x27;t feel nasty to me like other greasy products do.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing Zum products have worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;The price in my opinion is not a factor considering it is high quality and completely natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy Zum as much as I do</li>
            <li> This rub is ok. The smell is kinda weird, reminds me of the old avon Skin so soft product or some mosquito repellent. I like the consistancy very well but not so much the scent. The product arrived as described and very fast.</li>
            <li> soft, supple. good response from my feet. pleasant odor lasts al day even inside soes in summer heat</li>
            <li> Love this rub. Smells real nice. Really softens up anywhere I put it. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I never used a rub before. I think I will stick to lotion. Even though I use this product and it helps dry skin</li>
            <li> Wear as solid perfume love the scent! Woodsy scent &amp; easy to control.</li>
            <li> Very nice after the bath! Sensuous and sublime.</li>
            <li> Nice product that smells great. Lasts a while before you have to reapply. I will be ordering the body mist soon.</li>
            <li> smells so good, makes your skin feel really soft, nice</li>
            <li> Brought this for my aunt who was under chemo therapy treatment. She was very happy and amazed with the results. She said that it really helped to restore her skin.</li>
            <li> this rub does, leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> The water here in Afghanistan is very hard on skin and hair - it makes everything super dry. I used this nightly on my arms and legs, and the very rough patches on my elbows and heels went away! I also used it on the ends of my hair and on chapped lips. Bonus: it smells great. I am ordering more for myself so it&#x27;ll be waiting for me at home in the States. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Such a luffly smell and texture. My fave of all time. Great for feet too, super emollient.</li>
            <li> Their products are top notch.  Have used for years and love</li>
            <li> I get compliments on the scent all the time, and my skin loves it too. We use it on hands and super chapped lips, as well as fly away strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I love Zum products, but I wasn&#x60;t expecting a thick, greasy product.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was fine, but I really haven&#x60;t used this at all.</li>
            <li> Zum Rub Body Moisturizer Frankincense and Myrrh -- 2.5 oz -I love the smell of it .  Buy it and try it.</li>
            <li> This product I am not able to use daily after every hand wash because believe it or not, my eczema flared up.  I tested it to make sure it was the Zum Rub, and sure enough - the eczema disappeared one complete day after the stoppage of use.  I do use it for the ends of my hair - and I love it.  Therefore, this is what I use it for.  If you do not experience contact dermatitis from scents - then go for it.  You will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Just started using this 3 days ago &amp; so far the results have been outstanding,I am actually able to sit and watch TV at night without uncontrollable burning in my feet from Diabetic Neuropathy.While it&#x27;s not a cure,it is such a noticeable improvement that I am re-ordering 3 more cans immediately!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the way this stuff smells. Its really great for dry, chapped hands and elbows, but I have also used it on my cuticles, on my lips (where I can smell how good it smells even longer), and on my feet. I have also used it on my neck and chest to help me relax and fall asleep at night. Its a little oily when applied, so I usually like to use it right before bed. However, in the winter I do keep it with me at work though to apply to my dry hands. Its feels refreshing and soothing when applied, but above all, I&#x27;m addicted to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish the container was a little smaller/lighter so that it wasn&#x27;t so heavy to carry around in my purse.</li>
            <li> Received my 1st. order of Frankincense and Myrrh Rub -&lt;br /&gt;#1 - Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;#2- Love the ingredients also include shea, grape seed oil and a lot of natural&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Price was great&lt;br /&gt;Will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Frankincense and Myrrh is my favorite scent.  I love the way this feels and absorbs into my skin.  It has solved the problem of cracked, dry, sore hands and heels.  I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> FABULOUS! This is an unusual fragrance, one that marks &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;you&amp;#34;. I love it, especially in winter, and this is a highly moisturizing balm, which makes it even better (my feet thank Zum!)</li>
            <li> works fast and smells good</li>
            <li> This product is a bit greasy, and smell a bit strong for my taste. HOWEVER, am happy to report works greats on hangnails, and cuticles.</li>
            <li> but a bit hard to apply.  Have to really rub it hard to get enough warmth to get it up to apply.  It is not fluid at all, but seems to do the job once it get on.  And it really is my favorite scent from them</li>
            <li> Love the Zum products. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Zum Rub is amazing..... All natural ingredients and the smell - AWESOME! I don&#x27;t leave home without Zum Rub!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to try it.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant!  Speedy service!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Awe... Frankincense &amp; Myrrh - My favorite.  I have given up on anything that isn&#x27;t natural.  Best product around!  No chemicals and leaves my hands &amp; feet so soft for the winter!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for the skin, great for healing cuts or abrasions. Great for soothing irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Smells so good &amp; it&#x27;s a Large tin!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help My razor burn after u shave, this has really helped!!!! Be careful though a little goes along way!!! So if you use to much you feel greasy, but it keeps my skin silky and bump free!!! I love this!</li>
            <li> I use Frankincense and Myrrh in many forms for pain control. It really works well for both body aches and migraines. Zum Rub is especially effective for rubbing over neck and muscle pain. The smell is wonderful and the pain melts away. I have even heard tell that this particular product works for clearing adult acne, but this is not scientifically proven. Over all, there are no ingredients in this product that can not be pronounced by a ten year old, which really means that you won&#x27;t find toxic chemicals in this product. The only caution is for those who might be allergic to any of the components, but even those are generally low allergen type ingredients.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for my daughter... Will be buying more ... She loves it... So do I.</li>
            <li> like this rub. it is sort of a vaseline type consistency. feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Zum Rub because I had purchased other Zum products and love the Frankincnse &amp; Myrrh fragrance.  I love the smell!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, it smells great and really leaves my hands feeling soft.  It is a little greasey at first but soaks in quickly to leave your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as a homeopathic remedy on Dr.  Oz.  I have used it on my on my knee at bed time.  It seems to make movement more comfortable.</li>
