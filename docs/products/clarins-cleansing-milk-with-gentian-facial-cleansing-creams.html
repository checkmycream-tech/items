    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is not as harsh as a product that leather, but I get very oily during the day and can cause some breakout.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought the Dior Cleansing Milk with Iris Extract which worked really good on my skin.  I purchased this afterward hoping to find a less expensive version cleansing milk.  For some reason this does not work for my skin and leaves behind a strong aftershave type smell.  I have a really oily complexion and this didn&#x27;t help and I had more breakouts from this.</li>
            <li> Products arrived promptly and as described.  I have used this product for years.  It is very good for combination skin.</li>
            <li> This toning lotion can be used in connection with cleaning milk on the skin.  The combination of these two will make the skin feel outstanding and protect it.  Many people just use regular soap, but to take care of the face and skin this is the best, for feeling and protection.</li>
            <li> Great product works better than I thought. A+++</li>
            <li> It really cleans the skin and isn&#x27;t as aggressive compared to other products that dry your skin out. I think this product is best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I must say this cleanser is great for Oily Skin.  Shouldn&#x27;t make you break out.  Did a great job of cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It is wonderful and keeps my skin hydrated and even toned. I used to get blotches of dry skin in the winter but now my face is soft and even all year round. It works best if coupled with moisturizer but I don&#x27;t even use real expensive moisturizer any more since this works so well.</li>

            <li> The smell is way too strong and even in a 2 cleanse system, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin but leave a bit of a film.</li>
            <li> I love this! I usually use this with the Clarisonic brush. My face glows and looks healthy and has never felt so soft and smooth! I have used it without the brush a few times and haven&#x27;t notices an issue with my makeup coming off, however I don&#x27;t wear much makeup. My skin is normally fairly sensitive and I battle small breakouts constantly. It&#x27;s only been about a week since I got this, but so far so good! It is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Before switching to Clarins I would have breakouts and my skin was hard to manage. I swear by this stuff, never using another face wash again!</li>
            <li> Conratulations, excellent supplier again for a good business with him, poi everything reported was correct and this is very good</li>
            <li> I like this product; I&#x27;ve been using it for six weeks.  My face does not get as oily as it use to and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel too dry.</li>
            <li> It is easily able to remove all the makeup. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated &amp; moisturized. And it smells like rose water. I love it.</li>
            <li> It seems okay. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;m not a fan of the cleansing milk. My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean after, probably because of the moisturizing effect of the product. However, I know it does cleanse my face. I&#x27;m just used to a different kind of facial cleansing product.</li>
            <li> It is good for me! anyone buy it need to use it exactly following the instruction, or you will waste it. It really good for deep clean. I recommend to use it one-two times per week, not everyday.</li>
            <li> love clarins always have and always will</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than predicted and works very well on my combination skin. I have no reactions or dryness while usin the product twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have keep using this cleansing milk since 2009, and it is the best for my oily skin, it just sucks all the oil out and make the skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks and I had noticed a difference in my skin. Love this!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product &amp; company!</li>
            <li> In the past, I wanted my face to feel tight after I washed it. I used foams and gels that lathered to get every ounce of oil off my face. Afterwards I&#x27;d burn my skin with alcohol based astringents and salicylic infused lotions. I had acne and was taught that washing your face was just an unpleasant experience that I had to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw several dermatologists, and all they did was prescribe me more acne medications. One day I just said \\&quot;Enough!\\&quot; and started looking at other options. It turns out that I was allergic to sulfur/sulfates and the foaming cleansers were the cause of my acne. Once I switched over to Clarins cleansing milk, my skin evened out and all my acne disappeared. Now I don&#x27;t have to use foundation anymore-just a dab of tinted moisturizer! Maybe you secretly have a skin allergy as well but you just never knew? This product changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you wear a lot of makeup (long wearing or waterproof), I&#x27;d recommend using cold cream to remove the excess and then washing your face with the cleansing milk as usual. Using the Clarins iris toner after washing removes extra residue as well.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasure shopping experience.This product is very smooth and helpful.I bought it when it has discount, It is worth for.</li>
            <li> Having combination oily skin, I was worried that a cleansing milk won&#x27;t be enough to prevent breakout. However, This cleanser proved me wrong. Nice cleanser to slowly massage into my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the cleansing milk, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. Everything else does...but this is perfect so far.</li>
            <li> If you use this milk correctly, you will see dirt and blackheads extracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is effective and yet gentle, but should not be used too frequently. Otherwise it over-dries. My oily skin is turned to be dry, flaky around mouth area especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. instructions enclosed in package is a bit misleading. You have to repeat as instructed for 5-6 min.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give above 1 star to a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t remove makeup. I will use it up in the morning since the makeup will have been washed off the night before with another product.</li>
            <li> I am loving this cleanser.  It is perfect for these winter months when a little extra moisture is needed.  I have combination skin and it is the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Love it and getting it without going to a mall.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and light on my face. Light scent. Have bought several times. Use with my Clarisonic brush. Cleans and does not dry my face.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and combination, sensitive skin. I was previously using another gentle cleanser for rosacea but it was really drying out my skin. This one does not leave my skin very dry and is very gentle. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanig milk, if you use it step by step,20 minutes later, you will see dirt and blackheads extracted. I always use it 2 times a week. It‘s amazing for me.</li>
