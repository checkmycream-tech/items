            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is the most amazing</li>
            <li>so I could moisturize more effectively with lip balm.</li>

            <li>:) i will definatly be purchasing this again when i run out :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is not only absolutely delicious</li>
            <li>In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for chapped/dry lips especially in the winter season.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product compared to it&#x27;s leading competition.</li>
            <li>They are very smooth and soft, and it tastes really good!</li>
            <li>Love how silky smooth my lips feel after.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled to get it and put it on right away.  </li>
            <li>So sweet!</li>
            <li>It is creamy and light, great for maintaining soft lips.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>only good thing I can say about this product, is that it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>The only positive is that it smells good (doesn&#x27;t taste that great though).</li>
            <li>It gives a nice gentle scrub and then the oils leave your lips moist.</li>
            <li>but as you rub it on the crystals polish your lips, leaving them smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my lips feel as smooth as they did after using this product.</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients in this product are fine except \\&quot;flavor.\\&quot; The ingredients are: \\&quot;Organic Sugar, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Carthamus Tinctorius(Safflower Oil), Canola Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Prunus Armeniaca</li>
            <li>Worth the $!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>The taste is not as sweet as I thought it would be and honestly it tastes more like regular body lotion.</li>
            <li>In fact we all tried it and its sweet like Vanilla candy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this lip scrub more highly!</li>
            <li>I really thought it would&#x27;ve been more abrasive because of the organic sugar that is in it.</li>
            <li>After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant, and my lips have been like the Sahara -</li>
            <li>Great product, but the oil leaked out of the cap when it was tightly wrapped in the plastic it came in.  </li>
            <li>It works decently enough but not any better than table sugar and honey that I can make at home for really cheap.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my lips feeling so soft &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really do not think lip scrubs are good for you.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your lips super ultra soft and it smells fabulous .</li>
            <li>and since I have full lips I had to buy so much lip moisturizing products that are not working .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be using more of this definitely .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally gotten better results by just using spit.</li>
            <li>is the first item I&#x27;ve ever considered</li>
            <li>My chapped lips seemed pretty hopeless before I used this lip scrub.</li>
            <li>On top of it put an equal amount of oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lip scrub!!</li>
            <li>I used the one my friend has from Lush and it is smooth and immediately sugar dissolves and makes your lips soft , this one has hard sugar crystals that do not do a good job of scrubbing!</li>
            <li>But it is probably to the good that the manufacturer did not employ artificial scent, which has its own</li>
            <li>you are looking for something natural, I suggest making your own scrub from simple ingredients found in your kitchen.  </li>
            <li>If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.d it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this product and seeing as how there is no need to exfoliate your lips daily, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it was important to me to use a product that was both natural and highly</li>
            <li>This scrub makes your lips super soft and smells like candy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips plumper, gives them more color, &amp;&amp; i don&#x27;t have to worry  about dry lips.</li>
            <li>Many things makes them dry and peel.</li>
            <li>This evens out all the skin that wants to peel off.  </li>
            <li>, maybe it works if you don&#x27;t really have a dryness problem, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase this product again when I do run out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do a lot for my lips.</li>
            <li>Works very well and has&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on a product, but I really wanted relief.</li>
            <li>So far, exactly what I was looking for to exfoliate, sooth and condition my chapped peeling lips.</li>
            <li>The product does what it says- makes my dry lips smooth.</li>
            <li>Works decent.</li>
            <li>The juice of a tropical plant prized by the Polynesians for more than 2,000 years for internal and external health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is exfoliating enough to use everyday which I like and because the oils in the product melt while using it is actually pretty moisturizing kind of like lotion for your lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pumpkin seed oil: A natural oil safe for internal as well as external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noni</li>
            <li>Within six months to a year, long before you&#x27;ve used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup).</li>
            <li>Shipping was the issue and hot weather, not the product necessarily.</li>
            <li>Also it seems like a little bit goes a long way, so maybe the fact that it lasts a while will be nice for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so soft</li>
            <li>If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process.</li>
            <li>Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; problem, the smell, color and consistency of this product is very odd, perhaps because natural, raw shea butter doesn&#x27;t in and of itself smell all that good.</li>
            <li>Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions properly and everything, but my lips felt exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend to others only thing is the high price</li>
            <li>Still dry with that layer of dead, chapped skin on top.</li>
            <li>The size of the container is large and a little goes a long way, so the product is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>No matter how much water I&#x27;d drink or lip balm I&#x27;d use, my lips were always dry, cracked and in pain.</li>
            <li>This is not for heavily chapped lips and it is not like the real sugar scrubs that literally feel like straight sugar.</li>
            <li>If I had, I would find tons of natural lip scrubs with the same ingredients for $2-$6.</li>
            <li>I actually thought that lip scrubs will make your lips buttery soft.  </li>
            <li>A natural oil for external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft enough to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sweet almond oil: A natural oil for either internal or external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apricot kernel oil: A natural oil for external use only</li>

            <li> Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is exfoliating enough to use everyday which I like and because the oils in the product melt while using it is actually pretty moisturizing kind of like lotion for your lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pumpkin seed oil: A natural oil safe for internal as well as external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noni</li>
            <li> Within six months to a year, long before you&#x27;ve used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup).</li>
            <li> Shipping was the issue and hot weather, not the product necessarily.</li>
            <li> Also it seems like a little bit goes a long way, so maybe the fact that it lasts a while will be nice for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so soft</li>
            <li> If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process.</li>
            <li> Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; problem, the smell, color and consistency of this product is very odd, perhaps because natural, raw shea butter doesn&#x27;t in and of itself smell all that good.</li>
            <li> Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions properly and everything, but my lips felt exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend to others only thing is the high price</li>
            <li> Still dry with that layer of dead, chapped skin on top.</li>
            <li> The size of the container is large and a little goes a long way, so the product is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> No matter how much water I&#x27;d drink or lip balm I&#x27;d use, my lips were always dry, cracked and in pain.</li>
            <li> This is not for heavily chapped lips and it is not like the real sugar scrubs that literally feel like straight sugar.</li>
            <li> If I had, I would find tons of natural lip scrubs with the same ingredients for $2-$6.</li>
            <li> I actually thought that lip scrubs will make your lips buttery soft.  </li>
            <li> A natural oil for external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft enough to use on a daily basis.  </li>

            <li> This will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by this product&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Specifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar, [[ASIN:B000EA3M4M raw sugar]], or sugar alcohol such as [[ASIN:B001EO6852 xylitol]].</li>
            <li> My lips are very soft and no more dryness .</li>
            <li> I did think it would be bigger its a tiny little thing; regardless I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, flaky lips</li>
            <li> To start off, I have really dry finicky lips.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub after searching for an all-natural, organic lip scrub that would slough off the dry skin on my lips.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with dry lips</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Lip Scrub at a reasonable price and to also says what it does, take off the dead skin cells on your lips without being too harsh on your lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only half way through the jar.</li>
            <li> I even took it to work (at a hair salon) and made all my girls try it and every single one of them loves it!</li>
            <li> So little is used it last forever.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> main issue I have with this product is that it is overpriced and completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I suffer from occasional dry lips and this product made my lips feel worse.  </li>
            <li> This jar is very small because you don&#x27;t necessarily need a lot to scrub your lips.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little tricky to handle without it going inside your mouth, so</li>

            <li> This was not a cheap item</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> My make-up bag will never be missing this scrub.</li>
            <li> so now it is just a waste of my money since I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was complete liquid when I opened it.</li>

            <li> a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar.</li>
            <li> I thought it might at least smell heavenly for what I paid, and I wanted to hurl upon sniffing its contents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out.</li>
            <li> But the smell/taste is a terrible, chemically sweet flavor that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing lipstick on a regular basis and noticed that my lipstick would crack and looked terrible after an hour or two</li>
            <li> I could tell this was not a good product to use and stopped using it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for some relief, but it made my lips worse.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was all-too-excited to purchase this item before checking eBay.</li>
            <li> and I was doubtful that this product would get rid of the dead skin</li>
            <li> Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great ingredient list. Works well. Good taste too if you accidentally ingest some, and it is edible. I don&#x27;t think it is the most amazing, it&#x27;s a little tricky to handle without it going inside your mouth, so I might not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This product was basically sticky sugar on your lips with no results.  I do not recommend.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip scrub that tastes great! Easy to use. Nice container. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I find myself constantly picking and pealing my lips, and constantly applying chapstick. Just one use of this product and my lips feel great! They are very smooth and soft, and it tastes really good! Worth the $!</li>
            <li> this healed my cracked/ chapped lips, taste and smell great! love it! I would definately recommend to others only thing is the high price</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by Kandee Johnson. My lips get really chapped and crack and bleed, and I bought this hoping it would help get the dead skin off so I could moisturize more effectively with lip balm. It works decently enough but not any better than table sugar and honey that I can make at home for really cheap. It does smell and taste amazing though.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a lip scrub and I truly love it  !! It leaves your lips super ultra soft and it smells fabulous . I will be using more of this definitely .</li>
            <li> I love this.  It works and it tastes good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bite my lips.  This evens out all the skin that wants to peel off.  I use it every day.  Great product, but the oil leaked out of the cap when it was tightly wrapped in the plastic it came in.  Probably unavoidable.</li>
            <li> this is so yummy, and good.  It is the best lip scrub evahhhhh!  I will totally be repurchasing this when it gets low.  Don&#x27;t want to ever run out</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me. I followed the directions properly and everything, but my lips felt exactly the same. Still dry with that layer of dead, chapped skin on top. I&#x27;ve personally gotten better results by just using spit. The only positive is that it smells good (doesn&#x27;t taste that great though). Also it seems like a little bit goes a long way, so maybe the fact that it lasts a while will be nice for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, maybe it works if you don&#x27;t really have a dryness problem, but it did nothing for me. I&#x27;ll have to invest in another solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Soft enough to use on a daily basis.  And the plus it smells delicious! So little is used it last forever.</li>
            <li> My lips were chapped I tried this and my lips burned and turned red.  I was hoping for some relief, but it made my lips worse.  This was not a cheap item and I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on a product, but I really wanted relief.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was all-too-excited to purchase this item before checking eBay. If I had, I would find tons of natural lip scrubs with the same ingredients for $2-$6. The container is about 2x2\\&quot;, and I opened it to find a brown, sloshing LIQUID inside. I thought it might at least smell heavenly for what I paid, and I wanted to hurl upon sniffing its contents.&lt;br /&gt;So it must work fantastically and taste great, right?&lt;br /&gt;Upon application, the few clumps of sugar that I scooped up seemingly scratched at my lips, stinging them. And when I went to lick it off, the taste was anything but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first item I&#x27;ve ever considered returning- don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the touch of it. It gives a nice gentle scrub and then the oils leave your lips moist.</li>
            <li> This Lip scrub was on my daughter-in-laws Amazon wish list so I bought it for a stocking stuffer.  She was thrilled to get it and put it on right away.  In fact we all tried it and its sweet like Vanilla candy but as you rub it on the crystals polish your lips, leaving them smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Treat Soft Candy Vanilla Buttercream Lip Scrub with Organic Sugar is one of the best lip scrubs I&#x27;ve ever used. I have extremely dry, flaky lips and I was doubtful that this product would get rid of the dead skin but after using it once, all of the chapping on my lips was gone. I&#x27;ve never had my lips feel as smooth as they did after using this product. I love the taste and smell of vanilla and buttercream, and the taste of this product was also wonderful and the smell is very appealing. The size of the container is large and a little goes a long way, so the product is definitely worth the price. I will absolutely purchase this product again when I do run out. I can&#x27;t recommend this lip scrub more highly!</li>
            <li> This scrub makes your lips super soft and smells like candy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Works decent. But a little but too oily. Doesn&#x27;t really do a lot for my lips. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again at that price</li>
            <li> Great scrub for lips.... Also if u accidentally swallow it , don&#x27;t worry , it is safe ,organic and tastes good :)</li>
            <li> The product does what it says- makes my dry lips smooth. But the smell/taste is a terrible, chemically sweet flavor that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> I used the one my friend has from Lush and it is smooth and immediately sugar dissolves and makes your lips soft , this one has hard sugar crystals that do not do a good job of scrubbing!</li>
            <li> very good product, exactly what I ordered, fast shipping, loved my purchase.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this lip scrub! not only does it taste awesome but it leaves my lips feeling so soft &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product smells delicious!! I love using it and have found that it does a great job of exfoliating and moisturizing my lips. Definitely will repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love it! Smells great and works really well :) i will definatly be purchasing this again when i run out :)</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my lips plumper, gives them more color, &amp;&amp; i don&#x27;t have to worry  about dry lips.</li>
            <li> My chapped lips seemed pretty hopeless before I used this lip scrub. No matter how much water I&#x27;d drink or lip balm I&#x27;d use, my lips were always dry, cracked and in pain. This product is not only absolutely delicious but it&#x27;s left my lips so soft I can&#x27;t even believe it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing lipstick on a regular basis and noticed that my lipstick would crack and looked terrible after an hour or two so I decided to try this scrub to see if it would help...talk about night and day!!! I&#x27;m a little obsessed with it actually. It smells good, tastes great and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. My make-up bag will never be missing this scrub. I even took it to work (at a hair salon) and made all my girls try it and every single one of them loves it! You use the tiniest bit so the jar will last forever! Trust me when I say you won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
            <li> I really do not think lip scrubs are good for you.  I suffer from occasional dry lips and this product made my lips feel worse.  It got to the point where it felt like this product was going to damage my lips.  Whoever thought that exfoliating your lips was a good idea is beyond me.  I actually thought that lip scrubs will make your lips buttery soft.  Instead my lips felt very irritated, sore and completely dried out. I could tell this was not a good product to use and stopped using it immediately.  I think I will just stick with lip balm.</li>
            <li> Love this product! So far, exactly what I was looking for to exfoliate, sooth and condition my chapped peeling lips.</li>
            <li> except that there is a waxy feel to the skin afterward and the following morning had two pimples around the lip area!</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product and seeing as how there is no need to exfoliate your lips daily, it lasts a long time. The problem is that it has grown some sort of mold so now it is just a waste of my money since I can no longer use it. Very disappointed :-/</li>
            <li> It is my favorite scrub, smells good, exfoliates perfectly, and has a pleasant taste of you get some in your mouth. I did think it would be bigger its a tiny little thing; regardless I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help keep my lips smoothe during the&lt;br /&gt;winter months when usually chapped.  Works very well and has&lt;br /&gt;a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my shower. I bought this 4 months ago and I&#x27;m only half way through the jar. Love how silky smooth my lips feel after.</li>
            <li> To start off, I have really dry finicky lips. Many things makes them dry and peel. This lip scrub works amazingly well for me. Its not harsh at all, smells wonderful, and does the trick of moisturizing and exfoliating. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients in this product are fine except \\&quot;flavor.\\&quot; The ingredients are: \\&quot;Organic Sugar, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Carthamus Tinctorius(Safflower Oil), Canola Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot Kernel Oil), Cucurbita Pepo (Pumpkin Seed Oil), Morinda Citrifolia (Noni), Flavor.\\&quot; Below is an explanation of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic sugar: This is presumably refined, white/table sugar (vs \\&quot;raw\\&quot; sugar) from an organic source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter: A natural oil for external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safflower oil: An edible, cooking oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canola Oil: An edible, cooking oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet almond oil: A natural oil for either internal or external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apricot kernel oil: A natural oil for external use only; one of its constituents, amygdalin, is converted to cyanide in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumpkin seed oil: A natural oil safe for internal as well as external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noni: The juice of a tropical plant prized by the Polynesians for more than 2,000 years for internal and external health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: It is not specified whether this is \\&quot;artificial\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; flavor. Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained. In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; problem, the smell, color and consistency of this product is very odd, perhaps because natural, raw shea butter doesn&#x27;t in and of itself smell all that good. But it is probably to the good that the manufacturer did not employ artificial scent, which has its own problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I have with this product is that it is overpriced and completely unnecessary. Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar, [[ASIN:B000EA3M4M raw sugar]], or sugar alcohol such as [[ASIN:B001EO6852 xylitol]]. Add to that an equal amount of any food-grade oil you have on hand in the house, for example: olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil, or coconut oil. One-fourth teaspoon each of granular sugar and oil is enough to do both lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for do-it-yourself exfoliation are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar. On top of it put an equal amount of oil. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Blend the sugar and oil together with the tip of your finger. Rub the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for two-five minutes. Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin. If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process. After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time. And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out. Within six months to a year, long before you&#x27;ve used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup). If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.d it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub after searching for an all-natural, organic lip scrub that would slough off the dry skin on my lips. I am currently pregnant, and my lips have been like the Sahara - it was important to me to use a product that was both natural and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this product, is that it smells nice.  The downside however?  1) It dissolves almost instantly when using it in the shower or bath, or when it comes into contact with water, 2) it leaves a waxy/greasy residue on your mouth after use, and 3) it breaks out the skin around the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something natural, I suggest making your own scrub from simple ingredients found in your kitchen.  Save your money and keep looking for something better!</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by this product&#x27;s texture. I really thought it would&#x27;ve been more abrasive because of the organic sugar that is in it. However, it starts off grainy but as you rub it in it starts to melt on your lips so it gets oily. It is exfoliating enough to use everyday which I like and because the oils in the product melt while using it is actually pretty moisturizing kind of like lotion for your lips.This is not for heavily chapped lips and it is not like the real sugar scrubs that literally feel like straight sugar. It is creamy and light, great for maintaining soft lips. The taste is not as sweet as I thought it would be and honestly it tastes more like regular body lotion. The jar is a lot bigger than the picture looks. This will definitely last a long time. Great amount for value.</li>
            <li> I love this lip scrub! Its smells amazing!! Perfect for my chappy lips! I highly recommend this lip scrub!! So sweet!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Lip Scrub at a reasonable price and to also says what it does, take off the dead skin cells on your lips without being too harsh on your lips. This jar is very small because you don&#x27;t necessarily need a lot to scrub your lips. It&#x27;s perfect for chapped/dry lips especially in the winter season. It smells good and is made with organic sugar and oils to sooth your lips. Remember, it is not meant to be eaten although the package says; &amp;#34;Soft Candy Vanilla Buttercream&amp;#34;. Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product compared to it&#x27;s leading competition. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Male or Female can utilize this product to reveal smoother softer Lips!</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with dry lips and since I have full lips I had to buy so much lip moisturizing products that are not working .&lt;br /&gt;I use this to scrub my lips twice a day ( Day and night) ,and follow with Coconut cream Lip Balm from the same maker .. My lips are very soft and no more dryness .</li>
            <li> I read awesome reviews on this product so I bought it.  Unfortunately, it was complete liquid when I opened it. I&#x27;m sure the product is awesome, but I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a fair chance.  I think I might try again when the weather turns cooler. Shipping was the issue and hot weather, not the product necessarily.</li>
