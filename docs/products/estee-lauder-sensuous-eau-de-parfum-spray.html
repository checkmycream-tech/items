    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for the second time.  It arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> wife likes it. that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li> This perfume has a good fragrance to it. It is not have a very strong smell to it. I love to put it on anytime.</li>
            <li> Arrived SO quickly; great price for a great fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is the most sensual perfume I have ever smelled.  I found this perfume to be light and not overpowering to the senses.  This perfume is subtle and after it sits on my ladies skin for an hour I will say that it is hard to keep my hands off of her.  The smell is very attractive, not cloying or allergy inducing like so many over powering fruity smells out there today.  This is a classy smelling perfume and never fails to raise my interest.</li>
            <li> my daughter really lked this gift</li>
            <li> todo bien este perfume es esquisito es muy dulte simula le ternura lo recomiendo 100% es exelente lo unico que el vendedor se tarda un poco en entregarlo.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s only fragrance and has a unique scent that many people ask her for the name of it.  Through Amazon I saved $30 over the department store price.  That&#x27;s a deal maker for me.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years and LOVED the price.</li>
            <li> recieved as promised,,,,pleased with this purchas and would order again,i&#x27;m sure the wife will be pleased as it is a x-mas present</li>
            <li> This was a great value on my wifes favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume periodically for many years. They do not admit it, but they have changed the formula. It smells the same but is much more faint. Does not last at all. It seems as if they have added water to stretch the product and (I guess) increase the profits. Shame......time to find a new perfume.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and it lasts for hours. Since I started using it all my friends have told me that they like my new perfume.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  The men love it.  It has a great smell.  Shipped well.</li>
            <li> The spray is broke can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent. Had purchased the smaller one a bit ago and finally got the bigger one. Nice woodsy, musky scent and get compliments on it. Hubby likes it ...that&#x27;s all that really matters. :)  The only downside other than the high cost, is the scent does not last real long at least not on me, but is ok as I do not care for strong perfumes anyways.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume before, and have always gotten compliments on this scent.  My husband thinks it&#x27;s sexy.  Came new, in the box with wrap still on.  Has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume! My favorite scent! Always get compliments when I where it!</li>
            <li> What a geeat price via Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using Estee Lauder Sensous for years. Even strangers in elevators tell me they love my perfume. I also use the body wash and lotion at times. The perfume lasts a long time and is soft.</li>
            <li> Sensuous by Estee Lauder has been my favorite perfume for quite some time. I adore sandalwood. The last time I purchased my perfume was a little over a year ago. The best thing about it was it&#x27;s lasting ability. I would spray a small amount and could still smell it when I woke up the next morning. With this bottle the scent disappears off of my skin faster than much cheaper body sprays. I&#x27;m not sure if I received a lesser quality product or if Estee Lauder has changed their formula. The scent is still heavenly but I wish it lived up to my past experiences.</li>
            <li> The fragrance arrived well packaged and very quicK at a great price. It is an amazing scent and I get alot of compliments when I wear it. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the size of my perfume and for a good price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother. She has been wearing it for decades and absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but you get what is expected.</li>
            <li> I get compliments constantly and have people I work with wearing it also</li>

            <li> Love, love, love this perfume.  The scent is great!  I aways get complements when I use this Estee Lauder Sensuous perfume.</li>
            <li> Very soft scent,it isn&#x27;t overpowering. I apply it and I don&#x27;t smell it but everyone else does. I have been stopped by many to ask what I am wearing.Best price around.It is much more expensive at the department stores.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ever. I always get compliments on it.  I have worn it every day for years now and haven&#x27;t looked at any other scent since!</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft amber scent. Love this perfume</li>

            <li> I knew that she liked this brand, but she seemed especially thrilled to get a gift of this for no special occasion. Appears that women do like pleasant surprises.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to purchase some of this wonderful smelling perfume. I live paycheck to paycheck but I because of my tax return amount, I was able to spoil myself.</li>
            <li> Light sensual fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and at a lower price</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this cologne very much.  However, the scent does not last.  In fact, it wears off fairly quickly, after only a couple of house at most.  You must reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> Sensuous cologne by Est√©e Lauder is one I get more compliments on than any other cologne I own.  The clean not too strong smell makes people stop and ask what I am wearing .. I am into my third bottle since I found it.. The first was the smaller bottle but now I get the larger size.  Love the way it stays with you!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for about 3 yrs now and I LOVE it its a very sexy, but soft and elegant scent if you like woodsy with a touch of sweetness you will LOVE it I know I sure do.</li>
            <li> price was as quoted.  product shipped quickly.  product package was lovely</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sensuous by Estee Lauder for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray&lt;br /&gt;ESTEE LAUDER for my wife, she loves and it last all day without loosing it smell.</li>
            <li> One of my all-time FAVORITES !&lt;br /&gt;Sooooooooooo delicious ~ I have so many to choose from and lately, I keep coming back to this one... It&#x27;s especially warm, lingering, intoxicating, sexy and of course, sensuous. Perfectly named &amp; captured. I like the &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; bottle, too.&lt;br /&gt;My (and someone else&#x27;s) current favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Estee ~ it&#x27;s lovely</li>
