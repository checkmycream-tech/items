            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great moist application with a glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great in the sun.</li>
            <li>Great Product at a fair price and a great seller to deal with.</li>
            <li>I am a fair-</li>
            <li>but for someone who NEVER gets tan without burning, I am SUPER impressed.</li>
            <li>also gave very smooth skin!  </li>
            <li>Love it and it smells great</li>
            <li>Better than oils/lotions, great texture, smell, and consistency.</li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I darkened from fair to a nice light brown.</li>
            <li>better than most that I have used.</li>
            <li>Works well with no lasting odor, not greasy and good for your skin, used it for years!!!</li>
            <li>The lotion/gel is smooth and silky, not greasy at all, absorbs quickly and smells amazing - like orange sherbet!</li>
            <li>Nice mild fragrance that goes away.</li>
            <li>It was so rich &amp; creamy, and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily after tanning.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know, just watch out because I think this lotion is SUUUUPER strong.</li>
            <li>Everything else works just fine for what you expect from tanning accelerants.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and light fragrance</li>
            <li>For the price, quick results, absorption, feel and smell: 5 stars all around!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and definitely helps accelerate your tan.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It has an authentic lotion-like consistency that is superior to many tanning lotions I&#x27;ve encountered, and it&#x27;s moisturizing while not greasy or excessively thick/heavy.</li>
            <li>First off, I often have places to go after I&#x27;ve been tanning, so I needed something light in both smell and texture that wouldn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky, heavy-coated, or smelly post-salon visit.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and easily, quickly absorbing into the skin, and never irritates or stings/burns.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a soft healthy glow post-tan.</li>
            <li>My favorite Austrian gold lotion by far</li>
            <li>QUICK,  EXTREMELY REASONABLE  PRICE (</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most effective accelerator I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price, it&#x27;s tough to beat.</li>
            <li>I laid out in the sun from 1-2pm with this the other day and, while I did get a bit red, I also got the beginning stages of a nice golden glow.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of their other products, but it smells good and works well enough for the price.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a step up from the original Australian Gold Accelerator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan quickly or deeply, but I definitely noticed a difference with this product compared to the original formula of Australian Gold that I used previously.</li>
            <li>A single bottle sure didn&#x27;t last me long,but that&#x27;s fine because in only 6 15 minute sessions spread through two weeks</li>
            <li>So all-in-all, for me this product gets 4 out of 5 stars between the smell and the fact that I can&#x27;t truly tell what it&#x27;s done to improve my tan (other than possibly helping to tan my skin more evenly), but the difference I have FELT in my skin post-tanning rather than SEEN is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>(Unfortunately it&#x27;s only really visible indoors - if I step outside again I&#x27;m still totally Casper white LOL).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend the typical $40+ price on salon lotion, this is a more than decent substitute.</li>
            <li>The scent and consistency are exactly the same as the other lotion, but this one gave me slightly better results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like tingle or cooling lotions because my sensitive skin usually has an adverse reaction, and lotions with any kind of glitter or shimmer</li>
            <li>I also live at an apartment with a pool, so I was hoping to find something that worked for both indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
            <li>I have always found value in Australian Gold products because of their easy access and commendably affordable cost, and I can certainly say that this particular tanning lotion has lived up to the expectations I had for it after reading extensive user reviews prior to purchase.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll need to be consistent to get darker, and am going to try this in a tanning bed next week -</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong, will definitely be getting more :)</li>
            <li>Florida sun can be very harsh and when you want a tan you don&#x27;t want to be outside for very long, so an accelerator like this is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super white and this has helped immensely!</li>
            <li>and I tan very, very minimally - maybe 1 or 2 shades darker if I am lucky, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not too much for male use.</li>
            <li>just as good as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li>Went on quick and absorbed fast, I hate the feeling most lotions leave so this is definitely good for those of us who hate that oily skin feeling from lotion.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little like tropical cough syrup to me, haha, but it fades before I even leave the salon.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i haven&#x27;t bought this version of the tanning accelerator with hemp before. It was so rich &amp; creamy, and it smells fantastic! It gives your skin a soft healthy glow post-tan.</li>
            <li> I have always found value in Australian Gold products because of their easy access and commendably affordable cost, and I can certainly say that this particular tanning lotion has lived up to the expectations I had for it after reading extensive user reviews prior to purchase. I am a fair- and sensitive-skinned 25-year-old newlywed living on a teacher&#x27;s salary and a half, so trying to find a tanning lotion that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank but that would also stand the test of my super-picky standards started off as a challenge. First off, I often have places to go after I&#x27;ve been tanning, so I needed something light in both smell and texture that wouldn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky, heavy-coated, or smelly post-salon visit. I also live at an apartment with a pool, so I was hoping to find something that worked for both indoor and outdoor tanning. Additionally, I have had some bad experiences with lotions containing bronzers due to unbecoming orange streaks and discolored hands on occasion, so I was trying to avoid a lotion that had any special qualities such as that. I don&#x27;t like tingle or cooling lotions because my sensitive skin usually has an adverse reaction, and lotions with any kind of glitter or shimmer do the same. This lotion hit the mark on all counts of my standards, just as the reviews promised. It applies smoothly and easily, quickly absorbing into the skin, and never irritates or stings/burns. It has an authentic lotion-like consistency that is superior to many tanning lotions I&#x27;ve encountered, and it&#x27;s moisturizing while not greasy or excessively thick/heavy.

I will be purchasing again!e purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Great Product at a fair price and a great seller to deal with. Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> better than most that I have used.</li>
            <li> I am kinda blown away by this product. I am one of those super-white, pasty pale people (you know, that glowing white blob you see on the beach!) and I tan very, very minimally - maybe 1 or 2 shades darker if I am lucky, and that&#x27;s it. I usually just burn, and only when I burn do I actually go tan (and it disappears within 3-4 days LOL). I laid out in the sun from 1-2pm with this the other day and, while I did get a bit red, I also got the beginning stages of a nice golden glow. (Unfortunately it&#x27;s only really visible indoors - if I step outside again I&#x27;m still totally Casper white LOL). I know I&#x27;ll need to be consistent to get darker, and am going to try this in a tanning bed next week - but for someone who NEVER gets tan without burning, I am SUPER impressed. The lotion/gel is smooth and silky, not greasy at all, absorbs quickly and smells amazing - like orange sherbet! I went back to work and had no issues with being greasy, oily or gross. For the price, quick results, absorption, feel and smell: 5 stars all around! Can&#x27;t go wrong, will definitely be getting more :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells wonderful even after being out in the sun...doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; like a lot of tanning lotions tend to do when mixed with sweat. About to purchase my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of their other products, but it smells good and works well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells really good! also gave very smooth skin!  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but i prefer the spray.</li>
            <li> Great item! Love it and it smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and definitely helps accelerate your tan.</li>
            <li> Great moist application with a glow to the skin. Florida sun can be very harsh and when you want a tan you don&#x27;t want to be outside for very long, so an accelerator like this is great.</li>
            <li> Nice mild fragrance that goes away. Does not grease my face with a heavy look or feel. It&#x27;s all I want for short exposure periods under ninety minutes, now.</li>
            <li> After using half a dozen times for indoor tanning, I don&#x27;t see a real improvement over the base tan I already had.  Easy to apply and light fragrance that&#x27;s not too much for male use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it says &amp;#34;Gelee&amp;#34; on the bottle. It is the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years and is not a gel, but a lotion. Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> My favorite Austrian gold lotion by far</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on smoothly. Washes off easily after tanning. Inexpensive and affordable.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! GOT HERE QUICK,  EXTREMELY REASONABLE  PRICE (and I have used them all ranging from $8 to $80)... I will DEFINITELY BE BURNING AGAIN!  THANKS!</li>
            <li> I am giving this lotion a 3 star today because I started getting these ugly, brown, sunspot looking dots on my arm as soon as I started tanning with this lotion. I&#x27;ve been tanning for 3 years and I&#x27;ve NEVER seen these type of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; on my body. It might be different for everyone but i don&#x27;t know, just watch out because I think this lotion is SUUUUPER strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super white and this has helped immensely! I can wear my white shorts now! I just use this by the pool and it&#x27;s great in the sun.</li>
            <li> Like this gelee a lot. Better than oils/lotions, great texture, smell, and consistency. Stayed out in the sun @ a water park and didn&#x27;t burn. Skin stayed moisturized throughout. Really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Really works!</li>
            <li> just as good as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> This lotion is a step up from the original Australian Gold Accelerator. But an even bigger plus, I had NO after-tanning smell when using this lotion in a tanning bed. I did not know such a thing was possible! If you don&#x27;t want to spend the typical $40+ price on salon lotion, this is a more than decent substitute. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan quickly or deeply, but I definitely noticed a difference with this product compared to the original formula of Australian Gold that I used previously. The scent and consistency are exactly the same as the other lotion, but this one gave me slightly better results. It&#x27;s not the most effective accelerator I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price, it&#x27;s tough to beat. Also note--there is no bronzer in this product.</li>
            <li> Works well with no lasting odor, not greasy and good for your skin, used it for years!!!</li>
